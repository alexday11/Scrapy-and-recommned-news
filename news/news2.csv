Ex-doctor goes on trial in France over Rwanda genocide,"    Sosthene Munyemana, 68, is accused of organizing torture and killings during the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda. He has lived in France since 1994. ","A Rwandan former gynecologist went on trial in France on Tuesday, November 14, on charges of committing genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1994 massacres in Rwanda, in an investigation stretching back nearly three decades. It is one of France's longest-running cases.Sixty-eight-year-old Sosthene Munyemana appeared before the criminal court in the French capital nearly 30 years after a complaint was filed against him in the southwestern French city of Bordeaux in 1995. The former gynecologist, accused of organizing torture and killings during the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda, arrived late for the hearing. Wearing a blue striped shirt and a grey jacket, Munyemana apologized for the delay, before stating his identity. He has lived in France since 1994.Munyemana, who denies the charges, faces life in prison if convicted. The trial, scheduled to last five weeks, will be recorded for historical archives. Nearly 70 witnesses are expected to testify. It is the sixth such trial in France of an alleged participant in the massacres, in which around 800,000 people, most of them ethnic Tutsis, were slaughtered over 100 days.""We're waiting for justice to be done at last,"" Rachel Lindon, a lawyer representing 26 victims, said ahead of the trial. ""The more time passes, the fewer witnesses we have,"" she added.In 2008, France rejected an asylum request by Munyemana, who worked in a hospital at Villeneuve-sur-Lot in southwest France for a decade. But it also in 2010 rejected an extradition request from Rwanda after Munyemana's lawyers argued he could not receive a fair trial there. In 2011, a French court charged the father of three on suspicion he took part in the 1994 genocide.An ethnic Hutu, he lived in Butare in southern Rwanda at the time of the massacre. France has been one of the top destinations for fugitives fleeing justice over the Rwandan slaughter. Rwanda under President Paul Kagame has accused Paris of not being willing to extradite genocide suspects or bring them to justice. Since 2014, France has tried and convicted several figures including a former spy chief, two ex-mayors and a former hotel chauffeur.""He was a doctor, a well-known man who was much appreciated,"" said Emmanuel Daoud, a lawyer for the two rights organizations, the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) and the Human Rights League (LDH). ""He could not have been unaware of what was happening,"" he added.Munyemana was close to Jean Kambanda, the head of the interim government established after the plane carrying then-president Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down by a missile in 1994. He is accused of signing a letter of support for the interim government, which encouraged the massacre of the Tutsis. He is also accused of keeping Tutsi civilians in inhumane conditions in local government offices to which he had the key.Munyemana does not deny having held the key but argues that the offices served as a ""refuge"" for Tutsis who were seeking protection. Munyemana's lawyer, Jean-Yves Dupeux, argued that the case ""rests only"" on eyewitness accounts that date back to decades ago. ""It's very difficult to rely on testimonies about something that happened so long ago,"" he said.Munyemana worked as an emergency doctor in southwestern France before switching to geriatrics. More than 800,000 people, mainly minority Tutsis, were massacred by Hutu soldiers and extremist militias in the Rwandan genocide from April to July 1994, according to UN figures.",/en/global-issues/
"Being gay and Catholic, a difficult journey 'between two worlds'",    Some Catholics experience an ongoing internal conflict between their faith and their identity as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. This issue has become central to the deliberations of the synod taking place in Rome. ,"Antoine knew his identity early on and has never doubted it since. The 39-year-old was 10 when he realized he was attracted to men. Since then, explained the devout Catholic, ""everything gets stuck when you don't want to lie.""""Imagine being a young, practicing Catholic and having the feeling that hell is all around you, ready to swallow you up if you decide to make the slightest faux pas, like kissing another boy,"" said Antoine, who still keeps his sexual orientation a secret from some people, notably in his parish, requesting anonymity like most of those who agreed to share their stories.Trying to suppress his desires and reconcile them with his faith, Antoine decided to become a priest. ""It also helps to explain to others why, as a teenager, you don't like football, why you don't get into fights, why you don't have a girlfriend,"" he said with a smile. But a document published by the Vatican in 2005, banning the ordination of homosexual priests, halted his plans. He then chose to enter a monastery, a place where, he thought, chastity would be easier and temptations less prevalent. He stayed there from the time he was 22 until he was 36 and only started to embrace his love life after leaving.Like Antoine, many French people are struggling to reconcile their Catholic faith with their identity as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Although many parishes and clergy are striving to be more inclusive and sensitive to this issue, homosexuality is still considered problematic within the Church.Less conservative than his predecessors Benedict XVI and John Paul II, Pope Francis has repeatedly expressed his desire to create a more inclusive Church. Currently, the issue has surfaced at his Synod on Synodality, an important meeting on the future of the institution, being held from October 4 to 29 in Rome. The working documents of this major assembly raise questions about ""concrete"" measures to ""reach out to people who feel excluded from the Church because of their affectivity and sexuality"" (for example, remarried divorcees, people living in polygamous marriages, LGBTQ+ people, etc.).More specifically, it concerns the question of the blessing of homosexual couples, a request made by many believers but opposed by the most conservative elements of the Church, believing that it effectively amounts to the institution recognizing a lifestyle deemed ""disordered.""In Catholic teaching, being attracted to a person of the same sex is not a sin in itself, but sexual acts, practices or married life are considered sins. Thus, a fulfilling life, faithful to one's orientation, seems to be a challenge for believers because it opposes the Church's point of view. ""Suppression of feelings and desires,"" ""inner and moral suffering,"" ""loss of confidence and self-esteem,"" ""guilt and anxiety"": Many LGBTQ+ people feel excluded, with no real place within an institution where sexual morality essentially revolves around a heterosexual couple dedicated to procreation. ""French Catholicism is fairly conservative on these issues, compared to Germany and Belgium, despite the recent changes in the Church's perspective on the issue, particularly after the legalization of same-sex marriage. The clergy are having real difficulty speaking out on these subjects,"" explained Céline Béraud, sociologist at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales.",/en/global-issues/
At least 14 French airports receive bomb threats,"    After a number of major French airports were evacuated on Wednesday, many more were the targets of bomb threats on Thursday, leading to at least eight being temporarily evacuated. ","At least 14 French airports received bomb threats on Thursday, October 19, with at least eight evacuated, in the latest series of false alarms that have rattled the country over the past week.Most of France's major airports – with the exception of its two biggest in Paris – were temporarily evacuated on Wednesday, leading to at least 130 flight cancellations.On Thursday, the evacuations were focused on small airports such as Brest, Carcassonne, Bordeaux and Montpellier.Aviation authority DGAC confirmed the bomb threats without giving a precise number, while several airports put out social media messages about the evacuations and checks by security forces.France, which has large Jewish and Muslim populations, has been on high alert since Hamas's assault on Israel and since a teacher was killed last week by an attacker who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State extremist group.""It's a serious nuisance, but we take zero risks,"" said a spokesperson for Bordeaux-Merignac Airport, which had already seen a three-hour evacuation on Wednesday that led to a dozen flights being canceled.Transport Minister Clement Beaune wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday that ""planned false alerts are dangerous and unacceptable,"" adding that offenders risk two years in prison and a €30,000 fine.The Louvre Museum and Palace of Versailles have also received threats in recent days, leading to temporary closures.",/en/global-issues/
India's Supreme Court declines to legalize same-sex marriage,"    The judges felt they had no authority to rule on the matter, leaving it to Parliament to legislate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is hostile to such legislation, which he believes would threaten 'the values accepted by society.' ","Same-sex marriage will not be allowed in India. On Tuesday, October 17, the Indian Supreme Court rejected the applications of 21 petitioners, including same-sex couples, trans people and associations. The judges considered that they were not empowered to make such a decision and referred this responsibility to Parliament, as the government had wanted.The hopes of the LGBT+ community were high, as India's highest court had issued a landmark ruling in 2018 decriminalizing homosexuality. The only notable progress concerned marriage for couples where one of the members is transgender. The Supreme Court considered that there is no obstacle to transsexual people entering into marriage, provided they are identified as a ""man"" and a ""woman"" respectively.It is unlikely that Modi's government will be tempted to legislate, as the judges are urging. During hearings in April and May, the prime minister's representative had expressed his hostility to same-sex marriage in the name of the unity of the family, arguing that this consisted of a husband, a wife and children. ""Any interference in this area (...) would completely upset the delicate balance of laws relating to the individual in the country and the values accepted by society,"" he claimed.""I doubt that the BJP [ Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party] would even want the issue to be debated in Parliament, let alone passed into law,"" commented Shashi Tharoor, an MP for Congress, the main opposition party, speaking after the decision.However, the debates before the high court had been of high quality in a rather calm atmosphere, very different from the demonstrations that had accompanied the adoption of the same-sex marriage law in France.The five judges who reviewed the applications were divided. They each read out their position before announcing a joint decision. While the petitioners demanded that LGBT+ couples be granted the same rights as heterosexual families in terms of adoption, insurance and inheritance, on the basis of the principle of equality of citizens, Chief Justice Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud argued that there is no fundamental right to marriage. However, he insisted on the country's duty to grant some form of recognition to same-sex relationships, and to protect them against all forms of discrimination. ""I didn't expect the judgment to be very good, but it's much worse than I expected,"" said Uday Raj Anand, one of the petitioners.Despite the decriminalization of homosexuality in India, the lives of couples remain exposed to family and social violence. With the recognition of marriage, petitioners and militant associations hoped to strengthen their protection.",/en/global-issues/
Mexico: Three separate armed attacks leave 24 dead,"    In an 'extraordinary' outbreak of pre-electoral violence, the attacks in western and central Mexico targeted a security patrol, the brother of a mayor, and rival drug dealers. ","Three separate armed attacks in Mexico on Monday left at least 24 people dead, including a dozen police officers, authorities said about the latest violence to hit regions plagued by drug trafficking.In the deadliest incident, unidentified attackers targeted a security patrol in Guerrero state's municipality of Coyuca de Benitez, prosecutor Alejandro Hernandez said. At least 13 people were killed and two others wounded in that attack, the state prosecutor's office said in a statement, with Hernandez earlier having confirmed that at least 11 of those killed were members of the municipal police force.A senior state security official was traveling in the convoy when it was attacked, authorities said, without confirming media reports that he was murdered along with police bodyguards. Security forces were later seen patrolling the area – where several lifeless bodies lay on the ground – as a police helicopter flew overhead.Another attack, in the neighboring western state of Michoacan, left five people dead and two more injured, authorities said. A group of gunmen attacked the brother of the mayor of the town of Tacambaro, according to the state prosecutor's office. A restaurant worker and a member of the police force were among those killed, while the mayor's brother was wounded, it said. In a video posted on social media, gunmen were seen opening fire before fleeing in several vehicles.A third attack on Monday, a gunfight between alleged drug dealers in the central Mexican state of Puebla, left at least six dead and two wounded, the regional government reported. The incident took place in the rural community of San Miguel Canoa, about 120 kilometers from Mexico City.Mexico is plagued by cartel-related bloodshed that has seen more than 420,000 people murdered since the government deployed the military in its war on drugs in 2006. Since then, the country's murder rate has tripled to 25 per 100,000 inhabitants. Mexico has also registered more than 110,000 disappearances since 1962, most attributed to criminal organizations.Guerrero and Michoacan are among the country's most violent areas, due to confrontations between rival drug traffickers and security forces. Although it is home to the famed coastal resort of Acapulco, Guerrero is one of Mexico's poorest states.Violence – particularly targeting low-level officials – often escalates across the country in the run-up to elections. Presidential and parliamentary polls are set to be held next year.Even so, experts said the latest wave of violence was particularly shocking. ""Guerrero has long seen one of Mexico's most complicated armed conflicts, but the current, pre-electoral levels of violence are extraordinary,"" Falko Ernst, an analyst at International Crisis Group, wrote on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.Since taking office in 2018, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has championed a ""hugs not bullets"" strategy to tackle violent crime at its roots by fighting poverty and inequality with social programs, rather than with the army.",/en/global-issues/
EU awards major Freedom of Thought prize to Mahsa Amini,"    22-year-old Mahsa Amini, the Iranian Kurdish woman whose death in Iranian custody a year ago triggered mass protests in Iran, and also a global movement known as 'Woman, Life, Freedom', received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. ","The European Union on Thursday, October 19, awarded its top human rights honor, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, to Mahsa Amini, the Iranian Kurdish woman who died in Iranian custody a year ago, and the ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" movement her death triggered.""The brutal murder of 22-year-old Jina Mahsa Amini marked a turning point. It has triggered a women-led movement that is making history,"" European Parliament speaker Roberta Metsola said, using Amini's Kurdish first name as she announced the award. Metsola said the movement's three-word slogan was ""a rallying cry for all those standing up for equality, for dignity, and for freedom in Iran"". The EU prize announcement comes two weeks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to an imprisoned Iranian rights campaigner, Narges Mohammadi.Amini died at age 22 on September 16, 2022, while being held by Iran's religious police for allegedly breaching the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women. Her family and supporters say she was killed. Iranian authorities claim she died in custody from a previously undisclosed medical condition.Her death triggered mass protests in Iran. It also generated a global movement known as ""Woman, Life, Freedom"", calling for the end of Iran's imposition of a headscarf on all women and an end to the Muslim cleric-led government in Tehran.Iranian security forces have cracked down on the protests domestically, killing hundreds, and have executed dozens for allegedly participating in what officials have called ""riots"". This week, they jailed Amini's lawyer, Saleh Nikbakht, for one year for ""propaganda"" after he spoke to the media about her case.Many Iranian women continue to defy the government's clothing edict by taking off their headscarves in public. The ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" campaign continues in cities around the world, with frequent demonstrations in which Amini's photo is held aloft.Mohammadi's Nobel Peace Prize was in recognition of her fight against the mandatory headscarf in Iran and against the oppression of women in the country. Together, the two prizes focus attention on Iranian authorities' punishment of women who defy the headscarf order, seen by both sides as defiance of the Islamic Republic's system of governance itself.Amini and the ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" movement were backed by the European Parliament's three main political groups, making them the frontrunner well before the Sakharov Prize winner was announced.The two other nominations on the shortlist, backed by smaller groups, were Nicaraguan rights defenders, Vilma Nunez de Escorcia and Bishop Rolando Jose Alvarez Lagos; and three women campaigning for abortion rights, Justyna Wydrzynska from Poland, Morena Herrera from Salvador and Colleen McNicholas from the United States. Billionaire Elon Musk had been put forward in an initial round by a far-right grouping in the parliament but failed to make the cut for the shortlist.The Sakharov Prize, which comes with a €50,000 ($53,000) endowment, will be handed over in a European Parliament ceremony on December 13.",/en/global-issues/
"Spanish Catholic clergy sexually abused more than 200,000 children, report estimates","    Presenting the findings, Spain's national ombudsman criticized the church's response to abuse and recommended the establishment of a reparation fund. ","Over 200,000 minors are estimated to have been sexually abused in Spain by the Roman Catholic clergy since 1940, according to an independent commission published on Friday, October 27.The report did not give a specific figure but said a poll of over 8,000 people found that 0.6% of Spain's adult population of around 39 million people said they had suffered sexual abuse by members of the clergy when they were still children.The percentage rises to 1.13% – or over 400,000 people – when including abuse by lay members, Spain's national ombudsman Ángel Gabilondo told a news conference called to present the findings of the report which has over 700 pages.The revelations in Spain are the latest to rock the Roman Catholic Church after a series of sexual abuse scandals around the world, often involving children, over the past 20 years.The commission also interviewed 487 victims, who stressed ""the emotional problems"" the abuse has caused them, Gabilondo said. ""There are people who have (died by) suicide... people who have never put their lives back together,"" the former Socialist education minister said.Teresa Conde, a philosophy teacher who was abused for years by a friar starting at the age of 14 when she attended a religious school in the northwestern city of Salamanca in the early 1980, said she is ""never going to be a normal person."" ""I'm never going to stop doing therapy or taking medicine,"" the 57-year-old told Agence France-Presse (AFP).Unlike in other nations, in Spain – a traditionally Catholic country that has become highly secular – clerical abuse allegations only recently started to gain traction, leading to accusations by survivors of stonewalling.The report is critical of the response of the Catholic Church, saying ""it has long been characterized by denial and attempts to downplay the issue."" It recommended the creation of a state fund to pay reparations to victims.""Unfortunately, for many years there has been a certain desire to deny abuses or a desire to conceal or protect the abusers,"" said Gabilondo.Spain's parliament in March 2022 overwhelmingly approved the creation of an independent commission led by the country's ombudsman to look into clerical abuse.The country's Catholic Church, which for years flatly refused to carry out its own probe, declined to take part in the probe, although it did cooperate by providing documents on cases of sexual abuse that had been collected by dioceses.But as political pressure mounted, it tasked a private law firm in February 2022 with an ""audit"" into past and present sexual abuse by clergy, teachers and others associated with the Church, which should be completed by the end of the year.The Spanish church has also set up protocols for dealing with sexual abuse and has set up ""child protection"" offices within dioceses.Contacted by AFP, the Spanish bishops' conference said it would react to the commission's report on Monday at an extraordinary meeting.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the release of the report was a ""milestone"" in the country's democratic history. ""Today we are a slightly better country, because a reality that everyone was for years aware of but no one talked about, has been made known,"" the Socialist premier told reporters in Brussels.Juan Cuatrecasas, a founding member of the ""Infancia Robada"" (Stolen Childhood) victims' association and the father of a youth who was abused by a teacher at a Catholic school in Bilbao, said lawmakers now must ensure repairs are made. ""This must be the start of something, not an end in itself,"" he told AFP.The Roman Catholic Church's abuse crisis exploded onto the international stage in 2002 when the Boston Globe newspaper revealed priests had sexually abused children for decades and church leaders had covered it up.Patterns of widespread abuse of children were later reported across the United States and Europe, in Chile and Australia, undercutting the moral authority of the 1.3 billion-member Church and taking a toll on its membership.An independent commission in France for example concluded in 2021 that some 216,000 children – mostly boys – had been sexually abused by clergy since 1950.",/en/global-issues/
Putin revokes Russia's ratification of nuclear test ban treaty,"    The Russian president signed a law withdrawing Russia's ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which has never come into force as China, the US and 6 others never ratified it. ","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday signed a law revoking Russia's ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The 1996 treaty outlaws all nuclear explosions, including live tests of nuclear weapons, though it never came into force because some key countries – including the United States and China – never ratified it.The West has accused Russia of using reckless nuclear rhetoric since it launched its offensive on Ukraine last February. Putin last week oversaw ballistic missile drills in what Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said was practice for a ""massive"" retaliatory nuclear strike against an unnamed enemy. Putin also said last month he was ""not ready to say"" whether Russia would carry out live nuclear tests.The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) has urged Russia to continue its commitment to the treaty, including the operation on its territory of monitoring stations capable of detecting the slightest explosion in real-time. ""Today's decision by the Russian Federation to revoke its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is very disappointing and deeply regrettable,"" CTBTO head Robert Floyd said on X, formerly known as Twitter.The bill to revoke the treaty passed through Russia's parliament last month in a fast-track process. During parliamentary hearings, State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said the move to revoke the treaty was a response to the United States' ""cynicism"" and ""boorish attitudes"" on nuclear weapons.Although it never entered into force, the agreement was ratified by 178 countries, including nuclear powers France and Britain, and has symbolic value. Its backers say it established an international norm against live tests of nuclear weapons, but critics say the potential of the deal remains unrealized without the ratification of major nuclear powers. Russia's parliament ratified the agreement in June 2000, six months after Putin first became president.",/en/global-issues/
Iran sentences woman to death for adultery,"    Iran faces global scrutiny for its frequent use of the death penalty. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday said that Iran has executed 419 individuals in the first seven months of this year, marking a 30% increase from the previous year. ","An Iranian court has sentenced a woman to death for adultery, state media said. A report by the IRAN newspaper on Wednesday, November 1, said the woman worked as a trainer in a gym for females. It said her husband contacted police in 2022 when he found her with another man at their home. The husband discovered from surveillance cameras that she was having relations with other men, the report added. Under Iranian law, she can appeal the sentence.Iranian courts sometimes sentence people to death by stoning for adultery, which can be reduced to lighter punishments upon appeal. Iran is under international pressure for its extensive use of the death penalty. On Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Iran was executing people at ""an alarming rate."" He said at least 419 people received capital punishment in the first seven months of this year, an increase of 30% from the same period last year.In 2017, a court sentenced a woman to death for adultery but there has been no report of her execution since then. Crimes punishable by the death penalty in Iran include adultery, sodomy, murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and drug trafficking. In 2022, Iran executed two gay men who were convicted of sodomy.",/en/global-issues/
Women sent back to the locker rooms at the Parliamentary Rugby World Cup,"    During this competition, held in France from August 31 to September 7, English and South African players refused to play against mixed teams. This attitude dampened the atmosphere at an event that was as much about sport as it was about diplomacy. ","While the eyes of the world are on the Rugby World Cup in France, another, more private competition recently played out on the rugby pitches. From August 31 to September 7, the Parliamentary Rugby World Cup was held in Toulouse, Sarlat (Dordogne) and Paris.Eight teams (South Africa, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the European Parliament and France) came together for this tournament, originally created in 1995 and first played in South Africa under the leadership of Nelson Mandela. Here, the players are not professionals, but parliamentarians, former parliamentarians, or parliamentary staff or agents.Most of the squads have been mixed since the last round, held in Japan in 2019, and three women are part of the French team, the ""XV Parlementaire."" ""We're happy to play with our male colleagues; they're warriors on the pitch, but real gentlemen off it; it's the esprit de corps and cooperation that brings us together in this rugby team, not that of competition,"" explained Véronique Riotton, Renaissance MP.Unfortunately, at this year's event, the positive atmosphere resulting from these humanist and sporting values was dampened. The delegations from the UK and South Africa made it known several weeks before the tournament kicked off that they refused to play against mixed teams.The President of the XV Parlementaire team, Jean-François Portarrieu, was circumspect in his response. For the Horizons MP, who has played rugby since childhood, the British and South African teams were hiding behind an administrative reason to impose a conservative conception of the sport.The South African team, followed by the English team, put forward rugby federations' ban on insuring players in plexus tackle matches if women are involved. They are only allowed to take part in so-called recreational rugby matches, where tackling is done at the waist. ""Their arguments are valid, but they have refused on principle to change the rules. Our vision of parliamentary rugby is inclusive, whereas theirs is about winning,"" said Portarrieu.Vice-president of the XV Parlementaire and Renaissance MP, Annaïg Le Meur spoke out before the match between the French team and the South Africans. ""Véronique Riotton and I wanted to express our discontent and our vision of sport, and defend all the women in the competition. The refusal of the South Africans and the English cast a pall over the whole event, which is as much a sporting event as a diplomatic one,"" said the official, who is also the team's physiotherapist. ""They hijacked the game. Our aim is not to win, but to share a time with other rugby-loving nations.""",/en/m-le-mag/
Iranian teenager dies in suspicious circumstances reminiscent of Mahsa Amini's death,"    Attacked in the metro for not wearing a headscarf, 17-year-old Armita Geravand died on Saturday after several weeks in a coma. The regime denies the incident. Her funeral led to several arrests. ","Armita Geravand was 17. She loved Korean pop music, took part in taekwondo and enjoyed painting. She was attacked on October 1 in the Teheran metro by women working for the Iranian regime because she was not wearing a headscarf. After four weeks in a coma, the teenager died on Saturday, October 28, in a Tehran hospital. She was buried on Sunday in the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in the south of the city, in the presence of numerous plainclothes security forces.At her funeral, a dozen people were arrested, including the well-known Iranian lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, the 2012 winner of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The Iranian authorities deny any responsibility for Geravand's death, alleging that she hit her head on the floor after fainting due to a fall in blood pressure.The girl's death tragically echoes that of Mahsa (Jina) Amini, who died on September 16, 2022. Beaten in police custody because of her ""improperly worn"" headscarf, she too fell into a coma. When her death was announced, Iran was overwhelmed by a wave of protests of unprecedented scope and duration.For months, Iranians across the country took to the streets to vent their anger at the Islamic Republic government. More than 500 people were killed, including dozens of children. Even today, Iranian women go out into the streets without headscarves to denounce this compulsory requirement. They risk harassment, arrest, fines, confiscation of their cars and dismissal from their jobs.In recent weeks, Iranians have reported the presence of plainclothes agents, particularly in subway stations, who attack women deemed ""not properly covered."" According to sources quoted by BBC Persian, Geravand was jostled by a group of ""hejabban"" (""hijab supervisors"" in Persian) because she was not wearing her headscarf, which had fallen over her shoulders. Her head then hit a metal bar in a train car. The Iranian authorities deny this version of events. They have published images recorded by surveillance cameras in the station, but none from inside the carriage where the incident happened.The girl's parents and friends were interviewed several times by Iranian state television, a propaganda tool, repeating the version put forward by the regime. However, some Iranians, pointing to the desperate look on the faces of those interviewed and their disorganized speech, believe that the girl's relatives were forced to say these things. Forced statements are common in Iran.",/en/global-issues/
Macron plans to make abortion an 'irreversible' constitutional right in France,"    In an online post on Sunday, the French president said, 'In 2024, the right of women to choose abortion will become irreversible.' ","French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday, October 29, his government plans to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution to make them ""irreversible"".In an online post, Macron said a draft project would be submitted to the State Council, France's highest administrative court, this coming week, with a view to making abortion rights constitutional by the end of the year. ""In 2024, the right of women to choose abortion will become irreversible,"" he said.The announcement follows a promise Macron made on March 8, International Women's Day, which was seen as a response to the overturning of federal abortion rights in the United States last year.Constitutional revision in France requires either a referendum or approval by at least three-fifths of the members of both chambers of parliament united in a congress. Most constitutional changes in post-war France have been approved by congressional vote.The termination of a pregnancy was decriminalized in France in 1975 and successive laws have since aimed at improving conditions for abortions, notably by protecting the health and anonymity of women, as well as reducing the financial burden of the procedure on women.A November 2022 opinion poll found that 89 percent of respondents were in favor of making abortion rights constitutional. According to government figures, 234,000 abortions were carried out in France last year.",/en/global-issues/
Pope Francis attempts to instill a new culture in the Catholic Church,"    At the end of the synod intended by the pontiff to be an assembly at the service of everyone, a report was drawn up which raises the possibility of ordaining women deacons. ","Liturgy does not tolerate equality. On Sunday morning, October 29, at the closing Mass of the first assembly of the Synod on Synodality, the great meeting called by Pope Francis to reflect on the future of the Catholic Church, everyone once again took their rightful place in Rome's Saint Peter's Basilica: cardinals dressed in green chasubles in first place, then bishops, also in green, and finally the laity. But for four weeks, from October 4 to 29, they sat side by side at round tables set up for the occasion in Paul VI Hall, to discuss possible changes in the governance of the Catholic Church.In this way, the assembly visually embodied the change in culture sought by a pope eager to see the faithful participate more actively in the government of the institution. For the first time in history, the assembly even included women. 54 out of 365 were able to vote. On the menu for these four weeks of discussions, which many found a little long, based on questions raised by the faithful from around the world who were interviewed for the occasion: the place of women in the Catholic Church, the inclusion of LGBTQ people, the excessive role of clerics, and the fight against sexual abuse and violence.On Saturday evening, the assembly, which was only the first - the next, which should be conclusive, will take place in October 2024 - delivered the summary report of its work in Italian. The text, admittedly provisional, contains no definitive recommendations, but instead puts forward suggestions and leaves open questions presented as ""issues to be addressed."" Unsurprisingly, the place of women in the Catholic Church, which all the faithful spoke about to a greater or lesser extent in their pre-synod feedback, figured prominently.The discussions focused in particular on the possibility of ordaining women deacons, those ministers of religion whose role is to assist priests in their liturgical duties. Although the chapter devoted to this question was adopted on Saturday, like the rest of the text presented, it was also the one that received the most negative votes, a sign of the still strong differences of opinion among the prelates on the desirability of giving more room to women, who represent half of the 1.3 billion Catholics. For ""some,"" it said, ""such a step would be unacceptable because it would break with tradition.""Another obvious point of division is the issue of homosexuality. While the acronym LGBTQ originally appeared in the working document, it had completely disappeared from the final synthesis in favor of ""gender identity"" and ""sexual orientation."" The chapter that timidly evokes a more inclusive church on this subject also met with more opposition than the others. On Saturday, American Jesuit James Martin, a leading defender of the LGBTQ community in the church and a member of the synod's general assembly, made no secret of his disappointment. ""There were widely diverging views on the topic. I wish, however, that some of those discussions, which were frank and open, had been captured in the final synthesis,"" he told the American website National Catholic Reporter.",/en/global-issues/
Five restaurants in Lille that pack a punch,"    'Le Monde' presents five places in the northern French city that break with convention, and are sure to make your tastebuds happy. ","For the past 10 years, a new generation of inspired chefs has been thwarting convention and clichés. Beyond dishes such as Welsh rarebit and sugar tarts, they have reclaimed a rich history that extends to the Dunkirk coast.With its 10 stalls over two floors, the Grand'Scène food court has put the Rue de Béthune back on Lille's food map. Le Monde's favorite counter? Ataya: The king of falafel (€9) who has already put a bit of northern French style in his Syrian recipes, like his falafaluche (falafels served in faluche, a brioche-style bread) and ch'tiwarma (chawarma with Maroilles cheese).In spite of its somewhat canteen-style décor, behind its beautiful glass façade, Suzanne hides one of the most promising tables in the city with menus starting at €24 that have nothing to envy those of more upscale restaurants. Lucas Tricot dares to do almost everything: egg yolk used like bottarga (dried, smoked and grated) and veal tartar with smoked eel. Boldness, more boldness, always boldness.At only 27 years old, Damien Laforce has already done a lot of work, notably with on the sets of French cooking competition show Top Chef. He impresses the most when he emancipates himself cooking game. Melting venison with blood sauce, hare à la royale, braised wild boar shoulder: The young hunter aims at greediness and sharing, and hits the bull's eye. Lunchtime set menus start at €25.The reed bends but does not break. Diego Delbecq and Camille Pailleau have been through the tumult of the great restaurants, but have never given up. Now independent, their cooking is virtuoso: eel tartlet, oyster paired with veal and kimchi, pavlova with quince and Timut pepper. There is surely a star on the horizon. Menus from €37.At Brique Land, the North takes on an American accent. Located in the huge brick building of an old spinning mill, this brewery with its vintage decor is perfect for evenings with friends (think foosball, big sofas). The choice of house beers is significant (about ten brews including two ephemeral ones every month). La Bagarre (double IPA at 7.7°), whose bitterness is quickly softened by fruity notes, is a delicious knockout.",/en/food/
Seven charming places to stay in rural France,Selection,"At the entrance to the Parc National du Mercantour, facing the Bois-Noir mountain, the Auberge de la Roche overlooks the Vallée de la Tinée, between Nice and the Auron and Isola 2000 ski resorts. Up there, at an altitude of 1,000 meters, the air is pure and the silence is barely disturbed by the village bells. Louis-Philippe Riel and Mickaëlle Chabat, a couple in their 30s from Paris, have teamed up with chef Alexis Bijaoui, who looks after the vegetable garden (he studied with chef and vegetable connoisseur Alain Passard). At this inn, you can choose one of its two bedrooms or three suites, furnished with objects lovingly found by Chabat. You'll also dine on leeks, squash, celeriac and Jerusalem artichokes, which feature in dishes throughout the winter. The restaurant buys from local and organic producers to compose menus where vegetables sits alongside roasted pig or majestic tuna, among other things. Enjoy food and a view that you'll not forget in a hurry.His Parisian restaurant was called Orties. But Thomas Benady fled the capital to pursue his botanical predilection near Mont-Saint-Michel. Now he is a wild picker and collects samphire, obione and purslane along the beaches, picks blackberries and mushrooms on the paths and hunts down abandoned orchards, which often provide apples and sometimes kiwis. His Auberge Sauvage is a tastefully renovated 16th century presbytery. The garden, self-sufficient in herbs (such as basil, coriander, cumin, caraway and lovage), provides all kinds of vegetables and will soon produce fruit – six trees have been planted. Around a large table d'hôte or smaller round tables, the unique menu is, of course, mostly plant-based and sometimes vegetarian, although the chef is not one to turn down salt-meadow lamb or Channel lobster. As for the three elegant rooms, they are named Melissa, Passionflower and Hogweed, a plant known for its soothing properties.In this delightful 17th century hamlet nestled in the Perche, there are five houses that form D'une Ile, where you can both stay and eat (a simple snack is prepared for lunch). The founders of the Septime restaurant Bertrand Grébaut and Théo Pourriat infused some of the savory, bistronomic spirit of their Parisian restaurant, when they bought the place in 2018. Olive oil is off-limits, since they only cook with local products (including rapeseed oil, which is just as good for your health). With a revamped, chic countryside vibe, the 10 rooms can accommodate up to 26 people, and the new ""super suite"" includes three bedrooms and a kitchenette, making it an ideal retreat for a (small) wedding or birthday party. Of course, you can go out and scour the countryside around the estate, which spans eight hectares of hills, forests and paths to wander. However you can also stay quiet and warmup in the sauna or heated pool.",/en/food/
France will turn excess wine into industrial alcohol to combat surplus,    The world's second-largest wine producer is dealing with both overproduction and a drop in consumption. ,"France plans to spend millions of euros to turn wine into industrial alcohol for pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to drain a massive surplus, the Agriculture Ministry said on Monday, February 6.The world's second-largest wine producer after Italy, France has long been known as a nation of wine aficionados. But growers in the southwest region of Bordeaux say overproduction and a drop in domestic consumption of their more affordable brands have filled up their cellars and left them with nowhere to store the fruits of their next harvest.The Agriculture Ministry said that it would spend up to €160 million ($170 million) on distilling the tipple into industrial alcohol to use up some of the backlog.In Bordeaux, winemaker Didier Cousiney said the amount was only enough to help each small business for just a couple of months when spread across the industry nationwide.We have ""24 months' worth of backlog in our cellars,"" he said.Agriculture unions in the Bordeaux region, which have staged several protests, instead want compensation in exchange for uprooting part of their vineyards, a practice known as ""grubbing up"" the land. This would help reduce production and allow wine growers to repurpose the land for other activities.Cousiney and fellow growers estimate that at least 15,000 hectares (37,000 acres) of vineyards – an area equivalent to 21,000 football pitches – need to be grubbed up across the region to make a difference. They are requesting compensation of €10,000 per hectare.The government last sponsored distillation in 2020, after the worldwide Covid-19 lockdowns caused restaurants and bars to close down, and French wine exports to drop.Around half a million people are estimated to work in the wine industry in France, according to the National Interprofessional Wine Commission. If nothing is done, ""we fear between 100,000 and 150,000 jobs will be threatened in the coming decade,"" the commission's head, Bernard Farges, warned in December.Red wine sales in French supermarkets dropped 15% last year, according to the country's General Association for Wine Production. White and rose wine were less affected, registering declines of around 3% and 4%.Jerome Despey, a winegrower and secretary general of the FNSEA agriculture union, said this reflected a broader trend. French people used to drink around 130 liters of wine on average a year 70 years ago, he said, but today that has dropped to around 40 liters.",/en/food/
"Women and menopause: 'I realized that it could turn your life upside down, but no one was talking about it'","    With little or no information, many women find themselves at a loss when the first hot flashes arrive, almost by surprise. A fog persists around this pivotal moment in life, even though there are ways of getting through it better. ","When heat waves invaded Marthe's nights five years ago (some interviewees requested anonymity), no one warned her of the little living inferno she was about to enter, not to mention the fatigue, wrist and ankle pain, and weight gain that would follow. ""The doctor prescribed estrogen gel and progesterone capsules. It's a daily chore, constantly having to calculate when to take what. If you forget, the pain comes back with a vengeance. I felt like I was old and ugly before my time,"" explained this 51-year-old cultural executive in Paris.According to INSEE data for 2023, it is estimated that over 14 million women in France are affected by menopause. Every year, some 500,000 of them begin to experience it without being quite sure they can identify it. ""At first, I thought, with shame and irony, that I was pregnant,"" said 53-year-old Naïla, a teacher in Poitiers. Nearly one French woman in two feels that she is not sufficiently informed on the subject, according to a 2023 Essity study. Instead, she learns as she goes that menopause – the natural process that marks the cessation of ovarian function, and therefore the end of fertility – has arrived for good when menstruation has ceased for 12 months.""I thought I knew what to expect – the hot flashes, the intimate dryness, the low libido – but I never expected to be affected at the age of 44,"" confided Marie, now 45, a teacher in Lorraine. ""I've always been a dynamic person, but I feel like I had my battery removed. My brain is sluggish, it's hard to put two ideas together, my muscles are like cotton and my bones are made of lead. I feel like one of those old cassette players whose batteries were at the end of their life, with the music slowing down.""How do you cope with this ""second woman"" – mentioned by Gena Rowlands' character in John Cassavetes' Opening Night (1977) – when, just a few days earlier, you felt on top of the world, freed from the series of existential problems that had encumbered your 30s? ""It's like finding yourself facing eternity,"" said 44-year-old Louise, an architect in eastern France, who recently discovered the existence of the term ""perimenopause"": this pivotal period, which lasts an average of two to four years before menopause, can be accompanied by the so-called ""climacteric"" signs of aging.It's all a matter of bad timing. And suspense... It's Russian roulette: 87% of women experience at least one symptom in addition to the cessation of menstruation, 20% to 25% experience severe disorders (according to 2023 INSERM data), and it's commonly accepted that a third of them are not bothered too severely. Many women feel their way around menopause. For some, it's a ""bummer,"" an ""inner tsunami"" or  ""horrible;"" for others, it's a ""blessing,"" a ""mid-life liberation"" or a ""real joy,"" since they are happy to be out of their reproductive period. For some it's an ""awakening:"" ""I forced my body to change its paradigm and ignore all my aches and pains. I ran my first marathon at 55 and followed it up with six more,"" said 61-year-old Nathalie Si Amer enthusiastically, recently retired from teaching in the Paris region.",/en/global-issues/
Paris prosecutor opens investigation after Stars of David found tagged on buildings,"    Dozens of Stars of David were sprayed on buildings around the city and its suburbs, seen as threatening Jews amid the war between Israel and Hamas. ","Paris prosecutors opened an investigation on Tuesday, October 31, into 'some 60' Stars of David daubed on buildings in the 14th arrondissement of the capital, seen as threatening Jews amid the war between Israel and Hamas. The investigation for ""damage to other people's property aggravated by the fact that it was committed on the grounds of origin, race, ethnicity or religion"" has been entrusted to the Paris territorial police, the prosecutor's office said. This offense carries a maximum penalty of four years' imprisonment and a fine of €30,000.The prosecutor's office said it did not know ""whether these tags were intended to insult the Jewish people or to claim Jewish membership, particularly as they involved the blue star (not the yellow one)."" ""These stencils were marked on facades, in a way that was manifestly indifferent to what the buildings housed,"" says the public prosecutor. It has therefore not been established that this star has an anti-Semitic connotation, but this cannot be dismissed out of hand.""Earlier in the morning, the 14th arrondissement town hall had revealed that it had received ""several reports of stars of David stenciled on numerous walls"". ""This act of stenciling is reminiscent of the methods used in the 1930s and the Second World War, which led to the extermination of millions of Jews,"" wrote the municipality in a press release, denouncing ""anti-Semitic acts"". ""Anti-Semitism plastered on our streets as in the darkest hours"", also commented Carine Petit, the borough's mayor.Similar tags appeared last weekend in Paris suburbs including Vanves and Fontenay-aux-Roses (Hauts-de-Seine), as well as in Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen (Seine-Saint-Denis), where stencils were accompanied by inscriptions such as ""From the sea to the Jordan, Palestine will overcome"".""I firmly condemn these racist and anti-Semitic acts. The culprits must be arrested and judged with the utmost severity"", reacted the mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, on Monday. ""Anti-Semitism is a crime"", reiterated Aubervilliers Mayor Karine Franclet, who condemned the graffiti as ""despicable acts.""""On behalf of the government, I condemn these despicable acts with absolute firmness,"" reacted Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne at the French Assemblée Nationale on Tuesday. She said that ""to attack someone because they are Jewish (...) is to attack the very soul of the Republic"". ""It is the duty of the Republic to protect all the Jews of France"", she insisted, asserting that ""all those guilty of these acts must be questioned and condemned"" and that ""nothing can be tolerated, justified or excused.""Since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2,500 reports of anti-Semitic acts have been registered in France, according to the French Ministry of the Interior. On Sunday, the French Minister of Justice Eric Dupond-Moretti, reported more than 400 arrests for ""anti-Semitic acts.""",/en/global-issues/
Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi's message from behind bars,"    The activist and journalist expressed her 'sincere gratitude' to the Nobel Committee, lionized the 'non-violent and unstoppable' human rights movement in Iran, and concluded hopefully: 'Victory is not easy, but it is certain.' ","""Victory is not easy, but it is certain,"" imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize winner and women's rights activist Narges Mohammadi, said in a message smuggled out of her Tehran cell and published late on Tuesday, October 31.In the message, read out in French by her daughter, Kiana Rahmani, and posted on the official Nobel website, the 51-year-old activist and journalist expressed ""sincere gratitude"" to the Norwegian Nobel committee.Mohammadi – who was awarded the prize in early October ""for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran"" – once again criticized the requirement for women in Iran to wear a head scarf, and denounced Iranian authorities.""The compulsory hijab is a means of control and repression imposed on society and on which the continuation and survival of this authoritarian religious regime depends,"" she declared through her 17-year-old daughter, who has taken refuge in France along with her family. She condemned ""a regime that has institutionalized deprivation and poverty in society for 45 years,"" adding that it was ""built on lies, deception, cunning, and intimidation"".Arrested 13 times, sentenced five times to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes, and imprisoned again since 2021, Narges Mohammadi is one of the women spearheading the ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" uprising in Iran.The movement, which has seen women take off their headdresses, cut their hair, and demonstrate in the streets, was sparked by the death of a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, last year after she was arrested in Tehran for failing to comply with the strict Islamic dress code.On Saturday, Armita Garawand, a 17-year-old ethnic Kurd, died a week after she was declared ""brain dead"". She had been hospitalized since October 1 after falling unconscious on the metro. Rights groups have said the teen was critically wounded during an alleged assault by female members of Iran's morality police. The authorities dispute this account, saying she suddenly fell ill.""We, the people of Iran, demand democracy, freedom, human rights, and equality, and the Islamic Republic is the main obstacle in the way of realizing these national demands,"" Mohammadi said in her message. ""We[...] are struggling to transition away from this religious authoritarian regime through solidarity and drawing on the power of a non-violent and unstoppable process in order to revive the honor and pride of Iran and human dignity and prestige for its people,"" she continued in the message from Evin prison.""Victory is not easy, but it is certain,"" she concluded. It was not disclosed how the message was smuggled out.Kiana Rahmani, who read out the 10-minute message sent by Narges Mohammadi, and her twin brother Ali will represent their imprisoned mother at the award ceremony in Oslo on December 10, the Norwegian Nobel Institute announced Wednesday.The Peace Prize has on five occasions honored jailed activists, including last year's winner Ales Bialiatski of Belarus, whose prize was accepted by his wife, and Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo in 2010, whose chair remained empty.",/en/global-issues/
French wines and spirits set new export record,"    Overseas sales of champagne, cognac, Burgundy wine and other French spirits have exceeded the €17-billion mark for the first time ","Has the Covid crisis dissipated in fumes of alcohol? Whether it's champagne, cognac or wine, never before has the French trade balance done so well from the export of these home-grown products as it did in 2022. According to figures published on Tuesday, February 14, by the Federation of French Wine and Spirits Exporters (FEVS), the amount of French alcohol sold outside France has exceeded the historical record of €17 billion. This reflects a 10.8% increase from 2021, a year that had already seen a strong rebound after the bumpy ride caused by the global pandemic. The net balance reached €15.7 billion, up 10%, consolidating the wine and spirits sector's position as the second largest contributor to the balance of trade surplus after aeronautics.""The 2022 balance sheet is both momentous and surprising,"" said FEVS Chairman César Giron, who is pleased with this performance given the ""turbulent context and significant logistical limitations."" However, Giron does not deny that part of this growth in the value of exports is driven by inflation, which has soared worldwide. And he acknowledged that volumes sold have fallen by 3.8%. But he said he is satisfied to see that the growth is ""fairly evenly distributed between wines and spirits and across all geographical areas.""One particular driving force behind this stood out in 2022 and continues to do so, namely the American market. Exports of cognac, champagne, rosé from Provence and red wine from Burgundy jumped a further 14% to €4.7 billion across the Atlantic. The United States confirmed its position as the number one destination for French spirits, way ahead of the United Kingdom which, two years after Brexit, is still very fond of French beverages. Next in line are China, where growth was stopped short; Germany; and Singapore. The FEVS also points to new potential, particularly in Africa, which has seen exports to the continent increase by 21%, or €440 million.Among the most widely acclaimed alcoholic drinks, champagne was particularly popular in 2022. International trade in this sparkling wine increased by 20%, reaching a record level of €4.2 billion, with sales of 187 million bottles. This figure is also rising, enough to outpace cognac, which has seen a fall in the number of bottles sold despite a continuing increase in value, with a turnover of €3.9 billion.Cognac has been particularly affected by the slowdown in the Chinese market, where the zero-Covid strategy disrupted the daily lives of its inhabitants. This slowdown has also affected the Bordeaux vineyards, with China importing almost a quarter fewer bottles of French wine. The successive ups and downs of the Chinese market have weakened Bordeaux's wine industry, which is also seeing falling purchases in French supermarkets. The fall in exports of wine can be put down to commercial difficulties. Nothing of the sort for Burgundy, penalized by a poor harvest in 2021. But the Burgundy vintages continue to be snapped up, and the rise in prices has more than compensated for the poor availability of the vintage.",/en/food/
"A burger (vegetarian, or not) for lunch? Le Monde's 5 favorite Paris burger joints","    Thick, melting beef or a tasty chickpea patty grilled between two tempting buns: The burger is in the mix more than ever and is inspired by all countries. Now that the January detox is over, we can indulge ourselves, right? ","The first French fast-food restaurant was born in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris in 1961. It was the French version of the Wimpy chain, created in Chicago. Since then, the capital has seen a succession of trends and a parade of just about anything and everything between buns, since the burger is a mutable product. Popularized in France by McDonald's and Quick, it was the embodiment of junk food for a long time before being adopted first by bistros, then by the great French chefs at the beginning of the 21st century. Joël Robuchon and Eric Frechon dared to pair the American icon with foie gras. Alain Ducasse tried a big boudin burger and a more classic beef burger, coated with Bearnaise sauce.One would have thought that the Parisian history of the burger would end with this gourmet cultural appropriation. But a new generation of small establishments (Blend, Dumbo, Sold Out, Cuties Burger, Blossom Burgers) have decided to go back to the roots, taking their cue from American chains like Shake Shack, Five Guys and In-N-Out. Even better, some mad scientists are now daring unprecedented cultural mixes: Asian (at Shiso Burger), Peruvian (at APU) and African (at Bomaye).In our selection, we have tried to highlight these different facets of the fast food star. You can try them all if you feel like it... and if you have a strong stomach!At Dumbo, the cooks play patty-cake with the meat! The ball of matured ground beef, from the meticulous butcher Huguenin, is skilfully crushed on the cooking plate to form a thin patty. This is called smashing the meat. The advantage? When it is sufficiently fatty (as is the case here), it browns to become fabulously crispy. The rest of the formula? A Parisian potato bun (a brioche bun made from potatoes, designed by Bread Shop), homemade pickles, American cheese (a melted paste similar to cheddar), mustard and ketchup. This cheeseburger (€10) is the only reference on the menu, with a vegetarian version, the earth burger (€13), a little less convincing. The formula is minimal, the two locations too small to fit many in, and Dumbo, created in 2019, is now followed by very serious competitors (like Echo or Bikini). But it still remains a timeless HQ for street food lovers and ""the"" reference point for the smash burger in the capital. And bam!Lovers of XXL burgers, Goiko should become your canteen. This company born in Madrid quickly conquered Spain before offering its decadent delights in Paris. Here, one clearly does not come for the décor, lit with multicolored neon lights, nor for the slightly hesitant service (the staff is essentially Spanish-speaking), but for the unabashedly sumptuous and calorie-drenched burgers. The best-seller is called the Kevin Bacon (€13.50). You might laugh, but not for long, in front of a husky cook who mixes pieces of bacon directly on the grill into the minced beef (also from Spain). Layered atop this invigorating mixture, between ultra-moist and plump buns, you will find fried onions, cheddar cheese and... a little bit of whatever we want. The fast-food restaurant offers a little bit of everything: Mexican jalapeños, goat cheese, egg, candied tomato, or even extra red and white meat. But think twice before playing the mad scientist: The basic recipes are tasty and are more than enough to fill you up, or even to get you started on a good nap.This two-story establishment in the Beaupassage food court, with large photos of fathers and sons, is more than just another burger joint. Since Antoine's sudden death in a hit-and-run accident, his multi-starred father Yannick Alléno has turned it into a temple of transmission. But it's a gastronomic and joyful temple where street food and haute cuisine frolic together to create gourmet burgers. Here, the meat is from Normandy, the fried buns are prepared at the Pavillon Ledoyen (Alléno's parent company, near the Champs-Elysées) and the sauces are seasonal (the house mayonnaise is flavored with parsley in winter and with lovage in summer). As for the potatoes cut ""coin de rue” (“corner of the street,"" following irregular angles), perfectly crunchy and soft, electrified by paprika, we have rarely eaten such good ones. We recommend the house classics: Arsène (meat seasoned like a pepper steak, €15), Nikita (with the classic combo of cheddar and bacon, €17) and Lupin (vegetarian steak, beetroot, semolina, €14). Also try the ephemeral creations of chef Anisa Usmanova, who, for example, concocted a Japanese delicacy by marinating beef in soy and wrapping it in a shiso leaf.The name doesn't lie. These cutie burgers are really cute with their potato buns (ultra-chewy brioche buns) puffed up like cozy pillows. The owner, Nadji Taright, wanted to replicate the flavors of iconic American fast food chains like In-N-Out and Shake Shack. His little establishment stands out, with its resolutely modern, pastel and uncluttered décor, in the charming old France gallery of the Passage des Panoramas. At Cuties Burger, you can find small fat-rich beef steaks (120 grams), mayo, ketchup, lemonade... just like in the United States. Yes, but the meat is matured Montbéliarde and the lemonade is homemade, as are the sauces. The ketchup (the first one we taste with delight) is a mixture of crushed tomatoes, tarragon, mint, coriander and mustard seeds. In short, the venue has succeeded in combining American tradition with French savoir faire. A special mention goes to the veggie burger, whose steak, made of chickpeas and shiitake, is a mini-patty as crispy as it is tasty. Burger-side-drink option at €17.Purists, avert your eyes! The concept of this new venue on the Rue de Paradis, already full of restaurants, is to cross continents. The owners Camille Gozé and Laurent Kalala have traveled through North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa to devise their hybrid burgers (from €12.90), which are inspired by traditional recipes. The Lion de la Teranga, with its onions and lemon sauce, takes its inspiration from Senegalese yassa chicken. Babi la Douce, putting seared tuna in a homemade bun with plantain flour, draws on the Ivorian garba. Champion d'Afrique 2022 puts a mafé sauce (made of peanut paste) on a matured black angus steak. And, here, vegetarians are catered to thanks to the Allocovor, made with plantain hummus and yogurt and mint sauce. Of course, these ""ethnic"" burgers are very far from the originals, but they punch with their sumptuousness and boldly renew the palate.",/en/food/
Photographer Siamak Amiri portrays the bravery of the young women at the heart of protests in Iran,In pictures,"In 12 months, everything has changed in Iran. On September 16, 2022, a 22-year-old Iranian girl of Kurdish origin Mahsa Amini died while being held in police custody for wearing an ill-fitting headscarf. Her death sparked a protest movement that has since overturned the order imposed by the authorities. Of course, the regime's straitjacket is still as oppressive as ever. But, over the past year, women have dared to remove their headscarves, which have been compulsory in the country since the 1979 Islamic revolution. This act of emancipation is being increasingly supported by men, who now step in more often when women are harassed or intimidated. In a show of solidarity, some even go out into the street wearing shorts, which are also banned in Iran.At a time when the country's borders are still closed to foreign media, especially the print media, a series of photographs by Siamak Amiri takes on unprecedented importance. The series is titled ""Woman, Life, Freedom,"" from the rallying cry of the Iranian protest movement. All the pictures, which combine personal and journalistic approaches, were taken between March and August 2023. They show young women who took part in the demonstrations. As they smoke and chat with friends, the women wear their hair loose – sometimes even dyed – and sport metal band T-shirts or tattoos. In Iran, their apparent freedom demonstrates great courage and a will to fight.Some showed their faces to the lens, while others, for security reasons, turned their heads away. Most importantly, the photographer captured them in the public space – something he hadn't done during the protest for fear of police repression. He could never bring himself to photograph anything else than this streetlife. ""Life, audacity, resistance and the real fight were happening outside my door. Any ideas that crossed my mind for a project outside that framework seemed weak and meaningless,"" he said.The Iranian began his series once the demonstrations had been suppressed, at a time when ""the resistance had entered a new phase,"" he said. ""Even though a collapse of the current political system may not be on the agenda, we are in the midst of a social revolution,"" he added. Each photograph tells of one facet of the profound changes that are underway in Iranian society. There are bareheaded women who are ready to pay a high price for breaking the obligation to wear hijab, while others rise up against misogyny within their own families. Some parents finally show solidarity with their children who aspire to a freer life. These many new developments have reverberated beyond the capital Tehran, to other cities, including the most conservative, Isfahan, in the center of the country.",/en/m-le-mag/
'Best chef in the world' Guy Savoy stripped of Michelin star,    The 69-year-old has held Michelin's top three-star status since 2002 for his Monnaie de Paris restaurant overlooking the Seine. ,"The Michelin Guide announced on Monday, February 27, the shock decision to knock a star off the Paris restaurant of Guy Savoy, frequently named the best chef in the world.The 69-year-old has held Michelin's top three-star status since 2002 for his Monnaie de Paris restaurant overlooking the Seine, which has a sister version in Caesars Palace, Las Vegas.In November he was named best chef in the world for the sixth year running by La Liste, which aggregates thousands of reviews from around the world.Savoy's fame goes beyond the kitchen as an ambassador for the French ""art de vivre"" – he has pointedly rejected the fad for non-alcoholic drinks, for instance – and he lent his voice to the French version of the Pixar film Ratatouille.But that has not stopped Michelin from downgrading his establishment to two stars in its latest edition, published next Monday. It did the same for the upmarket seafood eatery of Christopher Coutanceau in La Rochelle.""These are exceptional restaurants, so you can imagine that these decisions are carefully considered, supported by numerous visits from our inspectors throughout the year,"" Gwendal Poullennec, head of the guide, told Agence France-Presse.The reasons are not made public and are communicated only to the chefs involved.""For such important decisions, we include not just French inspectors but also some from other countries,"" said Poullennec.The move to downgrade restaurants is always hugely controversial, especially since the suicide 20 years ago of Bernard Loiseau – a close friend of Savoy – after his restaurant lost a star. One chef, Marc Veyrat, unsuccessfully took the guide to court in 2019 after being stripped of a star and said he never again wanted to see a Michelin inspector in his restaurants.Around 20 French restaurants have also been downgraded from two to one star in the latest edition of the guide. It had not downgraded anyone since 2019, conscious of the difficulties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.Those difficulties have continued with restaurants facing staffing shortages and, in the last year, soaring prices. But the guide says downgrades are now necessary if it is to stay relevant.""Yes, there are challenges, but they are challenges for everyone,"" said Poullennec.Created in 1900 by tire manufacturers Andre and Edouard Michelin as a guide for motorists, it now has editions across Europe, Asia, North and South America.",/en/food/
"In France, food inflation continues to rise","    As negotations between manufacturers and retailers end tensely, consumers can brace for further price increases in grocery costs. ","A year ago, the subject of food inflation was beginning to stir up a debate. Manufacturers and distributors were negotiating average price increases of around 3.5%. Since then, prices on supermarket shelves have continued to increase, reaching as high as 14.5% in some rare instances. The inexorable rise in grocery prices has not ended – far from it. On Wednesday, March 1, discussions of 2023 rates held between manufacturers of consumer brand products and major chain stores ended tensely. And, with inflation expected to peak this spring, consumers will soon have to dig even deeper into their wallets.At the end of the negotiations, industry representatives shared their assessments of the situation. The prices paid by distributors to major brand manufacturers should increase by ""about 10%,"" said Jacques Creyssel, managing director of the French Federation of Commerce and Distribution (FCD). That figure was corroborated by Richard Panquiault, managing director of the Consumer Business Liaison Institute (ILEC), which represents major suppliers. He added that the average increase requested at the beginning of the negotiations was between 14% and 15%.Small businesses seem to have asked for less. ""We had formulated average rate increases of 10 to 11%, and we should reach 7 to 8%,"" said Léonard Prunier, president of the Federation of French Companies and Entrepreneurs (FEEF), an organization for small business suppliers of large retailers.The inflationary context furthered tensions in the discussions (which began on December 1, 2022), particularly between multinational corporations and large retailers. The heads of major chains were quick to criticize price proposals described as exaggerated or even ""delusional."" Putting Nestlé, Coca-Cola, Mondelez and Unilever in their sights was a way of dealing with consumers by warning them of an impending new wave of inflation.Though discussions usually come down to the final hours, the situation was more extreme this time around. ""The day before, [on] Tuesday, February 28, 40% of the contracts were not signed. Normally, that rate is more like 20%, or even 25%,"" said Panquiault. Jean-Philippe André, president of the National Association of Food Industries (ANIA) and head of Haribo, said, ""At noon on Wednesday, March 1, we had signed agreements with two major distribution networks out of five.""He wanted a 26% increase in the price of his candy. However, he believed that overall, at the stroke of midnight, ""95% of the contracts will be signed, as usual. But what matters is the quality of the signature."" In cases of deadlock, stakeholders can refer to a commercial relations mediator. ""This year, for the first time, the mediator has been called on as much by manufacturers as by distributors,"" said André.",/en/food/
"In Copenhagen, Noma is closing while Geranium is growing",Feature,"How do you define Danish gastronomy? Until recently, those interested in the subject would have answered 'Noma' without hesitation. Inaugurated in 2004, the three-Michelin-star restaurant in Copenhagen changed Denmark's image by promoting local ingredients. The country has gone from being the homeland of the frikadelle (meatball) to a major player in global gastronomy, capable of overshadowing France.Today, the definition seems to be about to change: In July 2022, Copenhagen's Geranium was named world's best restaurant in the 50 Best Restaurants ranking, a place long held by Noma. And in January 2023, the latter announced, to everyone's surprise, that it would close in 2024, a revolution in a small city with a high level of influence.Copenhagen has been dictating global trends in gastronomy for nearly two decades. Its rise began in the early 2000s, when Danish chef René Redzepi and restaurateur Claus Meyer came up with the idea of opening a restaurant that would showcase local produce – which no one had previously assumed could provide the raw material for a gourmet meal. ""Before, everything was imported. We showed that we could do incredible things without using foie gras, turbot or caviar,"" said Meyer (who is no longer associated with the restaurant).At Noma, the world discovered that berries, mushrooms, flowers and wild plants picked in the Danish forest tasted good, that fermenting and canning summer crops makes them last through the winter and that fish from the Baltic can compete with fish from the Mediterranean. Most of the celebrated products are recognizable on the plate: shrimp served live on ice, radishes buried in an edible soil of malt flour and hazelnuts and sorrel leaves sprinkled with a grasshopper-based powder.""From the beginning, Redzepi and Meyer gave their venture a political dimension by establishing a manifesto of new Nordic cuisine [seasonal and locavore], designed by several chefs,"" said Nicolas Chatenier, author of the book La Clé anglaise (""The Monkey Wrench""), which explores culinary geopolitics. This new Nordic cuisine has been financially supported since 2006 by the Nordic Council of Ministers, then by the Danish Tourism Board.Innovative and driven by Denmark's ambition to promote its culture, Noma drew the spotlight on Copenhagen and was soon emulated by others. Abroad, Peruvian and South African chefs were embracing the idea of using only local ingredients without importing anything. The locavore trend has affected all types of restaurants, from street food stalls to small bistros and large venues. ""[In Denmark,] many of us followed suit,"" said Nicolai Norregaard, chef at Kadeau, a locavore haute cuisine restaurant, which launched on the island of Bornholm, in 2007.",/en/food/
Paris' Ecole Ferrandi young cooks are ready to shake up the industry,"    A new generation of restaurant entrepreneurs is inspired by contemporary codes made of short circuits, social media and culinary identity. ","Gathered around a work surface, the young members of the brigade are receiving their final instructions. ""Be ready at 11:50 am sharp. I'd also like to see more respect for silence in the kitchen during service, it's important,"" briefs the chef for the day, Juliette Coignet, 20.In the kitchen and in the pastry corner, only students in their third year of training at the cooking school Ecole Ferrandi in Paris, are attending. That day, however, nearly sixty guests are waiting for them in the school's training restaurant.Entirely redesigned, from the decoration to the menu, it was renamed ""En soi,"" the name of the original concept imagined by the students of the class. This is the highlight of the ""culinary arts and entrepreneurship"" bachelor's degree program, which also exists in Rennes and Bordeaux. Students worked for several weeks on new restaurant concepts, formulated business plans and then brought them to life over the course of a few days.In this first concept, the students offer to rediscover spices, by giving center stage to the initial raw plant, often forgotten. Berries, bark, flowers... These dried plants, which give birth to colored powders, are featured at the restaurant's entrance and customers are invited to smell and touch them before tasting their dish.""We wanted to offer a complete sensory experience,"" said Barbara Mazaud, 22, who switched to the Bachelor's program at Ferrandi after two years of medical studies. ""This type of added value has become necessary to stand out: It's something we're reminded of for the day we want to start our own business.""This is what almost all students aspire to in the short or medium term. In addition to learning the fundamentals of cooking, courses in management, marketing and ""creativity"" are provided, with the idea of enabling students to develop their ""culinary identity.""""I often like to say that we train 'chef-chefs', who become chefs and company managers at the same time,"" said Christophe Haton, a ""Meilleur Ouvrier de France"" – a prestigious award in France which rewards special craftsmanship skills – who supervises the implementation of the students' business plans.However, the terms have changed in a few years. In the kitchens, students, smartphones in hand, film their preparations in close-up to post them on social media. They strive to stay abreast of culinary developments, ""trends"" as some students call them, that have become a fashion in their own right, a necessary step for those who, like many of them, imagine themselves to be part of the world of ""foodpreneurs,"" these new entrepreneurs of the restaurant industry.",/en/food/
"In France, frog legs are still going strong","The emblematic amphibian of French gastronomy has become increasingly rare. But the appetite for its delicate meat persists, as renowned chefs are putting it back on the menu.","In the beginning, the frogs, six in all, were curled up in a small cast iron pan. The protruding torsos and fleshy thighs, browned in olive oil and arranged in a ""Y"" shape, splashed for the last time in a pool of foaming butter delicately flavored with garlic. The dish arrived hot. As the waitress placed it on the table, we all heard a faint sizzling sound, like a dull, diffuse crackling, the result of the meat caramelizing. As the noise reached our ears, all I could hear was the song of crickets and the distant croaking of frogs – the original soundtrack of woods and thickets, of long summer nights in the countryside.We were seated at Allard's amidst white tablecloths, flowered tapestries and varnished woodwork with a time-worn patina. In this typical Parisian bistro, founded in 1932 and taken over by Alain Ducasse in 2013, frog legs, the jewel of French gastronomy, has never really left the menu. They hold a place of honor here alongside Burgundy snails, beef bourguignon, roasted salmon steaks and all those old culinary acquaintances the house has developed as specialties.But to me, frog legs seemed to belong to another category that day: one of the gastronomic experiences that summon the imagination and provoke a whole series of chain reactions. In the center of the plate, the amphibians' legs looked to me like dismantled puppet legs. ""After all, it's only a frog,"" I said to myself for encouragement, as I brought the first victim to my lips. Once in my mouth, the texture of the meat, both tender and lean, somewhere between that of poultry and freshwater fish, was hard to define. As I pulled the meat apart with my teeth, frog bones about the size of toothpicks piled up in the corner of my plate. The larger the pile, the more giant my hands became in proportion, and the more I felt like an ogre. Was this a restaurant or a Grimm Brothers fairy tale? I asked for my plate to be cleared quickly, so as to avoid seeing a young, dazed prince appear in it, like a remake of The Frog Prince flavored with parsley butter.In the fantasy world of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, young wizards sometimes sink their teeth into chocolate frogs that have the annoying habit of suddenly coming to life, leaping up and escaping from whoever tries to swallow them. In gastronomy, the reality is different. In an old episode of La Cuisine des mousquetaires posted on the INA YouTube account and entitled ""Les cuisses de grenouilles à la gasconne de Maïté,"" (Maïté's Gascon Frogs), the most well-known southwestern French chef on television explained how difficult this rare and expensive dish can be to prepare. ""To begin with, unfortunately, you'll have to manage to keep them still and peel them,"" she said, referring to the animals that she purchased alive and that were already difficult to find at the end of the 1990s.",/en/food/
Michelin 2023 awards: List of winners gives pride of place to French regions,"    One new three-star, four new two-stars, 39 newcomers to the ranking and 90 green stars distinguish an edition that also highlights some very young talents. ","After inviting itself to Cognac in 2022, this year's Michelin stars were awarded in Strasbourg on Monday, March 6, at the Palais de la Musique et des Congrès. More than 1,500 guests (French and foreign chefs and journalists) attended the event, which included a reception the day before with a folkloric flavor, hostesses in traditional costume and an enormous meal with sauerkraut and Munster cheese.The Michelin machine was determined to flex its muscles in the face of its rivals (Gault & Millau, 50 Best) and to continue to build on its provincial momentum, in order to raise the profile of the winners, the vast majority of which are located outside Paris. Out of 44 establishments receiving stars, 37 are situated outside of the capital, while due to a lack of means, or for convenience, critics and the press often remain focused on the French capital.Only one three-star restaurant was awarded this year, compared to two last year (Dimitri Droisneau and Arnaud Donckele): Alexandre Couillon, whose remote restaurant La Marine is based in Noirmoutier in the west of the country, had long been among the favorites for this promotion. Although the fish virtuoso is far from being an unknown, it is not certain that his rise will be enough to distract from the news of the stars that have been withdrawn from chefs who receive much more media coverage, notably Michel Sarran (who went from two to one star) and especially Guy Savoy, a monument who lost his third star (acquired in 2002).Four new two-star hotels, 39 newcomers: The number of establishments honored in this edition is slightly lower than in previous editions. The list of winners highlights some of the trends already identified in the guide. First of all, excluding the overseas territories (which unfortunately are not inspected), all of France is represented. ""The dynamics we are observing are even affecting regions that were previously under-represented, such as the Pays de la Loire and Hauts-de-France,"" observed the guide's director, Gwendal Poullennec. These starred chefs are defending the traditional terroir, but it is a terroir often jostled by exotic influences. At Rozó, in the northern department of Marcq-en-Barœul (whose star Le Monde predicted), herring can be found wriggling under a Korean chili pepper.Women remain poorly represented. Only one who works alone was awarded a star: Georgiana Viou, who creates Mediterranean plates with a hint of her native Benin at Rouge, in Nîmes. ""There is no discrimination, no quota, related to the gender of the chefs or any other criteria whatsoever,"" says Gwendal Poullennec. Our inspectors base their judgments on the quality of the establishment."" However, many couples working together have been highlighted. This is the case again at Rozó, where chef Diego Delbecq and pastry chef Camille Pailleau work in tandem. This is also true for the Strasbourg one-star restaurant led by the duo Jeanne Satori and David Degoursy.It is also possible to identify the rise of an ambitious young guard: Camille Saint-M'Leux, Thibaut Spiwack, Omar Dhiab, Mallory Gabsi and so on. Gabsi, a 26-year-old former ""Top Chef"" candidate, obtained a star (and the Michelin Young Chef Award) after less than a year of opening a Parisian restaurant in his name! The red guide has already been accused of succumbing to youthism. When Mory Sacko received his first star in 2021, at 28, the culinary journalist François-Régis Gaudry compared the guide to ""an old lady who walks with her walker and tries to chase after the trends"". Sometimes, the Michelin Man also arrives a bit late. Couillon was crowned ""cook of the year"" by Gault & Millau... in 2017.This list will not put an end to another recurring complaint: the opacity of the guide's choices. It is hard not to wonder, for example, how Pascal Barbot, who only reopened Astrance on December 31, could so quickly regain a star. And the green stars, which reward sustainable gastronomy (this year, 90 French restaurants were selected in total), lack clarity and visibility. No particular plaque is proposed to be placed on the distinguished restaurants.",/en/food/
How raclette became a cheery cheesy life philosophy,Nicolas Santolaria manages not to melt as he examines this meltingly friendly fromage dish that drips with positivity across the charcuterie board.,"We've all seen the videos of wood fires that are available on YouTube and other streaming platforms and give gas-heated city dwellers the soothing feeling of sitting before a crackling alpine fire. In a similarly anxiety-provoking vein, along with Patagonia fleece jackets and sessions on indoor rock-climbing walls, melted cheese has crept to the forefront of our dreamy lowland mountain lives. Delivery app Getir recently announced a 50% increase in raclette cheese orders on its site between October 2022 and January 2023 compared to the same period in 2021-2022. According to the same app, consumers started their orders two weeks earlier this year, beginning on October 24.But enjoying this convivial dish is not enough, it also has to be shared. This means the creamy goodness is flowing as much across our plates as it is on social networks where the cascade of melting cheese can be seen as entertainment in its own right, a sort of ""raclettetainment,"" if you pardon the French pun. Type ""raclette"" into the TikTok search bar, and you'll see how much the comforting dish has become event-driven: people celebrate the opening of the raclette season in pictures, document their first times as in a video entitled ""Tu fais découvrir la raclette à ton mari le blédard"" (""Introducing your hick of a husband to raclette), and organize the most unlikely challenges (having raclette during class, having a raclette on the subway, be careful for cheese lava flows).Generally, the message is that this shared meal exudes positivity. Raclette is an almost ideal form of sociability, a way of weaving cheese threads around the table, while each person sticks to their own tray. DJ Matafan, an up-and-coming artist from Savoie, the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region that celebrates this dish, has made a specialty of extolling the merits of what he considers a real panacea. In his video ""Magic Raclette,"" he says: ""When I feel unhappy, I eat raclette, when I feel so lonely, I eat raclette (...) and suddenly I have no more problems.""As an antidote to all our ills, raclette as a metaphor allows the visual transformation of something hard (a cheese, an era, a world) into something soft and comforting. But believing that this idea sprang up by itself would be a bit naive. In order to triumph in France as Camembert declines, the raclette industry is consciously using a Gramsci-like strategy, named after the Italian theorist of the early 20th century, who argued that any takeover of power (in this case over stomachs) should be preceded by a conquest in the cultural sphere.",/en/food/
Best pizza for lunch? Our five favorite addresses in Paris (and a bit beyond),"    Whether they offer Roman-style thin crust or Neapolitan-style with puffed edges, topped with burrata as big as an ostrich egg or Black Bigorre ham, our choices of pizzerias will brighten up your lunches (and dinners). ","Choosing the top pizzerias in Paris is a task as challenging as watching the 2006 France-Italy World Cup final with an Italian friend without fighting. Over the past decade, the quality of pizzas made in the capital has greatly improved. Professional ovens, high-quality ingredients, often imported, and extended fermentation processes are now the norm, leading to a new standard of excellence, directly influenced by Italian models. Gone are the days when one would sprinkle Gruyère cheese on their pizzas (yes, yes, horrified young people, that was once a thing that we did).While this selection may not include all of the fantastic pizzerias out there, some notable mentions are: Bonvivant Pizza (featuring organic flour dough that's light and easy to digest), Oxymore (using French ingredients), Da Vito (offering soft and fragrant pizzas thanks to a blend of white and wholemeal flours), Daroco and Chez Giorgio (serving perfectly crafted Neapolitan pizzas in stunning surroundings). This selection strives to bring together both new and established venues, blend Neapolitan (puffed crust) and Roman (thin crust) traditions, and offer a mix of both affordable options and indulgent treats. Buon appetito!The trend of Neapolitan pizzas has led to a neglect of Roman-style pizzas, which are often wrongly associated with the frozen horrors found in supermarkets. AVE Pizza Romana sets the record straight, serving up delicious thin-crust pizzas. Located in a charmingly dilapidated restaurant (featuring a concrete bar, stripped walls, and floor tiles), the highlight is the oven, situated in the center of the room and surrounded by an elegant oval counter. Service is prompt and prices are unbeatable (pizzas starting at just €6 during lunchtime from Tuesday to Friday).It's the pizza that truly stands out. Each pie is a large – more than 35 centimeters in diameter – thin-crusted delight, crispy at the edges and served on a plate. All of the ingredients, imported from Italy (with the exception of the yeast, as noted by pizza maker Anthony Di Mambro), stay true to the flavors of the home country. You won't find bacon here, but instead, guanciale in the carbonara pizza (€16). The cinque formaggi (€14) offers only cheeses ""made in Italy,"" including ricotta, mozzarella, taleggio, gorgonzola, and pecorino. A pizzeria worthy of Rome: top-notch.Watching Giuseppe Cutraro in action is a must to grasp why this 30-year-old Neapolitan chef has earned the title of world pizza champion multiple times. The former executive chef of the Big Mamma group now runs three locations in Paris and scoots from one to the next. He places a special emphasis on the dough, allowing it to ferment for over 24 hours for optimal hydration. The dough then undergoes a thermal shock of 390°C, resulting in a perfectly puffed crust with Neapolitan-style over-inflated and soft edges.At this Italian-style pizzeria, the majority of the products (including the waiters) are imported from Italy, featuring gorgonzola, mozzarella di bufala, cured meats, and of course, juicy tomatoes. Treat yourself to luxury toppings like the seasonal truffle-topped Queen Tartufo (€21). For a classic option, we recommend the simple Margherita (€12) to fully appreciate the tender, plump crust that's as enjoyable as a pastry.Dining at Gruppomimo feels like stepping into a Fellini film. The mini-chain turns every meal into a celebratory feast, with plenty of options for playful diners. The chunky arancini trio (truffle, bolognese, and cacio e pepe) served in a pot of creamy sauce and the pasta dishes made directly in a wheel of parmesan cheese are must-tries. The pizzas at Gruppomimo are generously sized, pushing the boundaries of Neapolitan fashion with the approval of Sicilian chef Pietro Rabboni, who is known for his expansive, over-inflated pizza crusts.Gruppomimo's rapid expansion is a testament to its generous offerings. Despite being a relatively new brand, having opened its first location in February 2021, it now boasts five locations in and around Paris. Although not necessarily renowned for its refinement, the menu at Gruppomimo offers dishes that are both visually and flavorfully pleasing, such as the basil devil pizza (€16). Topped with homemade basil pesto, juicy cherry tomatoes, and a dollop of creamy burratina in the center, the pizza is a feast for both the eyes and the taste buds. But, of course, this is not just about appearances, it is about deliciousness.The pizzeria located in the bustling Rue de Charonne boasts a unique blend of sophistication and creativity. With its refined Scandinavian-inspired decor and a drink menu focusing on sake, it offers an unexpected and daring twist to the traditional pizzeria experience. The toppings, which showcase ingredients like camembert and pastrami, are a testament to the restaurant's commitment to creativity and seasonality.The pizzeria, with its New York-inspired pies and creative toppings, has been attracting foodies for seven years on Rue de Charonne. Each month, a new ""pizza of the day"" is offered, pushing the limits of traditional toppings with unique and seasonal ingredients. The spicy honey pizza (€16) balances sweet and spicy flavors with chorizo and honey, while the cosmic ninja (€18) showcases a variety of mushrooms. Although the classic margherita is reasonably priced at €12, the notorious Bigorre (€21) with its premium black ham from Bigorre is a splurge-worthy treat. The audacious owner, Romane Gonzalez, has even contemplated adding a Hawaiian pizza to the menu.If you're looking for a true taste of Naples in Paris, look no further than this charming pizzeria in the 15th arrondissement. With its fresh ingredients, wood-fired cooking, and waiters sporting green-white-red accents, Chef Guillaume Grasso (a proud grandson of a pizza maker) has created a truly authentic dining experience. Despite its small size, the restaurant is a popular destination and early reservations are a must to secure your spot and savor its delicious offerings.At an incredible starting price of just €6, the cosacca is a must-try with its delectable tomato sauce that boasts a hint of acidity, Grana Padano cheese, fresh basil, and a drizzle of olive oil. Meanwhile, the classic pizzas, such as the one topped with anchovies and mozzarella di bufala, can be savored for just €10. For those looking to indulge, the most expensive offering on the menu is a creation made with premium bresaola and 24-month aged parmesan, priced at €18. The pizzas are baked to perfection in a wood-fired oven, resulting in a slightly puffed crust that is golden brown and infused with the aromatic scents of basil and oregano. Just a heads up, refrain from mentioning chili oil or tuna pizza to the owner as it might upset him.",/en/food/
"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: 'For good global health, let's eliminate trans fatty acids from the diet for good'","Trans fatty acids are responsible for 'bad cholesterol' and many cardiovascular diseases. Eliminating them would have a considerable health benefit, but it's urgent to involve public authorities and industry, explains the WHO director general.","Trans fat is a killer: Up to 500,000 people a year die worldwide from the consequences of eating it. Trans fat increases LDL (or ""bad"") cholesterol, the compound that clogs arteries and causes heart attacks and deaths from heart disease.Most trans fat comes from artificial, industrially-produced Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils (PHO), and is used in many baked foods, frying oils, fried foods and hardened fats, like margarine and vegetable ghee. They are cheap and increase the shelf life of processed food.But they have no known health benefit and can be readily replaced with other ingredients to preserve taste and consistency. They do nothing but harm our hearts; in essence, they are the tobacco of food products.And yet it would be so simple to eliminate them. PHO can easily be substituted with other vegetable oils that are healthier, no more expensive and taste good too, such as high-oleic vegetable oils.In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for the complete elimination of industrially-produced trans fat from the global food supply by the end of 2023. Since then, we have been supporting countries to implement policies prohibiting trans fat, and to replace it with healthier oils.There are two best-practice policy alternatives. The first is a national limit of 2 grams of industrially produced trans fat per 100 grams of total fat in all foods. The second is a national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils (a major source of trans fat).To date, more than 40 countries accounting for more than one-third of the world’s population had implemented one of the WHO’s best-practice policies on trans fat.A further 17 countries, with an additional 400 million people, are using less restrictive policies, but are still on a good path toward implementing the WHO’s package of recommended best practices.This is remarkable progress, with an almost six-fold increase in the number of people protected by best-practice policies since the launch of the initiative. The results are clear. In Denmark, the first country to eliminate trans fat, studies show that after the introduction of the regulation in 2004, there was a decrease in mortality from heart disease.However, time is of the essence if we are to achieve the goal of complete elimination by the year 2023.Many nations are heading in the right direction. For example, the United States has passed a law banning the production and use of PHO in its food supply.",/en/food/
"Fried chicken, hot wings and chicken waffles, 'soul food' coming to Paris from the South of the US","Forget about KFC's oil-soaked chicken drumsticks. For 15 years, another kind of tasty, more authentic fried chicken has been bringing 'soul food' to France.","I remember very well the first time I bit into a piece of fried chicken. It was in the early 2000s, I was still a teenager and the Unites States' fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), which was then expanding all over France, had just opened a franchise in the small town where I lived. The restaurant – a large gray concrete cube with the red, white and black logo of the brand – was located in the middle of nowhere, on the outskirts of an industrial zone.The bus dropped me off at one of those anonymous stops on the edge of a ring road and, with a determined effort, I walked the two kilometers to the restaurant, clutching the promotional coupon I had cut out of the local newspaper a few hours earlier. ""5 Hot Wings bought = 5 free"": Surely, it had to be worth it, I told myself, still wondering what had made me put so much effort to go out and taste 10 pieces of oil-soaked poultry. Perhaps it was the appeal of novelty? The suggestive power of a well-executed marketing operation?Looking back, I know now that I was looking for something else. I wanted to go eat at KFC like I would go see a blockbuster at the movies or like I would wear a pair of Nike sneakers or display a Michael Jordan poster in my room: To treat myself to a dose of Yankee exoticism, a little slice of the American lifestyle.Once there, I finally got my hands on the Hot Wings. In this case, a cardboard box stained with grease, in which lay an assortment of drumsticks and chicken wings. They had been seasoned with a mixture of herbs and spices, then coated with a thick layer of breadcrumbs before being briefly cooked and deep fried. An unpleasant smell of grease instantly seized my nostrils, it stuck to my fingers and embedded itself in my clothes. But strangely, that day, I enjoyed filling my mouth with fat, feeling the skin crisp under my teeth and sucking the wings to the bone. In this unappetizing junk food dish, I found a form of guilty pleasure, the taste of which would live in me from then on as a strong gustatory memory.More than fifteen years later, I met another kind of fried chicken, less heavy, tastier and above all, more authentic. I was writing an article for Le Monde's magazine on the origins of ""soul food"" and I had gone to meet the few Parisian chefs who claimed it. Alongside mac and cheese, cornbread and black-eyed peas, one of the main dishes of this ""soul food"" originating from the South of the US, which constitutes the culinary heritage of African-Americans, is fried chicken.",/en/food/
"Alexandre Couillon, the only French chef to win the coveted three Michelin stars","    After a difficult start, the chef has made his isolated restaurant La Marine a destination thanks to a highly personal cuisine that gives pride of place to products from the sea and his vegetable garden. ","In a year that has been notably sparse in awards, Alexandre Couillon is the chosen one, the only chef to win the three-star award in the Michelin Guide France 2023. Couillon's name was not among those that were circulating – perhaps because of his remote location. His restaurant, La Marine, is located at the extreme tip of the Noirmoutier peninsula (a French island in the Bay of Biscay, connected to the mainland by the Passage du Gois causeway), facing the Atlantic Ocean and far from the gastronomic trails.Couillon's story is not one of overwhelming culinary ambition. An unsettled student, he was sent in the direction of cooking because he needed something to keep his ten fingers busy and because there was a hotel school in Noirmoutier. If he ended up settling there with his wife Céline in the family restaurant facing the harbor in 1999, at only 24 years old, it was at the request of his parents, natives of the island. His mother, a seamstress, and his father, a shrimp fisherman, had become restaurateurs at a late age and urged their son to take over the business they had bought 15 years earlier, thwarting his plans. At the time, Couillon was working with acclaimed French chef Michel Guérard, one of the founders of nouvelle cuisine. He had planned to perfect his skills by working at Alain Ducasse's restaurant and Joël  Robuchon's before setting off on his own.The beginning was difficult. ""From the end of September to June, Noirmoutier was like the Gobi desert,"" recalled the now 47-year-old chef. Obliged to open seven days a week and to have 80 covers to compensate for the vagaries of the frequentation, he chose a ""simple and traditional cuisine, without worrying too much about the produce. With Céline, we were young, carefree, insolent, we wanted to prove that we were capable of doing it,"" he analyzed.The birth of their first daughter in 2002 left the chef feeling disorganized, especially when she reached talking age and declared, ""Daddy always work."" His frustration was reinforced by a conversation with a fisherman in the harbor across from the restaurant from whom he wanted to buy fish. The fisherman laughed in his face: ""It's too expensive for you! This goes to Paris!""In 2007, Alexandre and Céline had finished paying back the restaurant's loan and were thinking of shutting up shop. But Michelin had other ideas. ""We were in the car, discussing closing when we heard on [local radio station] Alouette that La Marine had earned a star."" That distinction changed everything, ensuring an increase and regularity in patronage, especially in the region.",/en/food/
"Paris, capital of gastronomy: A journey through French cuisine at the Conciergerie Museum","    From royal banquets to heads of state lunches and bouillons to brasseries, the exhibition goes back over eight centuries of French culinary art from the Middle Ages to the present day. ","In people’s minds, the Conciergerie de Paris remains the last home of Marie-Antoinette before the guillotine. This former prison, which suffered greatly from the lack of foreign visitors during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, is trying to change its image by organizing exhibitions capable of arousing the interest of not only tourists but also Parisians. This is evidenced by its newest exhibition: ""Paris, capital of gastronomy, from the Middle Ages to today.""Behind the boastful title, the aim is to show the plural role of Paris, both as a melting pot where gastronomy was structured and developed and as a place of power where cuisine takes on challenges that go far beyond the pleasure of good food. This is evident as soon as you step into the impressive Salle des Gens d’Armes – the largest non-religious Gothic hall in Europe – which hosts the exhibition. It begins with the banquet held by King Charles V of France in honor of the Germanic Roman Emperor on January 6, 1378. The plethoric and poetic menu is preserved between a fragment of an engraved marble table and a small selection of period tableware borrowed from the Louvre Museum. It includes ""stuffed and gilded rabbits,"" ""eels sweetened with mud"" and ""stuffed figs covered with gold leaves.""""There is a tendency to think that French gastronomy started in the 17th century, or even with Escoffier, at the end of the 19th century,"" said Loïc Bienassis, historian at the European Institute of History and Cultures of Food and co-curator of the exhibition. ""It is actually a much older story."" It includes the feast offered by the Parisian municipal authorities to Queen Catherine de Medici in 1549 and the reception at City Hall to celebrate the recovery of Louis XIV after a serious illness in 1687. It is followed by a journey through the table of the powerful, which leads to 2015, the lunch of heads of state at COP21, chaired by François Hollande, where the menu draws its inspiration from multiple regions: scallops from Normandy, Licques in the Pas-de-Calais poultry, Reblochon from Savoie, Corsican citrus fruit from Paris-Brest.""The discourse around the richness of France’s provinces has always existed, but for a very long time, it was in Paris that these riches were transcended by political and economic elites. French political centralism can be found in French cuisine,"" said Loïc Bienassis, for whom there is a real historical legitimacy in speaking of Paris as a ""gastronomic capital."" In the exhibition, this Parisian hegemony can be seen through several narrative threads: Paris is not only the city that receives prestigious guests, but also a laboratory where the concept of the restaurant was born, ""the great invention that tipped gastronomy into modernity in the mid-1800s"", summarized Cécile Rives, administrator of the Conciergerie.",/en/food/
"In central France, an African restaurant is cherished by its customers but angers its neighbors","Appreciated by the regulars of Gnama Cissé's restaurant, the smells of her kitchen inconvenience the landlords of the apartments located above, who have taken the chef to court.","In Poitiers, central France, Gnama Cissé cooks an attiéké – a dish made from cassava semolina – that is to die for. Cheese samosas, shrimp fritters, sweet potato fries, cod acras, chicken with mafé sauce, and Yassa-style fish complete the menu of her small African and Caribbean restaurant, located in the city center. An exhilarating aroma tickles the noses of the customers as soon as they enter Chez Gnama. However, the smell is not to everyone's liking.The owners of the three apartments located above the establishment took the restaurant owner to court at the end of 2022, claiming that cooking odors were spreading freely in the building, making it impossible to rent or resell the vacant apartments. In a rare move, the interim judge and his clerk visited the building in mid-January to ""smell"" the apartments. On Wednesday, March 1, the court rejected the plaintiffs' request to close the restaurant on Rue du Moulin-à-Vent.Cissé has good reason to feel ""relieved."" Opened at the end of 2020, her four-table restaurant is the culmination of her life, which began in Guinea 33 years ago. Before opening her restaurant, the young woman roamed the markets of Poitiers and the surrounding area in a van, selling African specialties. ""When are you going to open your own restaurant?,"" her regular customers asked her. Cissé then invested ""all her savings"" in this ground-floor establishment on the edge of the pedestrian district. The first letters arrived fairly quickly asking her to stop embalming the building with her ""exotic cuisine."" ""That was the beginning of a real harassment, almost racist,"" she said. ""Whether there are odors or not, what is the problem with the 'exotic' nature of my cuisine?""To ease the conflict, the restaurateur replaced her hood with a custom-made model costing €4,000. She had the air duct lined by the owner of her storefront. She even removed ""long simmering sauces"" from her menu in order to restrict the volume of scents. At the same time, a petition was launched online by loyal customers: more than 1,500 signatories expresssed their support for this mother of three with a ""long history of fighting.""Cissé arrived in France at the age of 15 with a baby and was taken in by the child welfare system. Her studies in the social and family economy sector (BTS, state diploma) then opened the doors of a neighborhood house in Poitiers, but the experience of ""referent"" – a role as a support for residents and their projects – did not lead to a job. The young woman then remembered that her Guinean cooking was appreciated by her host family. She also remembered her grandmother's recipes in the small town of Kindia: ""She taught me everything. In Africa, you can cook from the age of 10.""",/en/food/

French cognac is flowing in American rap music,Investigation,"""I have a story for you. And not just a story but a part of our history. What is the link between the land of cognac, jazz, blues and hip hop?"" The voice-over pauses while a video shows a van moving bumpily through vineyards. On board is a cluster of Black American soldiers, all of them wearing military uniforms, with grim looks on their faces. The singer Usher (one of the top-selling artists in the early 2000s) is among them. He is also the narrator of this surprising promotional clip for the cognac brand Rémy Martin.The video, uploaded to YouTube in 2021, lasts six minutes. The visual production is reminiscent of a Hollywood blockbuster and it features the American star delivering a crash course in history between dance moves. Usher tells how the American troops who landed in France in 1917 fell in love with cognac, brought it back home and remained faithful to it from one generation to the next. ""From this gathering [between the French and Americans], something almost magical happened,"" says Usher with a broad smile. ""Each culture inspired the other.""The story he tells may be somewhat simplified, but it is nevertheless true. The brown spirit was indeed embraced on a massive scale by GIs who fought in France during the first and second world wars. ""We know Hennessy cognac was present much earlier on American soil, as early as 1794,"" explained Fabienne Moreau, the historian in charge of the brand's heritage. ""But when they came to France, the soldiers discovered a country where racial equality was institutionalized. Black jazzmen could play freely in the clubs. Cognac ended up embodying these values of equality and freedom. And it became a marker of identity: It is the anti-whisky, which was seen as the alcohol of White people.""Cognac's historical roots in the Afro-American community have benefited from an unexpected development. Since the 1990s, rappers across the Atlantic have become the most powerful advocates for this traditional alcohol from Charente, in southwestern France.The hushed world of spirits and the boisterous world of hip-hop came together for a somewhat unconventional love affair that has played a major role in cognac's revival. The United States is the leading market for this French product, an unparalleled 97% of which is sold abroad. In the US, 111.3 million bottles were sold in 2022, over half of the exports and three times more than China, its second-largest importer. Rappers have played an important role in this American triumph.",/en/food/
"Maxime Frédéric, an exceptional pastry chef",Profile,"Lined up with preciosity under glass cloches, Louis Vuitton eclairs, meringue tarts with checkerboard patterns reminiscent of the trunks, and chocolate desserts decorated with the famous monogram attract an eclectic crowd every day on the second floor of LV Dream. The Parisian exhibition space was opened by the luxury house in December 2022 on the Pont-Neuf, in place of the former Conforama store.There is nothing radically new in this concept of a café-chocolate shop launched by a fashion brand. Armani, Prada and Ralph Lauren already tried it several years ago. The view of the Seine and the iconic saffron-colored boxes that hold the delicacies are sure to delight the eye. But the signature of pastry chef Maxime Frédéric, displayed in large letters above the display case on a background of white tropical foliage, has generated a frenzy.At just 33 years old, the Normandy native, named best pastry chef of the year in 2022 by the Gault & Millau guide, is now head pastry chef of the three restaurants at the Cheval Blanc, the luxury hotel into which LVMH has transformed the floors of the Samaritaine. His millefeuille, which took him nearly two years to design, won the Madeleine prize from the jury at the Fou de Pâtisserie awards. ""We've already tasted thousands of millefeuilles,"" commented Julie Mathieu, editor-in-chief of Fou de Pâtisserie magazine. ""This one, however, managed to surprise us and today embodies the most accomplished expression of French patisserie.""Reinterpreting the classics, the prodigy is known more for his obsession with taste than his concern for appearances. On his 145,000-subscriber Instagram account, there are no viral videos of dough kneading and joyful glazing set to a musical backdrop, the trademark of pastry chef Cédric Grolet. Maxime Frédéric, whose sense of teamwork is emphasized by everyone, prefers to highlight his team, and the intricate detailing of his rocking horse-shaped Christmas yule log evokes more the aesthetics of savoir-faire and excellence than that of TikTok.Maxime Frédéric is a man of the soil and proudly showcases his Normandy heritage. Since harnessing his countryman's sense and focusing on a reinterpreted rusticity – rice pudding appears as a mignardise on the menu at Plénitude, the three-starred restaurant of chef Arnaud Donckele at the Cheval Blanc – his fame has soared. The pastry chef even dreams of cultivating the land on his own farm.In the meantime, with his sister, Noémie, and his partner, Claire, he has revitalized his grandparents' farm in Tourville-sur-Sienne (Manche, Normandy), with hazelnut production and heritage chicken farming. Their exceptional eggs supply the kitchens of Cheval Blanc and those of other chefs, such as Bernard Pacaud, of L'Ambroisie, and Jean-François Piège, who uses them for the blancmange, the floating island he has reworked at the Grand Restaurant.",/en/food/
'Drops of God': The intoxicating manga that rocked the world of wine,"    Launched nearly 20 years ago, the Japanese saga is coming to Apple TV+ as a mini-series on April 21. It has changed the way we talk about wine and even affected the destiny of certain wineries. ","Just like droplets that flow together to create vast rivers, Drops of God, a Japanese manga imagined by a brother and sister some 20 years ago, to present the wines they tasted, became a 44-volume saga and a worldwide triumph. It also changed the destiny of several wineries along the way. Now they are being adapted for TV as a French miniseries, available on video-on-demand on Apple TV+ starting April 21.The work is a true ode to the nectar of the vine. This, for example, is how a Chevalier-Montrachet, 2000 vintage, from Michel Colin-Deléger, is described in volume 18 of Drops of God: ""There is an austerity to this wine that doesn't let those who treat it imprudently approach it. But despite... no, precisely because of this, we cannot help but feel immeasurable expectations. Because at the summit that bliss that will never disappoint us inevitably awaits. An all-embracing emotion – fear, despair, sorrow – which draws us up towards joy, is certainly waiting for us there. The essence of this wine is the 'test.' And what we can only taste when we have mastered it, an immense sense of accomplishment.""The manga, published in France between 2008 and 2016 by Glénat, evoked some 700 wines over 439 episodes. All of them are described in a vivid, poetic manner, immersing the reader in a unique world for each label tasted (in the case of the Chevalier-Montrachet, the ascent of the Matterhorn Mountain accompanies the description). Most of the wines are French, but there are also Italian, Spanish, Californian, Australian and Japanese vintages. The pair of writers – who sign under the pseudonym Tadashi Agi – tasted all the wines in order to translate them into words, before the artist Shu Okimoto herself would get involved.And so, a comic book intended primarily for well-versed readers has become a colossal success in France, with 1.4 million copies sold. 15 million were sold worldwide. It also marks a turning point: ""Drops of God opened the door for seinen in France, the manga for young adults,"" said Satoko Inaba, editorial director of Glénat Manga. ""Until then, this literary genre had been wrongly associated with a teenage audience, with action stories, often violent.""Above all, no book had dared tackle wine with such proud lyricism. ""Fiction in France tends to focus on the storyline, whereas manga is based on the characters and their emotions, shared with the reader,"" said the Glénat publisher. ""It is therefore an excellent medium to talk about wine. And since the essence of manga is also to popularize, to reach the widest audience, we learn a lot when reading Drops of God. But it's also dangerous, because after reading it, all you want to do is go drink wine!""",/en/food/
"Tony Parker talks wine: 'I've always loved rosé – for me, it's associated with memories of vacations'","    The former NBA star owns his own vineyard in Provence, and now he's invested in the Château La Mascaronne to create a high-quality rosé. ","Tony Parker is regarded as the greatest French basketball player of all time. From 2001 to 2018, he played for the San Antonio Spurs in Texas and won four NBA championships, being named the Most Valuable Player at the 2007 finals. The 40-year-old point guard will be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in August, cementing his legacy in the game.Parker has told his story in a book, Beyond All Of My Dreams (Solar/L'Equipe, 2019), and in the documentary Tony Parker: The Final Shot, which was aired on Netflix in 2020. Born in Bruges to an American basketball player father and a Dutch model mother, Parker held his first basketball at the age of three. He led the French national team to victory in the 2013 European Championships. He has been the president of the ASVEL Lyon-Villeurbanne basketball club since 2014 and is the founder of the Tony Parker Adéquat Academy in Lyon, and, as of this year, an Adidas ambassador. He has also recently expanded his business ventures in the wine industry, investing in Château La Mascaronne to create a high-quality rosé.I consider myself lucky because 1982 was a fantastic vintage for wine. Whenever I visit a Bordeaux château, I request a bottle from that year, and I've been fortunate enough to sample many of the best wines from 1982. The Château Angelus 1982 from Saint-Émilion is a standout – it has aged beautifully and I loved everything about it. The Château Cos d'Estournel 1982 from Saint-Estèphe was also incredible. And then, there's the legendary Pétrus 1982 from Pomerol. I'm thrilled to have some of these exceptional wines in my own cellar.I'm an avid wine drinker, but I don't collect bottles – I purchase them to enjoy. I have 1,500 bottles to share with friends; I consider myself a lover of the good life. In France, we're fortunate to have access to exceptional wine, and I take advantage of that. I celebrate every major achievement in my basketball career with a bottle of wine – often great Bordeaux wines, which are my favorite. I'm also learning to appreciate Burgundies and wines from the Provence region. However, if I had to choose, Bordeaux would be my top pick.I've been offered opportunities to invest in wine in California but for me, wine is primarily associated with France. It's a reference point, I don't want to disrespect the Spanish, Italian, or Californian winemakers. Perhaps that's a bit discriminatory of me.",/en/food/
Taiwan and the fusion of world cuisine,"The island's cuisine offers a rich palette of flavors, textures and dishes with roots in the Netherlands, Japan and, of course, China. It makes for a delightful experience.","Until now, I didn't know anything about Taiwanese cuisine. Nada, walou. I just knew where to stick a pin on a map for the country: a large island in East Asia, roughly four times the size of Corsica, located off the coast of China, north of the Philippines and south of Japan. And then, one sleepless night, it unexpectedly offered itself up to me in a way that was as delicious as it was direct. It was one o'clock in the morning, my eyelids were heavy, my stomach was empty and I'd just started replaying Eat Drink Man Woman on the Arte website. This third film by famous Taiwanese director Ang Lee was released in 1994 and nominated the following year for the Oscar for best foreign language film.The opening scene completely drew me in and I'm still salivating over it to this day. It's daytime and the camera has entered the kitchen of an elderly man wearing an apron, his sleeves rolled up. For six long minutes, we watch as he prepares a meal, the lens zooming in on his skilled hands, examining his every move. In the middle of a tiled wall, the movements of various utensils (ladles, a colander, bamboo baskets, an enormous array of sharp knives) above a wok gradually allow us to hear the sizzling sound of ingredients cooking. For a moment, the smell of cooking seems to pass right through the screen and into my nose. The color of the food changes before my very eyes and I can almost imagine what its texture feels like. In fact, I am witnessing the creation of several typical Taiwanese dishes as if I were right there in the same room instead of on the other side of the screen. And at this late hour of the night nothing can make me want to start cooking more.To achieve this masterful sequence, which required more than a week of shooting, Lee used three professional chefs. The main actor, Sihung Lung, had to be trained how to use the utensils. The film begins like this: A pair of hands immersed in a fish tank catches a fish. Using a pair of chopsticks, the chef immobilizes the animal and then guts it on a block. After lifting out the fillets, he crisscrosses the flesh with a knife. Once floured, the fish is transformed by being dunked into a bath of boiling oil, before being returned to room temperature. The man then removes two beautiful pieces of pork belly from a dark marinade, fries them and puts them in a bowl filled with ice cubes. He delicately slices several thin, juicy-looking strips of meat and puts them in the bottom of a bowl with spring onions, sugar and star anise. A few seconds later, the concoction disappears underneath the lid of a large, steaming basket. The cook then goes to his yard in search of a chicken. After an interval, the chicken has been plucked and is ready to simmer inside a terracotta pot, in a broth that we can assume is thick and intensely flavorful.",/en/food/
From car trunks to supermarket trolleys: the real street food of Paris,"    Street food might be taking over restaurant menus, but the real thing, sold for a pittance from makeshift facilities, is an underground economy that allows immigrants to survive. ","The Sunday afternoon Spanish-language mass had barely finished at this Paris church, when a car pulled up at the edge of the square. A couple got out and opened the trunk, which was filled with interesting things to eat like empanadas (savory pasties, filled with meat and vegetables) and pan de queso (cheese bread).As the congregation left mass, a line formed behind the vehicle to pick up a cafecito (""small coffee"") and a pasteleria (""pastry"") to enjoy there, as well as food to take home. Everyone knew each other and gathered around the couple; Diana and Nelson (their first names have been changed), Colombians in their fifties. Like many of their customers, they left Colombia for Spain in the 2000s to find a better life. But the 2008 financial crisis hit their host country hard. They resettled in Paris in 2012. They began selling their homemade dishes outside the churches attended by their compatriots, as well as making home deliveries.While most of the customers are Colombian, there are also Peruvians, Ecuadorians, and a few French people. ""We're loyal to them because it's food we don't see here. But it's also a way to build a community with Latinos. By buying their food, we're supporting them,"" said 39-year-old Carmen. We took a first bite of a pan de queso, designed to be eaten on the go, on the street or at home. We'd buy more, but to our frustration the crates were empty within 20 minutes. A new customer arrived. Nelson struck up conversation: ""We've run out! Where are you from?"" The young man replied proudly that he was Venezuelan.Diana and Nelson work underground. In France, itinerant sales – known as au déballage – are prohibited, and incur a penalty of €15,000 (Article L. 310-5 of the Commercial Code). Along with many other street vendors in major French cities, they are representatives of an authentic street food culture, directly imported from countries where setting up a wobbly stall on a street corner or roadside is tradition. This is the case in all the Latin American countries, as well as those of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, for instance.In the Paris neighborhood of Belleville, elderly ladies sat and opened their carts filled with sauces, peanuts and dumplings outside the specialist Asian food outlet, Paris Store. First-generation immigrants, these Chinese women do not speak French and trade in their native language. Outside the metro exit, Chinese customers come to pick up their bag of dumplings for €10. ""This is the first point of entry into the labor market when these casual workers arrive in a metropolis. They depend on the street economy,"" said geographer and urbanist Jérôme Monnet, an expert in the uses of public space.",/en/food/

Israel has become a new promised land for winegrowers,"    Since 2000, Israeli wine production has experienced strong growth and moved upmarket. In 2022, the creation of its first appellation, Judean Hills, was a crowning moment for producers in search of their own identity. ","The history of Israeli wine is very old but chaotic, with long stretches of inactivity and a few rebirths linked to its complicated past and the successive conflicts of recent decades. Like in neighboring Lebanon, traces of wine production can be found well before our era, including vestiges of over 2,000-year-old wine presses, but vines laid dormant for centuries following Islam's arrival in Palestine. Only in the second half of the 19th century did the wine industry begin to structure itself with the support of Baron James de Rothschild (1792-1868), but this momentum was quickly destroyed by phylloxera. In the 1950s, the sector rebounded when European winegrowers settled and built a few large wine-growing entities. The final stage began with the creation of small estates, first at the end of the 1980s and then especially at the turn of the millennium, which breathed new life into the industry.This history has led to a contrasting viticultural landscape, with on one side a ""big five"" – Carmel, Barkan, Golan Heights, Teperberg and Binyamina – accounting for 80% of all production, and on the other some 300 wineries, many of which were created just 20 or 30 years ago. Production is in line with the scale of a country twice the size of the Ile-de-France region: 8,000 hectares and 40 million bottles per year – by comparison, France produces well over a hundred times more.Vineyards have fled the hot plains and their dry soils for the hills at higher altitudes to seek cooler temperatures. Most of them are located in northern Israel near the Lebanese border, where the Galilee highlands are swept by the breezes from Mount Hermon. Not far away, the Golan Heights and its water-rich mountains are home to a few hundred hectares of plantations. A handful of estates are also present in the southern Negev region, at least where the land lies between 500 and 1,000 meters above sea level. In 2022, they applied for an appellation to have their wines' uniqueness recognized.And then there is Judea. Here, in the hills of Jerusalem in central Israel, is where the country's wine renaissance is happening. As a symbol, its producers obtained in August 2020 the country's first official appellation, Judean Hills, produced by passionate winemakers heading small private wineries, some of which have gained worldwide notoriety.One of the pioneers of this revival is Eli Ben Zaken, the bright-eyed, white-haired and patriarchal-bearded figurehead of the Judean wine industry with his Domaine du Castel, located on a hill near Jerusalem. In a book released in February, Domaine du Castel. The Biography, journalist Adam S. Montefiore tells the story of this winemaker and his estate that have contributed to spreading Israeli wine's recognition beyond its borders.",/en/food/
"After K-pop, K-food is conquering France","    With its decorated dalgona candy and its kimbap rice and vegetable rolls, Korean food is making is becoming a fixture. ","Walking through the door of the Kick Café in the center of Paris, one gets the feeling of entering a gigantic box of sweets. Candy pink walls, white chocolate pastries disguised as lollipops, shortbreads shaped like teddy bears, blue, green, purple cocktails topped with whipped cream, cookie powder and cotton candy syrup. It's an accumulation of glucose that would make Hansel and Gretel's gingerbread house jealous. The boutique café is the headquarters of K-pop fans. Moreover, at the back of the room, near cardboard silhouettes of stars, groupies in their twenties were blowing up balloons while munching on sesame cakes, currently the trend in Seoul. Their favorite band, CIX, was due to play at the Bataclan the next day. And it is here that music lovers from Orléans, Lille or Metz have chosen to meet to celebrate the event.Singers and fans are not the only ones to stop by the Kick Café. A little over a year ago, the establishment welcomed Korean Culture Minister, Hwang Hee, who came to meet French K-pop fans. ""I feel very supported by the country's institutions,"" said the café's founder, Savannah Truong, 28, with a broad smile. She is assisted by the Korean Cultural Center, the embassy, Kocca (the agency for the promotion of trade and investment), and Kotra (the agency for creative content). ""In November 2022, Kotra even paid for my trip to Seoul to learn about local coffees and products I could import."" After publishing a book about her homemade cocktails, K-pop Drinks (Hachette, 2022), the young boss feels supported enough to open another café in London this year. ""I want to open 10 around the world!"" she said without blinking.In France, cafés celebrating Korean culture have already spread: Joha Café in Lille, Café 750 in Bordeaux, Kiwa Café in Lyon. There are colorful pastries and oddities like bungeoppang, a fish-shaped cake filled with sweetened red bean paste. The number of Korean restaurants has also soared. According to the French-Korean media Francezone, they have increased from 40 to 200 in Paris alone in 20 years. In addition, there are more than 80 establishments in the rest of France.It's not a massive increase, but it's a big wave that has not happened by chance. K-food is a tool of the country's soft power. The flagship of this influence campaign, the K-food Festival, is a gastronomic festival funded by the Korean Ministry of Agriculture which took place in July 2022 at Le Carrousel du Louvre, a symbolic location. There, visitors could learn how to make kimbap (a kind of rice roll filled with vegetables) and line up with hundreds of fans – most of them under 25 years old – to nibble on skewers coated with sweet and sour sauce or bingsu (a dessert made of crushed ice and red beans).It would be wrong to dismiss the adolescent enthusiasm surrounding K-food because it has many assets to invite itself permanently onto our tables. First of all, it is inseparable from Korean pop culture, which is itself very powerful. ""In music videos, TV shows and Korean movies, the stars eat all the time,"" said Korean-born Walloon chef Sang Hoon Degeimbre, who has become an ambassador for the cuisine of his native country. ""And their fans imitate them, all over the world.""Following the global success of Squid Game, the recipe for dalgonas, caramels decorated with heart or umbrella designs that appear in the series, has gone viral. Meanwhile, director Bong Joon-ho's 2019 Palme d'Or winner Parasite has boosted sales of jjapaguri, an instant noodle dish prepared in the film.Another strength is that Korean cuisine is based on fermentation, which has made a comeback in high-end restaurants. Sang Hoon Degeimbre uses his country's ancestral techniques in his two-star restaurant L'Air du Temps in Liernu, in the Belgian province of Namur. ""Our farm is in the middle of five hectares of vegetables,"" explained the chef. ""In winter, we serve them fermented, Korean style. We make pickles (jang-a-jji), soy sauce (ganjang), chili paste (gochujang).""The Walloon chef's table also includes kimchi, a mainstay of Korean cuisine, a powerful lacto-fermented mixture made from cabbage, chili and garlic. In France, William Ledeuil was one of the first Michelin-starred chefs to use it. ""It allowed me to replace salt and pepper, which I try to stop using. I can use it as a condiment that adds a fragrant note,"" he explained in his Ze Kitchen Galerie restaurant, one of the most renowned Asian-inspired eateries in Paris.Pierre Sang, born in Korea and adopted at the age of 7 by a family in the Haute-Loire, has also contributed to familiarizing the French palette with Korean flavors. He uses kimchi to give ""pep"" to his dishes, especially the green lentils of Puy, a tribute to his adopted roots. His menu is very affordable: In his restaurant, the vegetarian bibimbap (a rice-based mixture, here enriched with lentils) is sold for €12.This is the other great strength of K-food: its accessibility. ""The country, which has had a very low standard of living for a long time, has remained faithful to 'poor people's dishes' from the vegetable garden,"" explained Sang Hoon Degeimbre. ""The Buddhist and vegetarian influence is still felt. And some street food is very popular."" Dong Né, a tiny Korean canteen in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, with a monastic decor (no posters or paintings, just a few wooden tables facing the open kitchen), is a good example.The first menu, priced at €15, contains three delicious plates, each of which is enough for a full meal. On the menu, a variety of kimbaps, Korean rolls prepared before our eyes, containing carrots, cucumbers and radishes wrapped in a ring of rice (held together by a ribbon of dried seaweed). Then come the tteokbokki, sticks of rice flour dough dipped in a very spicy sauce. And finally, the fried sweet potato noodles. The freshness, the variety of textures and the range of flavors, from sweet to spicy, make it a very good meal at a very reasonable price, especially since the cooks can prepare dishes without animal protein.The conquest of French taste buds has been achieved more recently through a clever fusion with French cuisine, often subtle. At Perception, a new Parisian restaurant, located near Pigalle, whose dining room is similar to a black box, the menu is not immediately distinguishable from that of a bistro-type establishment. Except that the beet pie is spiced up with bokbunja (black raspberry fermentation), the sesame salmon comes to life with Korean celery pickles and the chocolate ice cream is flavored with nori seaweed.""I wanted to bring as many people together as possible and for them to realize my influences only after they've eaten,"" explained Sukwon Yong in the kitchen. After training in Korea and perfecting his skills at the international Le Cordon Bleu network of schools, the chef honed his French recipes with William Ledeuil, who helped him move to France. ""The differences in technique between our cuisines are important,"" explained Sukwon Yong. ""Meat or fish stocks don't exist in Korea. But there are also similarities. The flavors are varied, we like condiments and we take our time. For some game dishes, I can marinate the meat for 48 hours!""At Octave, a stone's throw from the Trocadero in Paris, the Franco-Korean marriage reaches new heights of refinement. Owner Juliette Ju, born in Seoul but living in France for the past 23 years, has an impressive culinary resume, including stints with Joël Robuchon and William Ledeuil (him again). Don't be fooled by the discreet atmosphere of her gourmet restaurant, with its minimalist décor, tulips on the tables and sweet jazz melodies – the chef and her cuisine have character.To whet the appetite, guests are invited to squeeze a pipette of spicy soy sauce onto a vegetable ravioli before an exquisitely delicate foie gras makes its appearance. ""The liver has been marinated in miso,"" she explained. ""I use this soy paste as a seasoning instead of salt."" The rest is full of delights and surprises, like a mussel broth where grilled scallops splash around with green algae and a trio of cabbages (pointed, romanesco and Brussels sprouts). The Korean chef knows how to sublimate French dishes. The versatility of K-food seems to bring gourmets together and will prolong the ""trend"" for a few more centuries.",/en/food/
Hiroshima's sake wants to conquer the world,"    The prestigious Sempuku house has released a special brew for the G7 summit held in Japan. In response to declining alcohol sales in the archipelago, producers are betting on exports. ","For Hiroshima, the G7 summit scheduled from May 19 to 21 isn't merely a gathering of world leaders confined within the Prince Hotel at the edge of Ujina Island. It's also an opportunity to highlight the culinary gems of the eponymous prefecture in southwestern Japan, starting with its sakes. While it isn't the top sake producer in Japan – a title held by Niigata in the north of the archipelago – it prides itself on a distinctive terroir and continues to be a stronghold of innovation, leading notably to the creation of the highly esteemed ginjo sake (made from rice that's polished to at least 60%). They are eager to make this known to the world.The esteemed Sempuku brewery has, in response, unveiled a special edition sake – a sweet, easy-to-drink variety, best served chilled and bearing the G7 label – which might feature on the tasting menu for the attending world leaders. ""We're crossing our fingers,"" said Kiyotsugu Miyake, the sixth of his name, the dynamic and eloquent leader of the sake brewery nestled in the heights of Kure, a major military port located roughly 20 kilometers south of Hiroshima.Sempuku boasts an annual production of approximately 1.4 million liters of a variety of sakes, ranging from futsushu, or everyday sake, to junmai daiginjo, the most refined type. Established in 1856, the company thrived thanks to the naval activities and its arsenal set up in the late 19th century. ""In 1920, our Kuretsuru sake was brought aboard the Asama cruiser. After 220 days at sea, journeying through South Africa and Latin America, it remained unspoiled. It was then designated as the official sake of the naval bases,"" said Miyake, who is always eager to share the story of the resilient family business that survived the 1945 American bombings and the 2001 earthquake that partially destroyed its facilities.Sempuku is one of the main kura (a nickname given to sake producers) in Hiroshima, which are found in Kure as well as in the city of Higashi-Hiroshima, where eight establishments of the Saijo Association maintain their activity in a neighborhood with old-time charm, featuring buildings with white walls highlighted by dark wood and covered with black tiles, topped with red brick chimneys.These large companies are neighbors to smaller producers like Morikawa. The company, which still adheres to traditional methods, produces 45,000 liters per year in its premises adorned with a pleasant Japanese garden, located at the entrance of a hamlet in the heart of a vast plain of rice fields. Here, the sake is ""rather light, ideal to complement a meal,"" explained Tomonori Morikawa, head of the family business. This is due to the water that flows from Mount Noro, which overlooks the valley. ""It is very soft, without calcium or magnesium and with very little iron. It lacks some minerals to feed the fungi, but we have a special method to compensate,"" explained Motoharu Morikawa, in charge of sake-making – two fermentations with the addition of fungi and yeasts.",/en/food/
Desperate race for water in drought-hit vineyards of southern France,Investigation,"Everything is now in place to irrigate the vineyards of Saint-Etienne-des-Sorts (southern France): the large floating pipe that draws water from the Rhône, the brand-new pumping station, and the network of black pipes that climb the slopes and deploy their sprawling drip irrigation system, row after row. Inaugurated in April, this new network supplies water to around 400 hectares of vineyards. It standardizes a practice that was previously limited to a few individual wells and makeshift setups, subject to drought restrictions every summer. In May, a large part of the region is already under reinforced alert, and the neighboring sector is in crisis.""The project has come at just the right time,"" said David Genty, vice president of l’Association du Terroir des 3 Châteaux, which brings together the 46 participating owners. Thanks to the greater abundance of water from the Rhône river, the winegrowers can avoid irrigation restrictions. ""The vines are already suffering even though we started watering in April,"" explained Genty.Despite being well-suited to hot and dry climates, this Mediterranean crop is reaching its limits with global warming. ""Vines need very little water. But even this very little, we don't have it anymore: We're missing the rains of April, the storms of July and August 15,"" said the winemaker. Irrigation is intended to compensate for this changing climate and replace the rain that no longer falls at the right time, when the vine needs to take root and bear fruit.And never mind if it increases production costs and working hours. ""It's a matter of survival. Without water, this vineyard wouldn't be replanted,"" said Genty, pointing to piles of dead vines in the middle of a cleared plot. ""We're not inflating production; we just want to maintain yields close to the AOC [controlled designation of origin] ceiling of 40 to 50 hectolitres per hectare, and guarantee quality grapes.""Harvest taking place two weeks earlier than before 1980, reduced yields due to droughts and extreme heat, vine decline, increased alcohol content, decreased acidity: The effects of climate change on vineyards are now well-documented.In its report titled ""Stratégie Face Au Changement Climatique,"" (climate change strategy) published in February, the wine industry presents irrigation as one of the adaptation measures, calling for the development of water networks and storage facilities. On the ground, in the south of France, this solution is increasingly seen as the primary response to global warming, a necessary condition for the sustainability of vineyards.",/en/food/
The United States approves sales of the first-ever lab-grown chicken,    Doubts remain however as to whether artificial meat is actually an environmentally friendly alternative given the energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions involved in producing it. ,"The United States has granted its first-ever approvals to two companies to sell chicken grown directly from animal cells, becoming only the second country to allow lab-grown meat to be offered to consumers.The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved food safety systems at facilities of Upside Foods and Good Meat, a spokesperson for the agency told AFP on Wednesday, June 21, with the companies adding the products would be available soon at select restaurants.Both Upside Foods and Good Meat were cleared on safety grounds by the Food and Drug Administration in November, and the USDA last week reviewed and approved their product labels to ensure they were not misleading.""This approval will fundamentally change how meat makes it to our table,"" said Uma Valeti, CEO and founder of Upside Foods, in a statement. ""It's a giant step forward towards a more sustainable future – one that preserves choice and life.""Josh Tetrick, CEO of Good Meat, the cell-cultured food division of Eat Just, added its ""cultivated meat"" was now ""approved to sell to consumers in the world's largest economy.""Producing the meat in large, high-quality volumes is expensive. But, following approval, Upside processed its first order, placed by three-Michelin-star Chef Dominique Crenn's restaurant Bar Crenn in San Francisco.Good Meat, meanwhile, started production of its first batch that will be sold to celebrity chef and philanthropist Jose Andres. Andres will sell the product at a yet-to-be-revealed restaurant in the capital Washington.Several start-ups are aiming to produce the so-called lab-grown meat, which would allow humans to consume animal protein without the associated environmental harms of farming or animal suffering.The products differ from plant-based substitutes such as soy burgers that mimic the texture and flavor of meat but do not contain any animal protein. Eat Just was the first to receive authorization to make artificial meat, in Singapore in 2020.While succeeding in the general lab-meat market has proven complicated, some companies have set their sights on pet food, whose consumers are less picky. Bond Pet Foods, a Colorado start-up, is creating animal protein from a microbial fermentation process to feed dogs.Lab-grown meat involves first harvesting cells from a living animal or a fertilized egg, to establish a cell bank that can be kept for decades in deep freeze. They are then cultivated in steel tanks where they are fed nutrients similar to what animals would eat. After several weeks, the resulting product is ""harvested"" from the tank and molded into shapes, such as chicken filets or satay.While lab-grown meat has been billed as an environmentally friendly alternative, researchers from the University of California, Davis pushed back against this assumption in a study out last month, which hasn't yet been peer-reviewed. They found cultivated meat's environmental impact is likely to be ""orders of magnitude"" higher – at least in the case of beef, based on production methods. This is because of the energy required and greenhouse gasses emitted across all stages of production.One of the most significant factors is the use of ""purified growth media"" or the ingredients used to help animal cells multiply, in methods similar to those used by biotechnology firms to make pharmaceuticals. ""If companies are having to purify growth media to pharmaceutical levels, it uses more resources, which then increases global warming potential,"" said lead author Derrick Risner.A widely reported 2022 survey of 2,000 US adults by the nonprofit Farm Forward found two-thirds said they would eat cultivated-meat products.",/en/food/
Ceviche could disappear from Peruvian plates,"    Overfishing and oil spills are threatening the country's marine life – and endangering the national dish, for which fish is the main ingredient. ","How much longer will ceviche be served up in Peru? The dish of raw fish marinated in lime has become a national emblem. But the country's rich sealife is increasingly under threat from human activity. ""There is growing pressure on the ocean. Some species are showing clear signs of overexploitation and could disappear,"" said Juan Carlos Sueiro, a fishing expert with the NGO Oceana, the driving force behind the campaign for ocean preservation and sustainable fishing in the country.Along its 2,600-kilometer coastline, Peru boasts some of the world's best fishing. It benefits from a unique, phytoplankton-rich ecosystem, generated by the cold Humboldt Current, the most productive in the world. Peruvian waters are home to more than 1,000 species of fish, just as many molluscs, and nearly 600 crustaceans.Despite this abundance, scientists have been sounding the alarm for years over the overexploitation of resources. Fishermen too have expressed their concern. At the end of May, Lorenzo Vasquez, secretary-general of the fishermen's union in Chimbote in the north of Peru, told the newspaper La Republica,: ""The industry does not respect minimum catch sizes and juvenile species are caught at all times of the year.""Overfishing and illegal fishing are in the firing line. Industrialists are regularly accused of entering the forbidden 5-mile zone (about 9.5 kilometers off the coast) – a limit that is intended to protect coastal waters from deep-sea nets. ""Those 5 miles represent an extremely important zone for the reproduction and growth of the majority of species,"" said Sueiro. ""However, the poorly selective nets [used by industrial fishermen] do not distinguish between species or their size and indiscriminately catch larvae, young, adults, fish and molluscs."" The lack of checks and the absence of quotas often allow fishermen to operate with impunity.A legislative breakthrough may well bring positive change to the sector. Passed unanimously on April 12, by a Congress deemed largely inefficient and divided in the extreme, the new law redefines traditional artisanal fishing, regulates the size of boats and reinforces protection and controls within the 5-mile area.These are welcome measures to provide a framework for what is a key economic sector in Peru, providing a livelihood for 250,000 people and generating more than $3.2 billion (€2.9 billion) a year. Fish is exported, but also destined for the local market. Peruvians consume an average of 25 kilos per person per year, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Their diet includes bonito, sea bream, sole, giant squid and seafood (mainly scallops and prawns), 80% of which come from small-scale fishing.",/en/food/
Where to have lunch in Paris for less than €20? Our (new) selection of 15 spots,Selection,"Finding a very nice lunch spot for less than €20 in Paris is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge. In order to digest the inflation of costs (in wages, raw materials and energy), restaurant owners are naturally inflating their prices. According to the union Groupement des Hôtelleries et Restaurations de France, restaurant prices increased by 8% in the second half of 2022. Of the 100 gourmet and accessible places that we compiled last year, many have had to revise their menus and their ambitions.Here is a new selection of stylish spots at reasonable prices. Our criteria have remained the same: a set menu for €20 or less (prices observed at the time of our visit), seasonal products that are not imported from the other side of the planet and a warm welcome. In short, places to eat good, beautiful food, and to feel good.The selected locations are mostly located in the east of Paris, where the prices are more attractive. They all have their tricks to keep their costs low. Sometimes, they use leftovers and offal (the chic bistro Orgueil); other times, restaurateurs get away with playing on the quantity of dishes served (the tiny Korean stall Dong Né), replacing meat with vegetables (the canteen Aujourd'hui demain and its vegetarian burgers) or a ""noble"" fish with an underrated equivalent (Le Jourdain). Other establishments, such as OTTO, a Japanese dining cellar created by Michelin-starred chef Eric Trochon, rely on a very attractive lunchtime set menu to make their establishment known.Everywhere, these restaurants are going out of their way to entertain their customers without robbing them. And the energy they put into their work makes you want to encourage them. Bon appetite!This is a gem that we didn't expect in this narrow street parallel to Rue Rambuteau, just behind the Centre Pompidou. There are no tourists here, but there have been more and more regulars every day since this tiny restaurant (about 15 seats) opened in March 2022. The owner Mathieu Ciarlet, 50, left the IT sector to start this business with delight and generosity. The establishment is called ""C'est comme à la maison"" (""it's like what you cook at home"")and the name doesn't lie (as long as you cook very well!).Everything is made on the premises, ""except for the cream,"" said the owner who buries the tables under huge portions of marinated herring, stuffed cabbage, rabbit with mustard and seasonal fruit clafoutis. The weekly menu features a vegetarian dish every Wednesday and a fish dish every Friday. And there's even a nice Breton specialty like kig ha farz, a kind of Armorican stew. Prices are inversely proportional to the size and quality of the plates: starter/main course or main course/dessert costs €19 at lunchtime.",/en/food/
"Meat: French totem, political battle","    Long the preserve of the upper classes, meat is now an ideological icon. The 'greening' of personal practices is coming up against an almost identity-based resistance to this food with its many symbolic features. ","It's not so long ago that Roland Barthes wrote, in his 1957 Mythologies: ""Like wine, steak is, in France, a basic element, nationalized even more than socialized; it figures in all the settings of food life."" And yet, while meat – and red meat in particular – may remain ""in all the settings,"" it is no longer a matter of course. Long seen as a guarantor of good health, it now comes under scrutiny when consumed in excess – and is criticized in the name of the fight against climate change.To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the French will definitely have to eat less meat, a reduction ranging from 20% to 70% depending on different scenarios. Even the Cour des Comptes – responsible for overseeing French public finances – advised in May that the number of cows in France should be reduced to meet national climate commitments.While the government is taking up the issue, few politicians dare criticize France's meat consumption, which is twice the global average. They are too afraid of being accused of ""pissing off the French,"" as President Georges Pompidou put it, when it comes to such a symbolically charged food. Certainly, some on the left have taken up the issue. There are the abolitionists, like Aymeric Caron, Ecological Revolution for the Living MP for Paris. Likewise, the Green MP for Paris, Sandrine Rousseau, has also put forward her own arguments.But the rest of France's political leaders are either treading carefully or, on the contrary, jumping to meat's defense. In May, Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire visited a factory producing plant-based sausages and other highly processed substitute products. Nevertheless, it didn't stop him from pledging his love for real meat: ""I love eating a good steak and I don't like extremists who say we should stop eating meat altogether."" After leading his 2022 presidential campaign around meat, with a visit to a butchery school and defending the place of ""good meat"" in French cuisine, communist Fabien Roussel placed other symbols of popular authenticity this summer: He filmed himself sitting at a table in his Corsican campsite, preparing a herring salad.Like the car, meat is now at the heart of a cultural conflict that is all the more sensitive because it affects lifestyles. ""Regarding meat, I am leading a cultural battle,"" said Rousseau. ""It's the easiest and most effective individual gesture you can make to reduce your carbon footprint. Whether you live in a rural or urban area, in a single-parent family or not, everyone can do it."" Despite health and scientific arguments, there is continued resistance. ""We can't pretend that the fight against global warming is consensual, as some people claim, but at least I'm managing to bring this resistance to light,"" she continued.",/en/food/
Say cheesecake! Our selection of 15 shops in France to put a sweet smile on your face,Selection,"Cheesecake has been popular in England since the Middle Ages, before being imported to the United States by immigrants at the of the 19th century. The cake then developed with the creation of cream cheese in 1872, and then with the invention of pasteurized cheese by James L. Kraft in 1912. Within a few years, it was the traditional Jewish recipe developed in New York that proved to be the most popular. Some Eastern European countries including Poland have also developed their own recipe for cake made with cream cheese.The cheesecake is most often made with a base using crumbled hard cookies, with a topping made from cream cheese, cottage cheese or ricotta cheese, along with sugar and eggs. Baked (or not), this cake is sometimes served covered with fruit or a red berry coulis. In France, although there are many different kinds of cheesecake, from the Corsican fiadone to the white cheesecake from Alsace, the American-style cheesecake has long been the preserve of specialist bakeries and tea rooms. It became a real craze in Paris and in some French cities in the early 2010s.Having tasted roughly 40 cakes and taken into account various criteria (visual appeal, texture of the biscuit base, flavor of the cheese cream and not forgetting the sacrosanct quality-quantity-price ratio), here is our list of the best in France – in no particular order – for 2023.After learning his trade in various high-quality establishments (such as the Mandarin Oriental, Arnaud Larher and Pascal Lac), Julien Lambert settled with his wife in Epinal, his birthplace, in 2018. With specialties ranging from chocolates (including bars, candies and sweet treats), to cakes (individual portions and desserts to share), pastries and cookies, he also has a delightful and relaxed tea room where you can sit down.Our opinion: The first flavor we get is the acidity of the citrus jelly, followed by the creaminess of the cheese mousse. Then, the comforting, tangy softness of the lemon cake takes over, before ending with the textured sweetness of the thin layer of sweet pastry.Composition: Sweet pastry, lemon cake, lemon syrup, lemon cream, cheesecake mousse, citrus jelly.Price: €4. Epinal (Vosges, northeastern France). julienlambertpatisserie.frBased in Bois-Colombes in the Hauts-de-Seine department west of Paris, Stéphane Glacier, winner of the Meilleur Ouvrier de France Pâtissier award, has made it his mission to give his customers a top-of-the-range pastry shop at the most affordable prices possible.

Carrying on the legacy of the 'Pope of Beaujolais' at the Domaine Marcel Lapierre,Feature,"The scene takes place on the day of the Beaujolais Nouveau celebration, in the early 2010s, in a chic establishment in Biarritz, southwestern France. A young oenologist is preparing wines for tasting when she is taken to task by a stranger: ""Are you still working with Lapierre? Be careful. Since Marcel died, it's his son who's taken over, and he's making a mess!"" The young woman listens, gritting her teeth. Then, as she was about to greet the intruder, she slipped him her business card: ""Here, I'll leave you my contact details. That way, you'll know how to reach the sister of Lapierre's son, the one whose work is shit!""While Camille Lapierre recounts the anecdote with a smile, the look on her face is unmistakable: time has passed, but she hasn't forgiven that moment of stupidity. Marcel Lapierre died of cancer on October 11, 2010, and it's an understatement to say that many of his competitors in the Beaujolais region were eagerly anticipating the people who would carry on his work. Lapierre had become a benchmark in France and around the world, the king of Morgon and natural wine alike, after years of being regarded as a madman. Shortly before his death, the French Wine Review even referred to him as the ""Pope of Beaujolais."" And everyone knows that being the son of a pope is not a comfortable position to be in.Twelve years have passed. That's a long time in human terms, but for a vineyard, it's no time at all. We're sitting in the shade of a tree, in Villié-Morgon, some 50 kilometers north of Lyon. The pretty courtyard separates the houses from the winery, at the heart of the estate. Opposite us is Mathieu Lapierre, 41. While watching the fire – he was a cook in a previous life and hasn't lost his touch – he listens to his sister Camille, 36, who joined him in 2013.This story in Biarritz makes Mathieu laugh more than it annoys him. ""It's human, and it's true that I had no interest in failing for the first vintage, in 2011. In fact, I was lucky because it was a superb year. But in reality, I'd been working with Marcel for quite some time. We'd made the last few vintages together, so I wasn't a newcomer at all.""The idea of taking over from his father was not an easy one. At least, Mathieu wasn't prepared for it. ""It fell into my lap in 2004,"" he says. ""I was living in Canada when my father came to me and said, 'you know, my mole... well, it's not a mole.' He had melanoma. He knew he was doomed, so he added that if I wanted to take over, I had to get back to France fast."" Of course, the children had always been involved with the life of the estate, punctuated by the immutable chronology and joyous tumult of the grape harvest. They knew all the joys and constraints, the anguish of the little mistakes that can ruin everything, and the joy of producing wine that you believe in. But they had left to make their lives elsewhere – Mathieu in the kitchen, Camille as an oenologist.",/en/food/
"In Argentina, the boom of 'specialty coffee shops'","    In the land of maté, the coffee served in coffee shops has long been of poor quality, but things are changing with the emergence of numerous highly profitable businesses that offer entrepreneurs an anti-crisis formula. ","Rita, Posta, Franja... Almost everywhere in Buenos Aires' trendy neighborhoods, short-named and similarly-styled shops have been flourishing: small, tidy, with short menus featuring the essential flat whites, lattes and espressos. Over the past three years or so, Argentina has seen a boom in these 'specialty coffee shops' – establishments offering a higher-quality beverage, from the beans to the way they are roasted and the maintenance of the machines.The trend started where all gastronomic fashions begin, in Palermo, Buenos Aires' fashionable and touristy district, before taking over the rest of the city. But it has also spread to the rest of the country. ""There's been a change in taste. Coffee culture has always existed here: Argentines love to meet outside for a snack or to have breakfast with a croissant [""medialuna,"" in its Argentine version] and a coffee. But now they do it with a good drink,"" remarked the barista Ramsès Balzan as he sipped a filtered Honduran infusion with notes of chocolate and red fruit on one of the capital's terraces. For a long time, the idea of drinking espresso in Argentina was enough to make black coffee lovers wince – the local bars offered buttery-flavored mugs and sometimes burnt beverages served too hot.In an article published in 2019, BBC Mundo tried to explain ""why coffee is so bad in Buenos Aires, the city of the most beautiful cafés."" Even in the sumptuous ""historic cafes,"" declared cultural heritage because of their architecture or history, ""the coffee itself has never been important. What is important is physically being in the space,"" Carlos Cantini, the author of the Café Contado blog, explained to the British media at the time. Especially since, according to the specialist, among the millions of Italian and Spanish immigrants who landed in Argentina between the late 19th and early 20th century, the Spaniards were the ones who imposed their poor-quality coffee culture. Moreover, in the land of maté (the region's traditional infusion), the press agency Télam reported that annual per capita consumption amounts to just 1 kg (against 5 kg in the European Union).""We prepare coffee with a high level of concentration. For an espresso, it's 30 milliliters of water and 18 grams of coffee weighed on the scales. We serve it at 70 degrees Celsius so that it retains all its flavor,"" boasted Eugenia Cuttat, the manager of the first Cuervo, a pioneer of specialty coffee shop in Buenos Aires he opened in 2017 before launching three similarly-named establishments in the following years.",/en/food/
"Translating Salman Rushdie: 'I've been offered a pseudonym, but I've always refused'",Conversation,"Novels are piled in every corner of Gérard Meudal's living room, even covering the sofa. The 73-year-old translator has to make do with a stool to rest his rangy frame. He apologizes for the mess in his Paris apartment; on this August afternoon, he has just returned from a poetry festival in Sète, in the south of France, and is about to leave again, this time for his country house in the Cher region in the center of the country.That's where he was on August 12, 2022 when he learned with horror that Salman Rushdie, the author he has been translating for 15 years, had been stabbed at a conference in Chautauqua, New York. ""I was devastated, convinced he wouldn't survive.""A month later, while the 75-year-old novelist was still in hospital with serious injuries, Meudal received the manuscript of Victory City, written before the attack – an epic saga set in 14th-century India that depicts a perfectly egalitarian city founded by a young girl possessed by a deity. The novel was published in France on September 6.Translating Rushdie is much more than a literary affair. His publishers and translators are also exposed to the repercussions of the fatwa against the writer. Some have paid for their association with Rushdie with their own lives. Declared in 1989 by Ayatollah Khomeini in the wake of the publication the previous year of The Satanic Verses, which he deemed blasphemous to Islam, the fatwa condemned to death not only the author but ""all those involved in its publication"". This led to a wave of attacks in the early 1990s.In 1991 Rushdie's Japanese translator Hitoshi Igarashi was murdered in Tokyo, shortly after his Italian translator, Ettore Capriolo, was stabbed in Milan. In 1993, in Sivas, Turkey, an angry mob set fire to the hotel hosting a festival attended by Aziz Nesin, who had translated and published (without the author's permission) extracts from The Satanic Verses in Turkish. While Nesin managed to escape, 37 other people died in the fire. That same year, Rushdie's Norwegian publisher, William Nygaard, was shot three times outside his home in Oslo. In France, the translator of The Satanic Verses remained anonymous for security reasons. Published by Christian Bourgois, the French version is credited to ""A.

Saliva: Gliding between desire and disgust,    Le Monde columnist Maïa Mazaurette embarks on an adventure like no other as she steers her vessel through the currents of sexuality's fluids. ,"Let's face it: Sex is about an activity (and an organ) that gets wet. This summer and fall, sex columnist Maïa Mazaurette is donning her scuba suit to help us uncover these fluids. In this latest episode, we end up with an amuse-bouche – an encounter with saliva.Characteristics: Saliva, a clear liquid produced by the salivary glands, allows us to chew, swallow, talk, protect ourselves from a good number of bacteria... and have sexual practices outside the sacrosanct vaginal penetration. In France, nine out of 10 people have already sucked or licked their partner's genitals (French Institute Of Public Opinion, 2017).Figures: According to Norwegian author Asmund Eikenes, who has a Ph.D. in cell biology, each day, the salivary glands produce up to one and a half liters of spit, more than a carton of milk! (From The Curious Science of Bodily Fluids: Discover What's Floating Around Inside of You!, 2022.) This milk carton comes in two forms: viscous resting saliva and stimulated saliva.Deliciousness: By transforming solid into liquid, saliva makes us feel the taste of food. It even makes us anticipate pleasure, hence the expression ""to salivate"" (in front of profiteroles). Of course, we can also salivate metaphorically: at the prospect of an erotic rendezvous, for example.A kiss: Kissing with tongues makes teenagers fantasize... but it does so to experts in bacterial transmission as well. In 2012, a group of Dutch researchers led by microbiology professor Remco Kort collected saliva samples from 21 couples before and after a wet kiss lasting around 10 seconds. They found that a couple who kissed with such intensity more than nine times a day would share enough bacteria to mark their respective tongues for life. Secondly (and a little more reassuringly), the saliva flowing into the stomach after such a kiss would prevent new bacteria from settling in the oral cavity and on the tongue of both lovers.Symbolic: Sorry to those of you who are eating breakfast, but saliva sends us back to the infernal acts of drooling and spitting. When it comes to drooling, of course, we think of childhood and babies. Adults, however, continue to drool, in the flowing plenitude of sleep (watch out for morning breath!). As for spitting on other people, it sends us back to the world of dirtiness... and even disease, as Covid-19 reminds us.And it has a much more negative connotation. Psychoanalyst and sex therapist Guy Lesœurs writes in an article entitled ""Psychanalyse du postillon"" (""The Psychoanalysis of Gobbing Spit,"" 2022) that ""spitting or hawking is a missile more or less charged with contempt and salivary substance, whose parts are gathered in the mouth and compressed to come out violently and nastily."" It's clearly uncivil violence: Spitting in the street is an offense against the rules of polite society, even if a loogie has a liberating function.",/en/m-le-mag/
The French – and Jean Dujardin – certainly embraced the clichés for the Rugby World Cup opening ceremony. Does anyone care?,The opening ceremony of the Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France on September 8 unfolded with a very French style of fanfare.,"Did you miss the opening ceremony of the Rugby World Cup on September 8, before the France-New Zealand match? If so, you missed an enchanting fresco of rural France. You missed the Rooster Man and Jean Miche, the baker on a bicycle whose name is a play on the French word for loaf, miche, and the typically French name, Michel. You also missed two stars of the chanson française, Zaz, as a chanteuse, and Vianney, as a troubadour. The accordion, too, made an appearance of course.You also missed one hell of a fashion show. Miche the baker, played by French A-list actor Jean Dujardin, wasn't dressed for a big night out, but rather for an early morning spent kneading dough in the boutique's basement. He wore a white undershirt, or Marcel, symbolic of manual labor, imbued with the perspiration of the working man, the scent of patriotism. Indeed, it was a Frenchman, Marcel Eisenberg, the owner of a hosiery factory, who designed the tank top in the 19th century.On his head, or rather mostly in his hand, Miche the bread king also had a flat cap. The British call this a newsboy cap, because once upon a time it was the headgear worn by young boys delivering newspapers. The Americans call it a golf cap, because it used to be such a common sight on the course and New Zealanders call it a cheese cutter cap, because the local cheesemongers used to wear them. In France, it's called a casquette plate (just a plain old flat cap), but the term gavroche is perfectly acceptable and far more evocative – you're thinking Les Misérables, aren't you?For one night only, Dujardin also returned to the accessory that made his name in The Artist: the pencil mustache. Experts would no doubt have called it a double pencil mustache, as it was made up of two sections of hair, and moreover saluted the obvious effort made to achieve such a clean result. As for Dujardin, who is about to shoot a Zorro series for French TV, he'll have plenty more time to enjoy revisiting his facial hair.Alongside this panorama of days gone by, the omnipresence of the plastic bottle was jarring. The four visible in the picture above alone signify how hot it was in the Stade de France that night, as Paris melted under a heatwave, and that the newfound reusable bottle reflex is not quite cemented in place yet. Or perhaps this too was a nod to nostalgia – there was a time when plastic bottles, first marketed in 1947 and popularized in the 1970s, were seen as a major advance in civilization, bringing down prices and making everyday life easier. Times have changed, not that you'd know it from this ceremony.",/en/m-le-mag/
The transparent backpack aimed at preventing school shootings,"Some products, born in the United States, are spreading around the globe. Le Monde tested the transparent backpack, designed to prevent pupils from bringing guns to school.","It's the back-to-school accessory of the year. Some US schools are now mandating the use of see-through backpacks. For the new school year, there are still only a handful who have done this and they're generally located within the perimeter of recent massacres. In Flint (Michigan) – some 50 kilometers from Oxford High School, where a high school student killed four students, in November 2021 – all backpacks were banned last year. Since the start of the new school year, from kindergarten to secondary school, only transparent bags are allowed.It's the same situation in the Dallas (Texas) school district. After the shooting at Robb d'Uvalde Elementary School, 500 kilometers away (19 children and two teachers were killed, in May 2022), the transparent backpack was imposed from middle school onward. This year, the measure applies from kindergarten onwards. After all, in January, in Newport News (Virginia), a first-grader did shoot his teacher, seriously wounding her.Obviously, opaque bags don't kill students, but transparent models are being presented as a compromise designed to facilitate the work of school security teams, without the need to install metal detectors or ban school bags altogether. The objective is to combat firearms, with school shootings rising from 34 in 2013 to 305 in 2022, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database maintained by data scientist David Riedman.The graphs in Riedman's database show that only 41% of shooters attended the school they targeted and that shootings often started in the school parking lot. ""Transparent backpacks would therefore have no impact on most school shootings,"" said the expert, convinced that it's a matter of taking more preventative action.In Florida, after the shooting at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (17 dead) in February 2018, students had to switch to transparent backpacks for their return to class. This was even though the killer was no longer attending the school when he committed the massacre and his assault rifle would never have fit into a backpack, transparent or opaque. Faced with resistance from high school students and March For Our Lives activists (""March for Our Lives"" was the name given to the March 24, 2018 demonstrations calling for greater gun control in the United States), who wondered whether they were being mocked, the measure has since been dropped.While it is difficult to prove that transparent backpacks serve a purpose, it is also difficult to say that they don't either. ""They're not yet widespread enough for their usefulness to be rigorously measured,"" pointed out Jaclyn Schildkraut, director of the Regional Gun Violence Research Consortium at the Rockefeller Institute of Government.",/en/m-le-mag/
Paris park renamed in memory of Iranian Mahsa Amini,"    From September 16, the Villemin Garden in the 10th arrondissement of Paris will bear the name of Mahsa Jina Amini. The death of the 22-year-old a year ago after her arrest by Tehran's morality police had led to nationwide protests. ","The June 7 vote by the Paris Council was unanimous. On Saturday, September 16, the Jardin Villemin (Villemin Garden) in the 10th arrondissement of Paris was renamed after Mahsa Jina Amini. The 22-year-old Iranian died on the same date, three days after her arrest in Tehran by the morality police for violating the Islamic Republic's dress code.Her death provoked an unprecedented protest movement in Iran. Paris posthumously awarded the Kurdish-born student honorary citizenship in October 2022. ""It was our duty to defend this aspiration for freedom for women and the Iranian people,"" explained Laurence Patrice, the 10th arrondissement's elected representative in charge of remembrance and the veteran community. ""We wanted to pay tribute to her in a place that is very important to the Kurdish community.""Since 2002, when the refugee center in Sangatte (northern France) was dismantled, the Villemin Garden has become a meeting place for migrants, particularly Afghans. Located close to the Gare du Nord train station, ""Little Kabul,"" as it is nicknamed, is a stopping-off point for many of them. On a sunny Monday in late August, Afghan exiles sat on the benches in front of the basketball court, but refused to speak with Le Monde.Yakou, a 29-year-old man with a smile on his face, agreed to express himself. He said he was from Sudan and had been in France for just over a month. ""Every day, it's the same. I have a coffee. I come here, I look for work at Pôle Emploi [employment office] and I look for somewhere to sleep,"" he explained in stammering Italian. Asylum seekers have often occupied the premises with sleeping bags before being removed by the police.Close to the Gare de l'Est train station on the right bank, the park extends eastward to the Canal Saint-Martin. At 20,000 square meters, it's the largest green space in this arrondissement. Chestnut, plane, oak and other deciduous trees stand side by side with flower beds and exotic decorative shrubs.At the foot of an apartment building, Le Poireau Agile, a collective gardening site created in 2005 and managed by an association, is a haven of peace for pollinating insects and home to hundreds of plant species. Its plots cover an area of 220 square meters. On the promenade, a diverse population strolled by. Alongside the migrants, Sunday joggers trotted along the paths, local residents read the newspaper and strollers waited by the sandbox while the little ones played with their shovels and buckets.",/en/m-le-mag/
Reading in English is on trend for French teens,"    English-language departments in bookshops are experiencing an unexpected surge of young French customers, driven by the vogue for 'romantasy'. ","Once limited to a small corner reserved for English-speaking tourists in need of a holiday read, shelves devoted to literature in its original language are taking on an increasingly important role in French bookshops. Groups of teenagers flock to them in search of specific titles, discovered via hashtags on social media devoted to literature, such as #booktok, #bookstagram and #booktube.Teens who read? And in a foreign language, no less? The phenomenon was first noted by booksellers. ""Two departments are particularly popular with young people in our store,"" explained Delphine Ripoche, assistant manager of the Durance bookshop in Nantes, ""dark romance and books in their original language."" Dark romance is the literary genre popularized by Fifty Shades of Grey, featuring love stories tinged with gently sado-masochistic sex scenes and erotic power play between lovers. Most of the popular VO (original version, in this case English) books come from this genre.""The English-language market has been growing steadily for several years now,"" confirmed Stéphanie Laurent, French bookseller Fnac-Darty's director of publications, France's leading retail chain stores for cultural and electronic products. ""At the end of August, the top trend in our stores was up  20% compared to 2022.""Back in the 1990s and 2000s, observers were astonished to see young people flocking to English-language bookstores to read the Harry Potter saga without waiting for French translations. Today, aided by the Pass Culture scheme – which, since February 2021, allocates every young person between 15 and 18 an annual credit of €20 to €300 to spend on cultural goods – this new boom in imported literature is nonetheless difficult to quantify. Contacted by Le Monde, neither the Centre National du Livre (National Book Center) nor the Syndicat de la Librairie Française (French Bookstore Union) were able to provide nationwide figures on these sales.But at the Durance bookshop, sales of books from the foreign language section, which features almost 3,000 titles in English, almost doubled between 2019 and 2022, reaching €300,000 last year, or 7.5 % of total sales. ""It's a small space, which we actually enlarged before the summer, but it's constantly full. Young people, especially girls, come in groups, often with specific requests,"" explained Delphine Gentils, Durance's department manager.Understanding the surprising enthusiasm of this clientele – who don't consult traditional channels for suggestions such as the literary press, and who booksellers have long feared would desert them in favor of Amazon – requires a visit to TikTok and Instagram.",/en/m-le-mag/
The hunt for Paul McCartney's first bass,"    Like 'The Mona Lisa,' its value is priceless. The musician composed 'Love Me Do' and wrote 'Let It Be' using his first bass guitar and its loss left him inconsolable. Thousands of Internet users have set out to track it down. ","Although he has left his mark on music history, 81-year-old Paul McCartney still has one regret: Losing his very first bass guitar, a Höfner 500/1 model, along the way. Officially lost in 1969 when the Beatles split up, the legendary instrument has become a kind of pop Holy Grail.The Lost Bass operation was launched on September 2, aimed at gathering any information that might help locate the famous instrument with the help of a website, a hashtag (#tracingthebass), and an international press campaign.Why launch the initiative 54 years after the fact? Nick Wass, consultant and former marketing director of German luthier Höfner, said: ""A few years ago, I went to Paul's studio in Sussex, England, to work on his instruments. He asked me: 'Do you know where my first bass went?' I sensed how sentimental it was for him, so I started researching – but the instrument could be anywhere in the world. I teamed up with Scott and Naomi Jones [former English journalists], who have many contacts and that was that.""If the multi-instrumentalist (he also plays piano) has never forgotten his Höfner 500/1, it's because it represents a significant part of his life. In the early days of the Beatles, McCartney played guitar, while Stuart Sutcliffe played bass. When Sutcliffe left the band in 1961, McCartney replaced him and took over his instrument.But on a trip to Hamburg, Germany, with his three friends, he found a surprisingly light, semi-acoustic brunette (the model also comes in blond). ""Its symmetrical curves are reminiscent of a violin, enabling a left-handed player like Paul to play it,"" said Wass.The little German guitar also had the merit of being affordable (the equivalent of £30 at the time), unlike the heavy, expensive US models. ""As soon as I bought it, I fell in love with it,"" said McCartney in The Beatles Diary. An Intimate Day-by-Day History (Hors Collection, 2000), by Barry Miles. From 1961 to 1963, the artist and his bass forged not only the sound, but also the legend of The Beatles: With it, he recorded Please Please Me and With the Beatles (1963), the group's first two albums, and composed She Loves You and Love Me Do, where its muffled timbre can be heard, ""like the sound of a fist banging on an old cupboard,"" said Wass.The bass followed its owner everywhere, from Abbey Road to world tours. But in 1963, a newcomer arrived: Another Höfner sent by the luthier, the original being in need of repair. ""It was restored in 1964 and transformed quite a bit – in particular, it was painted yellow,"" said Wass. McCartney used it as an emergency bass until 1965 when the Beatles threw it all in. By then, the band was tired: too many frenzied fans and exhausting concerts. ""They were fed up with being seen as the Fab Four, and not as a real rock band,"" said Wass. ""They decided to stop touring, changed their haircuts and their look.""",/en/m-le-mag/
Pilot study identifies widespread presence of pesticides in French agricultural soils,"    Over 100 molecules were detected at 47 sites across France. At least one agent was found on 46 of the 47 sites examined, including on land that had never been sprayed. ","Regarding pesticides, Brussels's legislative and regulatory work has never been so out of step with current scientific developments. While the draft European regulation on the ""sustainable use"" of agricultural toxins is being held up in Strasbourg's European Parliament, French researchers published the first nationwide pilot study on the presence of these products in French agricultural soils in the May 25 issue of the journal Environmental Science & Technology.Based on a sample of 47 sites, their findings point to the almost widespread presence of around 60 active substances in arable land and on land that has never been treated. For the researchers, the presence of such products in soils is not surprising. Still, their persistence, number and the concentrations measured are ""unexpected and concerning,"" with levels frequently posing a risk to soil organisms.The scientists monitored 111 pesticide residues at 47 sites across France, selected from the 2,200 Soil Quality Measurement Network locations, launched some 20 years ago and led by the country's National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE). At least one substance was found on 46 of the 47 sites included in the study, which is 98%. On average, 15 distinct molecules were detected in each sample, with a maximum of 33 distinct products on a single site. All the arable soils tested contained at least seven different substances.""It was ANSES [France's French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety, a French government agency] that asked us, in 2018, to look into the possibility of using our soil monitoring network for phytopharmacovigilance purposes,"" said Claire Froger, a researcher with INRAE and primary author of the study. ""The budget allocated to this work enabled us to select around 50 sites, mainly field crop plots and, to a lesser extent, vineyards and orchards, but also 'control' sites, grasslands and forests that had not been treated.""Although spread across the country and representing a wide range of characteristics, the sample is too small to be generalized to mainland France, Froger said.Unsurprisingly, the most frequently found pesticide residues were herbicides and, first and foremost, glyphosate and its main degradation product, AMPA, found in 70% and 83% of the sites studied respectively. Fungicides from the controversial SDHI family (known as ""succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors"") were also present in over 40% of samples. As the authors point out, most of the products found are only used in conventional agriculture, with the exception of certain pyrethrum-derived insecticides which are also authorized for use in organic farming.",/en/food/
Charlotte opens Maison Gainsbourg to honor her father's legacy,Long Read,"The public knew exactly where to gather when they heard Jane Birkin had died. On July 16, several dozen admirers spontaneously gathered at 5 bis Rue de Verneuil, in Paris's 7th arrondissement. They laid flowers and candles, graffitied ""Merci Jane,"" ""Jane 4 ever,"" and pasted drawings and photos on the walls in front of the house where the singer and actress shared Serge Gainsbourg's life for almost a decade. The new graffiti was superimposed on those dedicated to the singer, who died in 1991. For a long time, this street art facade was the only visible piece of this legendary family.Starting on September 20, visitors will be able to go through the gates and visit the private home. Across the street, at number 14, they will then be able to visit the museum and its trail, retracing the artist's life through 450 objects, a bookshop and a piano-bar café named Le Gainsbarre.This is how their daughter Charlotte Gainsbourg wanted it. In the middle of August, her face was visibly etched with grief. A few days earlier, the actress had carried her mother's coffin into the church of Saint-Roch (in Paris's 1st arrondissement) during a ceremony attended by family and friends, including Catherine Deneuve, Benjamin Biolay and Alain Souchon, and celebrities like Brigitte Macron. She was now ""orphaned,"" she said, her voice full of tears, during her speech at the funeral mass.Birkin's death echoed the sudden death of her father when she was 19. At the time, she experienced the grief of his fans as an invasion of her privacy. ""I put on a brave face and smiled, but it was very violent. I didn't want to hear any of their memories, and I wanted to be left alone,"" she explained, both of her hands clutching a cup of tea. Nowadays, she ""listens"" and ""receives."" ""I see all the good my mother did and I want to hear about it,"" she said, her unassuming figure dressed entirely in black.The summer of 2023 should have been a joyous one. It marked the culmination of an adventure spanning almost 30 years. This Maison Gainsbourg project was Charlotte's own vision. She, the best-known child of Serge Gainsbourg, who had three others, was the one who always carried it. Although the singer himself started publicly exhibiting his family life to the world at the turn of the 1970s, he had previously been much more discreet.Natacha and Paul, the eldest children he had in the 1960s with his second wife Françoise-Antoinette Pancrazzi, the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, did not grow up on Rue de Verneuil. They barely knew their father, who met Birkin in the summer of 1968, and have always shunned the limelight. The fourth, Lulu, son of Bambou, his last companion, was just five years old when his father died.",/en/m-le-mag/
"Rugby World Cup in France: No English, please!","    Communication in and around the stadiums is mainly in (broken) English, a breach of a French law highlighted by defenders of Molière's language. They hope the Paris 2024 Olympic Games will be a different story. ","The opening ceremony of the Rugby World Cup was intended to celebrate France. French movie star Jean Dujardin, wearing a white Marcel undershirt and beret, delivered loaves of bread on a delivery trishaw across the field of the Stade de France. The 20-minute performance had been crafted as an ode to gastronomy and bal-musette à la française. Reactions were mixed, to say the least, but the message was clear: The international competition, which runs from September 8 to October 28, is taking place in France.Yet on the banners inside the stadium, the pennants in the host cities, and the official tournament website, the English words ""Rugby World Cup France 2023"" are all over the place. On the French version, ""opening match"" has replaced ""match d'ouverture,"" ""pool"" has replaced ""poule"" and ""next match"" ""prochain match."" Strangely enough, a few days after Le Monde asked the French culture ministry about the issue, some English terms were translated into French.This intrusion of English into an event held in France is a cause for concern among some. ""The status of the French language should be respected when France organizes major international sporting events,"" lamented Loïc Depecker, a former delegate for the French language at the culture ministry. ""At this Rugby World Cup 2023, organized in France, the [text of the] French team jersey is written in English."" This looks bad for French President Emmanuel Macron, who said the defense of Francophonie [the people and countries who speak French around the world] would be one of his priorities. He is preparing to inaugurate, on October 19, the Cité Internationale de la Langue française (International City of the French Language) at a castle in Villers-Cotterêts, northern France.In a written question, Annie Genevard, a member of Parliament, ""alerted"" Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak ""to the importance of avoiding the abusive use of English in signage, advertising, ticketing, announcements, refereeing, results display panels and field-side advertising strips."" ""Is this issue being considered? Is it being worked on?"" she wondered.Article 3 of legislation passed on August 4, 1994, on the use of the French language, specifies that ""any inscription or announcement placed or made on the public space, in a place open to the public or a means of public transport and intended to inform the public must be in the French language.""""The law, from particular commercial standpoints or when relating to slogans and registered trademarks, outside the obligations imposed on public players, shows its limits at times,"" conceded the ministry. According to Alfred Gilder, a French writer who once sat on a language body at a French justice and finance ministry, ""Article 3 is very poorly implemented."" Daniel Zielinski, a senior official in charge of the French language at the French Sports Ministry, is a member of an expert panel responsible for sports terminology. For the World Cup, a list of rugby vocabulary was published in the French government's official gazette on September 5.",/en/m-le-mag/
"David Grann, the master of literary investigation who's busy seducing Hollywood",Profile,"Before immersing himself in a new story, David Grann begins his day by pulling down the blinds in his office. From the silent room where he works every day, from 8:30 am until dinnertime, with the occasional break for a walk around the neighborhood, the American writer meticulously studies the piles of documents and archives that overflow from his library and spread across the wooden floor. Even before writing a single line, this task keeps him busy for months, sometimes years.As a staff writer at The New Yorker, the United States' most prestigious magazine, Grann has already chronicled a series of historic events: from a disastrous crossing of Antarctica, organized in the mid-2010s by a fan of 19th-century explorer Ernest Shackleton, to the racist murders ordered by a gang of white supremacists locked in US maximum security prisons. He even covered the investigation of a hardened cop who tackled a cold case in Poland only to discover that one of the suspects wrote about his crime in a novel that has remained confidential. These incredible stories have one thing in common: They're all very real.Le Monde met with the 56-year-old author on a June afternoon, in his comfortable home in the New York suburbs, where he lives with his wife and two children. On his desk was the material he has analyzed over the past five years: a bound work on the different types of British navy ships, old medical treatises on leg amputation, a compilation of academic studies on the work of Moby Dick's author Herman Melville and an account of the discovery of longitude calculation by an English watchmaker, which reduced the number of shipwrecks (The Longitude Prize). These documents, among dozens of others, served as reference and inspiration for his fifth book The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder, published in April by Doubleday.This time, the subject of his investigation dated back to 1740. At the time, a British naval vessel hunting a Spanish galleon was wrecked on an island off Patagonia, in the southern end of South America. In addition to damage and scurvy, a mutiny, several cases of cannibalism and one murder decimated the 250-strong crew. Only a handful of sailors managed to return to England, where a court martial was scheduled to try them for disobeying their captain's orders. They faced hanging.To defend themselves, the survivors came up with contradictory accounts, each publishing their version in the press and accusing the others of spreading false information. In this factual battle – which is said to have inspired philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire – the reporter discovered a ""rare resonance"" with today's culture of disinformation and fake news. ""It's not just an amazing story in the 18th century, it's illustrative of the human character, the human condition, and something larger about the search and the meaning of truth in our society,"" he said.",/en/m-le-mag/
The United States is in the grips of 'tipflation',"Some products and practices, born in the United States, are spreading around the globe. In her column, Le Monde's Guillemette Faure examines how tipping for products and services is getting out of control.","""How much do you tip?"" The question has long signaled a tourist in New York. It was understood that the locals knew. Occasionally, a waiter would even add a handwritten note to the bill intended for a table of French diners specifying, with a smiley face, that service was not included. Now, it's the Americans who ask. For takeout, do you leave a tip? And for your coffee, which you carry to your table? What if it's a make-your-own salad bar? Things were simpler when the social rule was clear, as illustrated in a scene from Reservoir Dogs in which one of the film's gangsters, offended, says: ""What do you mean, you don't tip?""Tipping isn't so natural anymore, now that it's asked for anywhere you go, a trend that took hold five years ago when the tablet payment terminal gradually replaced the tip jar at the counter. When paying by credit card, tip suggestions are already given... and at higher levels than in the past. Above all, the tablet has become a must for services where tipping was not commonplace – takeout orders, for example – or for professionals who, until now, did not ask for tips, such as bakers.In coffee shops, it's a headache. A tip for a cappuccino with a heart in the foam? After all, someone put a lot of effort into making it. But what about a cookie? Or a bottle of water? Recently, in the New York Times etiquette section, a reader asked if she should really ""tip"" the dermatologist who handed her the payment terminal. Also see the hotel manager at checkout: ""How much do you intend to leave the maid?"" What can I say? You mean, if I don't leave anything, she doesn't get paid?According to a survey by personal finance site Bankrate, 41% of Americans polled believe that ""businesses should pay their employees better rather than relying so much on tips."" While Americans tipped 10% in the 1950s and 15% in the 1990s, today tips more often hover around 20%. Sure, inflation has driven up prices, but why should it drive up tips?Some of the ""tipflation"" can be traced back to Covid-19 and the lockdown. ""We've largely tipped delivery drivers because they take risks, and restaurants to help them survive,"" said one New Yorker. Another possible explanation: the tablets, again, which set the standards with their suggestions. When the percentages in the boxes displayed are so precise, they give the impression of a calculation as rigorous as a sales tax amount (18%, 20%, 25% or 30%?). Of course, the more boxes suggest ($1, $2, or $3 for a coffee?), the cruder the option of checking ""no tip"" seems. And, unlike the money left on the table as you leave the restaurant, the tablet tip is displayed in front of the waiter's eyes, or even those of the next customer.",/en/m-le-mag/
"Where there's sex, there's blood",    Le Monde columnist Maïa Mazaurette embarks on an adventure like no other as she steers her vessel through the currents of sexuality's fluids. ,"Let's face it: Sex is about an activity (and an organ) that gets wet. This summer and fall, sex columnist Maïa Mazaurette is donning her scuba suit to help us uncover these fluids. This week, we see red and bathe in the blood of erections, menstruation and the hymen.- Etymology: From the Latin sanguis, blood is associated with everything that makes life possible – from conception to death via the delights of eroticism. It's perfectly logical, then, that our language uses similar expressions to describe our ""hot-blooded"" lovers, whose desire ""burns the blood,"" and ""cold-blooded"" psychopaths, whose desire ""freezes the blood"".- Erection: As everyone learned in science class, an erection is due to an influx of blood to the blood vessels. But what we didn't all learn in science class, this engorgement also affects women's bodies – the clitoris, vagina and vulva also swell with blood under the effect of desire. From the modest blushing of the cheeks to the turgidity of the genitals, the message is clear: Where there's sex, there's blood. But depending on whether you're a man or a woman, the symbolism is diametrically opposed.- For men: Blood symbolizes virility. There's that which is shed (warrior's blood) and that which flows through the body (as a marker of vigor, especially in the penis). So far, so simple: I have a hard-on, therefore I am (a real male). And yet, new divisions have recently emerged in the locker room realm, fracturing the international masculine standard of triumphant erections. It's time to choose sides: Do you have a tissue-based penis or a blood-based penis? The former is big when flaccid (and doesn't get much bigger when aroused), while the latter doesn't look like much, but can double in size during an erection. To hear men tell it, the vast majority have elastic – or blood-based – penises! It would explain the proverbial extent of their complexes... at least when flaccid.- For women: The blood linked to arousal is completely hidden, and replaced by two traumatic phenomena: menstruation and the loss of virginity. In both cases, the blood represents a taboo.Let's start with menstruation. For a long time, it was linked to sexual prohibitions, the legacy of which we still carry around with us today. While fear of sin has been replaced by fear of ruining one's sheets, or by a form of disgust, the result is the same. Nothing prevents intercourse during menstruation (on the contrary, pleasure can relieve the pain) – and yet! In practice, this period often resembles mutual abstinence, something that neither the use of condoms nor the existence of absorbent pads seems able to shake off.",/en/m-le-mag/
Kim Jong Un wore a ushanka in Vladivostok. Does anyone care?,"On September 16, the North Korean leader ended his Russian tour with a stint of military tourism in the country's east.","On September 16, Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader, completed a week of tourism in Russia, in the country's far east. Along with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, he took this opportunity to examine Russia's state-of-the-art military equipment, including a MiG-31 fighter and its Kinjal hypersonic missile system and Tu-160, Tu-95MS and Tu-22M3 bombers. The festivities ended with a lavish meal and a joyful exchange of gifts.Kim was offered a ushanka. But what kind of fur is it made of? Rabbit or muskrat fur models are commonplace. More luxurious fox, marten, or sheep models are also widespread. The ones supplied to Russian soldiers are traditionally made from a synthetic material that Russians mockingly call ""fish fur."" In all likelihood, however, Kim's chapka is made from reindeer fawn fur. Known as ""pijik,"" they are worn by Russian leaders and members of the upper crust.Undeniably spoiled, Kim also received a beautiful dagger, known in Russia as a kinjal. These daggers and their scabbards, richly decorated with gold or silver motifs, sometimes even encrusted with precious stones, have been used as secondary weapons in Russia since ancient times. But the symbolism of this gift goes further. As we have seen, the word kinjal also designates a Russian hypersonic missile, the Kh-47M2 Kinjal. It goes without saying that it is used in the war in Ukraine.Shoigou displayed a broad smile and an extensive collection of military decorations and ranks. On his épaulette were a gold star and a red star encircled by a laurel wreath, which since 2003 have represented the rank of Shoigu, General of the Army, the second-highest in Russia. The top grade, Marshal of the Russian Federation, has only been awarded so far to Igor Sergeyev, an officer who became defense minister in 1997. On his épaulette, Russia's double-headed eagle emblem replaced the red star, the culmination of chic.Speaking of military accouterment, let's note the presence of a man in a T-shirt and zip-up jacket in the background [between Kim and Shoigu]. Casual? Not at all. When he was appointed defense minister in 2012, Shoigou revolutionized the military dress code to facilitate their freedom of movement and thus simplify their day-to-day work. The jacket, shirt and tie were replaced by a simple zip-up jacket and T-shirt, with noticeable results. Look at how free of his movements he is and how happy he looks.",/en/m-le-mag/
How to raise a child in a world of climate change?,"    Ongoing climate change means the end of those carefree days when summers meant freedom. Despite pervasive eco-anxiety, the challenge is to teach our children that there is still time to act. ","The children were standing in the sea. The sky blazed red. The terrace was covered in ashes. The summer vacations were shattered by global warming. These were the scenes taking place this summer in Greece, Sardinia, Sicily, Algeria and Tunisia, territories subject to staggering temperatures, sometimes exceeding 50°C, and engulfed by fires – some of them devastating. There were similar scenes in France, on the coast of the Pyrénées-Orientales, southwestern France, this year, or on the side of the Monts d'Arrée, in Brittany, last summer.It happened while Juliette, 46, was on vacation on Andros, a Greek island in the Cyclades, an archipelago she has been exploring with her partner and their two boys, aged 8 and 6, for the last number of years. One evening, when the oppressive heat had already made the last few days difficult, lights lit up the sky, the origin of which this Parisian doctor couldn't understand. The next morning, the winds carried smoke from fires that were devouring the island of Euboea. Until then, Juliette hadn't realized that this wildlife reservoir was so close to Andros. The smell of fire was intense. ""I thought, well, shit! That morning I felt like I was in the middle of a catastrophe, even if I didn't actually experience it. It's frightening, this unbearable heatwave, these fires that are going to happen again and again,"" she recalled.Juliette quickly made the link between this event and global warming, caused by human activity and responsible for the hottest summer on record. What did she tell her children? ""The boys didn't ask any questions, we didn't say anything, they're small, I didn't want them to stress. What's sad is the end of carefreeness, the idea that they'll never inhabit our planet the way we did,"" she added, noting that the most important thing in her eyes, in her role as a parent, is that her children feel not only ""emotionally secure, but secure in general."" Faced with situations beyond her control, such as heatwaves, fires and ""therefore global warming,"" she admitted to feeling ""so powerless.""Juliette's emotions come as no surprise to professionals investigating the impact of global warming on our psyches and its repercussions on our lives. ""Climate change leads us to experience an existential crisis in our capacities as humans, individuals, couples, families. I get a lot of parents trying to sort out how they feel about it, and it's very difficult for them to know how to talk to their children about it. You have to understand what you're going through before you can open up space to talk about it. If there is a sense of fear, the child will pick it up,"" stressed Charline Schmerber, a psychotherapist. In 2020, she co-founded the Réseau des Professionnels de l'Accompagnement Face à l'Urgence Ecologique (RAFUE, Professional Network for Therapists in the Face of the Environmental Emergency), and she is the author of Petit guide de survie pour les éco-anxieux (""Little Survival Guide for the Eco-anxious""). She has recently developed a free training course for the Carbone 4 consultancy firm, aimed at all audiences. Coming online soon, it should enable those who aren't going to a therapist's office to tackle the ""eco-emotions"" that run through them: anxiety, sadness, guilt, but also combativeness, joy, optimism – a richer palette than eco-anxiety alone.",/en/m-le-mag/
"In Canada, Kenneth Law, the postal serial killer","    Since 2021, the 57-year-old Canadian has allegedly sold online and mailed potentially lethal powder sodium nitrite to thousands of people considering committing suicide. He will appear before the Ontario Court of Justice on Wednesday. ","A deadly, but legal, chemical was being sent by ordinary mail to over 40 countries. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of recipients around the world have used this poison to take their own lives. On the back of these parcels was no name, but the same shipping address: a P.O. Box in Mississauga, a Canadian city of almost 900,000 residents, next to Toronto, Ontario. For the past five months, Canada has been gripped by a sprawling, investigation into the exact number of victims across several continents of its alleged postal serial killer.57-year-old Kenneth Law was arrested by Mississauga Regional Police on May 2, 2023. He was charged with ""counselling or aiding suicide"" in relation to two people in Ontario, a crime punishable under Canadian law by 14 years of imprisonment. Since the summer, 12 other alleged victims, aged between 16 and 36, have been added to his charge sheet in Canada.Police in the US, Italy, New Zealand, Australia and Ireland have also been looking into all suicides that might be linked to Law. In the UK, the National Crime Agency reported in August that it had identified 230 people who had received products sold by Law over the past two years. 88 have died.Ontario investigators suspect this Canadian of having mailed over 1,200 packages of sodium nitrite sachets around the world. This white crystalline powder – used as an additive in the preservation of meats and cured meats, under the code E250 – has turned out to be a frighteningly effective poison if ingested in high doses.By reducing oxygen levels and impairing breathing, it can lead rapidly to death. Since 2021, several teams of American, British and Italian toxicologists have published studies showing that ingesting sodium nitrite is becoming an increasingly widespread suicide method, particularly among 15-39 year-olds who use the internet as their main source of information.On his still-active LinkedIn profile, Law, wearing small round glasses, describes himself as an ""executive"" with an engineering degree and an MBA in marketing and international business. He makes no mention of his most recent professional experience: a brief stint as a cook in a luxury hotel in Toronto, where, according to the police, he discovered this ""food salt,"" and where to buy it.Since the end of 2020, on several websites registered in his name, he allegedly offered for sale 50-gram packs of sodium nitrite, with an advertised purity of ""99.999%,"" for 59 Canadian dollars (€40). Customers could also order masks and gas inhalers, perfect ""suicide kits,"" according to the police.",/en/m-le-mag/
How do you talk to children about pedophilia?,    Parents struggle to find the right words to talk about sexual violence. ,"On one recent evening, we suggested to our eldest daughter, aged 8, that she should go to camp for the next vacation. She was quite keen, if only to taunt her younger siblings. After this exchange, my partner and I realized the obvious. We were going to have to have the uncomfortable conversation with her that haunts many parents. How do we talk to our child about sexual violence and the risk of pedophilia? How can we avoid terrorizing her or giving her the false impression that evil is everywhere? And at the same time, how can we say what needs to be said?Your first instinct may be to bury your head in the sand, but unfortunately this is neither effective nor very responsible. Your second reflex may be to tell yourself I've already ""done the job."" During bath time, in preparation for sleepovers and a previous stay at camp, I repeatedly told my children that their bodies belonged to them and that no one had the right to touch them if they didn't agree. As a result, my youngest, aged 4, spent weeks shouting at anyone who would listen that I'd cut her bangs without her consent, even though her body belonged to her. She then applied the same system to eating zucchini.Your third reflex can be to look for resources. In this case, I didn't have to go far. I'm lucky enough to receive children's books because I review them for Le Monde. On Saturday, my youngest daughter, now aged 5, pounced on the armchair and said, ""Mommy, I want you to read this to us!""The book in question was a new title in Milan's Mes P'tits Pourquoi (""My Little Whys"") collection, soberly entitled: L'Inceste (""Incest""), addressing a specific but frequent situation of sexual violence. It provided the necessary opportunity to speak about it. So, after a bout of nervous laughter and an exchange of glances with their dad, I let the little troupe (8, 5 and 3 years old) crowd around me to prepare for what they thought would be yet another story about a lost blankie. You know how sometimes you can hear the quality of silence? Well, I can guarantee that I could hear their silence, as I told them the story of Plume and her ""uncle,"" ""who looks gentle and kind."" The book names acts and emotions with precision and clarity; it tries to draw a line between the cuddles that children need, and those that make them ""uncomfortable."" It anticipates their fears and questions, and sets out the framework of the law and seeks to relieve victims of their guilt.While I was reading, my eldest daughter reacted only once, when ""uncle was in prison"" at the end. ""In prison?!"" she exclaimed. ""Is it really that serious?"" In her eyes, the subject of sexual violence (which can also come from adults other than those in the family, I pointed out to them) suddenly passed from the register of the intimate to the judicial register, with all the solemnity conferred by a book.",/en/m-le-mag/
"How to deal with too many tourists: Lessons from Venice, Machu Pichu and Lascaux","    Venice recently decided to introduce a tax on day visitors in 2024. In recent years, the number of tourist locations implementing measures to combat overtourism has increased. ","A publicity stunt or a real solution to prevent tourist overflow? On September 12, Venice's city council voted in favor of a €5 tax for temporary visitors – those who don't stay overnight in the City of the Doges. The measure will be tested in the spring and summer of 2024 for around 30 days. In 2020, the mayor had already promised to create gates, a paid entrance system and the introduction of mandatory reservations to visit the city's historic center, which has been overrun by tourists (up to 100,000 a day in summer). But Venice ultimately didn't follow through. In late July, UNESCO considered putting Venice on its World Heritage in Danger list, deeming the measures taken so far to be ""insufficient.""Two years after mandating the presence of professional guides for tourists in order to better supervise and preserve Machu Picchu, in January 2019, the Peruvian authorities decided to restrict visiting hours to a maximum of four hours a day. The wear and tear on the stones of this jewel of Inca history owe as much to natural erosion as to the roughly one million annual visitors. In May 2019, the window was even reduced to three hours for the Temples of the Condor and of the Sun and the pyramid of Intihuatana. After the Covid-19 crisis, the introduction of daily visitor quotas – initially set at 4,000 and then 5,000 – irritated shopkeepers and tourists alike.Its fame nearly led to its demise. Popularized by Danny Boyle's film The Beach (2000), Maya Bay, on the island of Phi Phi Ley in southern Thailand, was closed in June 2018 by the country's authorities. Biologists have warned of the disappearance of coral reefs and underwater life in this idyllic setting. Attracted by its white sand, turquoise waters and cliffs, around 5,000 tourists flocked here every day as the boats of tour operators came in one behind the other. For over three years, access to the bay was forbidden. Coral was replanted and species like blacktip sharks were reintroduced. In 2022, the bay reopened, but swimming was prohibited.In the early 1990s, the Pointe du Raz, with half a million annual visitors, feared the waves of tourists more than those of the ocean. The trampling of visitors was threatening the most famous of all Breton capes, destroying its grass and plants. The cape had lost its charm after concrete stores and crêperies were hastily built in the 1960s. In the mid-1990s, the state-owned Conservatoire du Littoral bought up the land and negotiated with hundreds of owners to bulldoze the shops and rebuild them further out. The operation cost over 50 million francs (€11.2 million).In 1963, French Minister of Culture André Malraux announced that the Lascaux caves would temporarily close. ""Prehistory's Sistine Chapel,"" discovered by a walker in 1940, was afflicted by a mysterious ""green disease."" Tiny algae had been mushrooming on the walls for the past three years. Scientists were called in to help. They concluded that this Mecca of Upper Palaeolithic art, opened to the public in 1948, was suffering from over-tourism. The cave's lighting and the breathing of visitors (122,250 in 1962) threatened the over 15,000-year-old paintings. Lascaux was never reopened to the public. Since then, several replicas have been built, including Lascaux 2 in 1983.",/en/m-le-mag/
'USA Today' counts on Taylor Swift and Beyoncé to revive its business,"    Gannett, an American media conglomerate, is hiring two reporters to exclusively cover news about the two singers, a move criticized as a marketing ploy to divert attention from reduced local coverage. ","""Sound like the job of your wildest dreams? You could be the 1,"" tweeted the national daily USA Today, flagship of the Gannett group, also owner of over 200 local newspapers.While nothing is stopping fans of the two artists from applying, the positions are intended for professionals who will work for USA Today and The Tennessean, a regional title based in Nashville (Tennessee), where Taylor Swift began her country music career. ""Swift's fanbase has grown to unprecedented heights, and so has the significance of her music and growing legacy,"" said Gannett in the ad. The Beyoncé ad states that she ""has been a force in everything from how the country views race to how women think about their partners.""In the first case, the reporter will need to be a ""creative and energetic journalist able to capture the excitement around Swift's ongoing tour and upcoming album release, while also providing thoughtful analysis of her music and career."" The second job description calls for an ""energetic and enterprising writer, capable of a text and video-forward approach, who can capture Beyoncé Knowles-Carter’s effect not only on the many industries in which she operates, but also on society.""While it is not uncommon for some journalists to be assigned to cover celebrities, particularly politicians, it is less usual for artists. ""Our role at the USA TODAY Network is to cover the newsmakers who impact lives across the nation (...) and provide our audience the content they crave,"" said Gannett. More than anything, this demonstrates the economic and cultural power these two women represent.With her first albums re-recorded to recover the rights, Swift continues to capture the top of the charts. Her world tour, The Eras Tour, is a phenomenal success. As The New York Times wrote, by the end of the tour, which includes 146 dates through to 2024, ticket sales ""could reach $1.4 billion [€1.3 billion] or more,"" outperforming Elton John's farewell tour, the current record holder. To satisfy the insatiable appetite of the ""Swifties"" – the singer's fans – a film devoted to the star's concerts is scheduled to hit cinema screens in mid-October. The theater chain AMC Theatres, which is about to release the film, has recorded its biggest-ever ticket pre-sales: $26 million (€24.3 million) in tickets were sold in a single day.Beyoncé is not to be outdone. With her Renaissance World Tour, which ends in North America in October, she is also playing sold-out stadiums, to which the lucky ones who have managed to get a seat flock in tight silver outfits, cowboy hats and boots of the same color, just like their idol on stage.",/en/m-le-mag/
"In Sweden, censorship hovers above the ghosts of the Iranian Resistance",    The city of Borås has decided not to showcase Sadaf Ahmadi's sculptures for security reasons. The Tehran-born artist wished to denounce through her work the regime's repressive discourses against women. ,"She is still in shock, stunned by the decision; Once again, she can sense the ""shadow"" floating over her, a shadow that haunted her all her life, and from which she thought she would finally be freed by leaving Iran. Three years ago, Sadaf Ahmadi emigrated to Sweden with her husband. Since then, the artist born in Tehran in 1985 has lived in Borås, a town of 114,000 inhabitants, some 60 kilometers east of Gothenburg. On September 16, the first anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death in Iran, she was due to present two exhibitions at the town's cultural center. But, 10 days before the opening, the municipality decided to cancel one of them, for security reasons.The banned works consist of a dozen veiled women's faces, sculpted in concrete and suspended from the ceiling by a wire. In an interview with local newspaper Borås Tidning, director of culture Ida Burén justified her decision by citing ""the general security situation"" in Sweden. On August 17, intelligence services raised the terrorist alert level from three to four on its five-point scale. A few days earlier, Al-Qaeda had encouraged Muslims in Europe to ""take revenge"" against the Scandinavian kingdom for the Qurans burned there since the start of the year.Against this backdrop, explained Ida Burén, the fact that the exhibition had ""religious themes, since the garment is a Muslim one, could lead to the work being interpreted in the same way as, or associated with, the burning of the Quran."" Her security colleagues had also noted ""the explosive potential"" of the work, she said.Reached by telephone, Ahmadi confided her sadness and anger. ""I felt like I was back in Iran. It's the same censorship, justified by the same arguments, according to which certain things are not acceptable, because they may hurt believers. Many Iranian artists are in prison because they have exercised their freedom of expression and defied this censorship. But I didn't expect such a reaction from Sweden.""In Iran, Ahmadi studied film, then worked as an actress and made several short films in which she denounced the violation of women's rights. In exile in Sweden, unable to understand the language of her host country, she decided she would have to find another artistic language. While working as a caretaker at a school in Borås, she began to take an interest in concrete, a material she loves, without really being able to explain why, although she is aware of its symbolic power.Coincidentally, just before his arrival in Sweden in November 2019, former Iranian prosecutor Hamid Nouri was arrested in Stockholm. In May 2022, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the massacre of thousands of political prisoners in Iran in 1988. She then recalled that the victims were not allowed a funeral: ""Their bodies were thrown into mass graves covered in concrete.""",/en/m-le-mag/
The Gilberto legend: Bossa nova was born out of this family of bohemian brilliance,Long Read,"In Rio, the Atlantic Ocean can be furious, beautiful and wild. At such times, it allows no one to venture into its waves. It barely lets anyone touch its vast foam. The eight kilometers of beach in Rio's Zona Sul – Leme, Copacabana, Ipanema and Leblon – stretch roughly from the Sugar Loaf to the rocky tip of Vidigal, a favela that glows with a thousand lights come nightfall. There is a type of music that has provided the rhythmic and joyful heartbeat of this urban jungle, dominated by hills and forest: bossa nova. And there's a family that has sung it and guided it to a trans-American destiny: the Gilbertos.The patriarch of this dynasty was João Gilberto, the inventor of bossa nova – along with Antônio Carlos ""Tom"" Jobim and Vinícius de Moraes – who died in 2019 at the age of 88. His first wife, the 83-year-old singer Astrud Gilberto, known worldwide as the elegant embodiment of ""The Girl from Ipanema"" and the voice behind this global hit, passed away in June, in Philadelphia where she lived. Bebel Gilberto, his daughter with his second wife, Miúcha, was born in New York in 1966. At the end of August, she released her seventh album, entitled João, a refined and glowing tribute to her father.""I've been working with my family for a long time now,"" said a smiling Bebel, whose real name is Isabel, on her American summer tour. She was accompanied by her Yorkshire terrier named Ella in honor of jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald. There, she reminisced about a childhood memory, the evening of July 4, 1975, at New York's Avery Fisher Hall. She was nine years old, with dark, curly hair and intense eyes. Miúcha, her mother, was backstage with the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, ""a very kind gentleman,"" who found the child's dimples amusing.The great saxophonist Stan Getz was on stage. Her dad was supposed to join him. But he didn't want to. Bebel couldn't remember why. She only remembered the pat on the back, the ""You go, you!"" that propelled her onto the stage. She didn't know what to do. She started singing, joined by her mother. The next day, The New York Times would rave about the debutante's performance, thrust into the limelight somewhat abruptly.That day, the little girl became a Gilberto, one of the members of this brilliant and sometimes tumultuous lineage. This family's trajectory followed the evolution of Brazil, in the same way as the Gainsbourg-Birkin family embodied the spirit of freedom that swept through France in the 1970s. The Gilbertos epitomized an artistic, enlightened and highly cultured Carioca bohemia, enriched by the arts and humanities. There were also plenty of romantic and friendly passions, along with some eccentricity. With finely crafted words and sophisticated material, they knew how to build worldwide success.",/en/m-le-mag/
Who is Labour Party leader Keir Starmer?,"    The UK opposition leader met with Emmanuel Macron at the Elysée Palace on September 19. With one year left before the general election, the former human rights lawyer is strategically positioning himself as a potential future prime minister. ","With one year to go before the general election, Keir Starmer is refining his image as a potential future prime minister. On September 19, the 61-year-old leader of the British Labour opposition met with President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysée Palace, a few days after visits to Canada and the Netherlands. The Conservative majority was annoyed at France's departure from custom – a leader usually only meets the head of another country's opposition if they are from their own political camp. However, not many Tories believe in the possibility of victory: Labour is at least 15 points ahead in the polls. The British people seem weary of 13 years of Tory rule, the scandals of the Boris Johnson era and the disastrous tenure of Liz Truss.Elected as a member of parliament in 2015, Keir Starmer applies the same discipline to politics as to when he was director of public prosecutions for England and Wales. After replacing Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in April 2020, Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, removed all those who refused to take anti-Semitism allegations seriously, including Corbyn himself. He then neutralized potential rivals and those without sufficient experience of power. His critics say they have difficulty understanding his convictions, and believe he is more in it to win than to defend ideas.In order to have a chance of getting into power, Labour must position itself in the center, and this is what Starmer has done. He has marginalized the left wing of the party (the Corbynistas) and developed policies marked by budgetary discipline and a firm line on immigration and security. He has promised to get rid of laws limiting the right to strike but he refuses to make a commitment to an increase in social security benefits. Even his plan to invest in the green economy (€32 billion per year) has been revised downwards. He refuses to openly stand with the labor unions and denounces climate activists when they cause disruption.The MP with thick hair and piercing eyes likes to talk about his humble origins: his working-class father and mother who was a nurse, both Labour activists, named him after James Keir Hardie, one of the founders of Labour in 1893. Starmer was not privately educated, unlike Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, or previous Conservative leaders. And he's the first in his family to have gone to university: he studied law at Leeds and then Oxford. He has only one avowed passion: football. He plays for an amateur club in north London and is a staunch supporter of Arsenal. In fact, he presented Emmanuel Macron with an Arsenal shirt when they met.",/en/m-le-mag/
Japan's Ghibli Park celebrates Hayao Miyazaki's kaleidoscopic imagination,Series,"""Take a stroll, feel the wind and discover the wonders."" Eight months after it opened in early November 2022, the invitation issued by Parc Ghibli's marketing team elicited numerous responses.Located not far from Nagoya in central Japan, the venue has been struggling to cope with the influx of fans eager to immerse themselves in the multicolored fantasy of the animated films belonging to the famous studio created in 1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki. It was christened ""Ghibli,"" an Italian word derived from the Arabic word for a warm wind blowing over Libya, to reflect Miyazaki's desire to breathe new life into Japanese animation. From its very first productions, far removed from the creations of Disney that Miyazaki found too consensual, the studio won over local audiences with its demanding craftsmanship, poetry and themes touching on the Japanese imagination and tinged with animism. These qualities also apply to Ghibli Park.Once they get past the elevator tower, with its late-19th century sci-fi aesthetic and which is featured in films like Castle in the Sky (1986) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), visitors can access three areas: the Grand Warehouse, which contains references to several feature films; the Dondoko Forest from My Neighbor Totoro (1988); and the Hill of Youth, based on the film Whisper of the Heart (1995). They will soon be joined by two new areas: Mononoke Village, inspired by the film Princess Mononoke (1997), in the Fall of 2023, and the Valley of Witches, inspired by Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), in March 2024.Reservations have to be made weeks in advance and visitors must choose their schedule and stick to it, queuing on arrival before they can enter the lair of Chihiro, Ponyo and Pompoko, all characters brought to life by the studio's brilliant pencils.The park covers 7.1 hectares of the 157-hectare Moricoro Park, which hosted the 2005 World Expo. Built thanks to a 34 billion yen (approx. €220 million) investment by Aichi Prefecture, it is managed by Ghibli Park Co, a company jointly created by Studio Ghibli and the Chunichi Shimbun press group. Its operators expect 1.8 million visitors a year, and 48 billion yen in annual revenue, mostly from accommodation and tourism.Given the number of visitors in the first few months, there's little doubt their objectives will be met despite the park being rather difficult to access. Built while respecting its environment, its website warns that it features ""no big attractions or rides."" In 2022, Studio Ghibli's Executive Director Toshio Suzuki explained that the project was based on the spirit of the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo, but four times larger.",/en/m-le-mag/
The pain of forced queer exile through the lens of Jake Naughton,In pictures,"The story told by American photographer Jake Naughton's images, taken over four years and in three countries (Kenya, Uganda and the United States), is not immediately obvious. Naughton's enigmatically-titled series This Is How the Heart Beats features portraits, close-ups of parts of a face, a hand, a rosary and embraces on a bed. It all began in 2014, when Uganda introduced a bill crudely dubbed ""Kill the Gays"" in the Western media. It made those who have homosexual relations liable to the death penalty in the event of repeat offenses or doing so knowing they carry HIV. The bill was declared unconstitutional due to the lack of a necessary quorum in terms of the number of MPs participating in the vote.There was a new development to this repression through legislation at the end of May, with the enactment of a law considered by LGBTQ+ rights organizations to be one of the most repressive in the world. It stipulates, for instance, that anyone ""knowingly promoting homosexuality"" faces up to 20 years in prison. It also forces all Ugandan citizens to report anyone they presume to be homosexual. Further, conversion therapies and drug prescriptions aimed at changing a person's sexual orientation or gender identity have been introduced. And finally, a provision makes ""aggravated homosexuality"" (recidivism) a capital offense.In 2014, Naughton – then a freelance photojournalist – was sent to Kenya for five days, paired with journalist Jacob Kushner, to follow LGBTQ+ refugees, mainly Ugandans fleeing persecution. ""Kenya is not a panacea for sexual minorities,"" said Naughton. ""But the UN High Commission had a strong presence here, and people came from all over East and Central Africa to find refuge."" The two men gathered so many testimonies, and of such complexity, that they decided to continue this work.""At the same time, Kenya was experiencing a wave of xenophobia and homophobia,"" said Naughton. ""The exiles we photographed were caught in the crossfire."" Back then, much was written about Uganda's legislative ambitions, but there was little coverage of the living conditions of the people on the ground. Naughton and Kushner documented the hotbeds of LGBTQ+ resistance and the survival of an underground queer community. ""It was a vicious circle,"" said the photographer. ""Because they were notoriously oppressed, LGBTQ+ Ugandans had gained international visibility and support from embassies and NGOs. But the more visible they were, the worse the repression became.""",/en/m-le-mag/

They have lost a revered elder, a magnificent sycamore maple, which was hacked down on the night of September 27 in a blatant act of vandalism. The deciduous tree was planted in a dramatic dip between two hills, at the foot of Hadrian's Wall, built by the Romans in the 2nd century to protect themselves from the tribes that dwelled in the northern realms, in what is present-day Scotland. The tree had withstood the elements and human madness for over two centuries. Its lofty silhouette had become legendary after appearing in the film Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves (1991), starring Kevin Costner. Hikers and amateur photographers alike relished the dramatic effect evoked by its thick foliage against a backdrop of tormented skies.All over the country, the reactions of sadness and anger were in keeping with the affection this great tree aroused. Bouquets, single flowers and emotional notes were laid beside the stump, and the news media filmed live broadcasts there. ""People have been so horrified by it. Everyone, from the urban center of Newcastle to rural areas, has been so shocked that someone would do something so brutal to a piece of nature,"" reacted Helen-Ann Hartley, the Anglican bishop of Newcastle, the nearest city. While police initially interviewed a 16-year-old boy and then a 69-year-old man, and seized a chainsaw from a farm near the wall, they are refusing to give further details of the ongoing investigation and possible motives for this ecocide.The sycamore maple was a source of pride for people in this county, at one time an Anglo-Saxon kingdom and then an industrial powerhouse, now one of the poorest regions in the UK. ""People have gone there and it brought joy to them, people have left their ashes there when they’ve died, they’ve got married there, and all kinds of lovely events have taken place,"" said Brian Blessed, the actor who played Lord Locksley in Robin Hood.This act of brazen vandalism is ""unbearable,"" said author and historian Dan Jackson, from Northumberland. "" I haven’t felt a loss like this since the medieval beams of Notre Dame came crashing down in 2019,"" he added. On a more positive note, Andrew Poad, head of the National Trust (the British charity responsible for preserving historic monuments and sites), said that the stump remained ""healthy"" and that shoots could reappear.The outpouring of emotion from the British speaks volumes about their attachment to trees, which also occupy a special place in Celtic tales and myths, particularly the oak, the tree of the Druids, symbol of power and gateway to the other world. It is common for people to post their ""tree of the day"" on social networks, as they travel around the country. BBC Radio 4 devoted the month of June to gathering listeners' testimonials about their ""favorite tree,"" and the Woodland Trust, the leading association dedicated to the conservation of Britain's woodland heritage, organizes an annual competition to find the country's most beautiful specimen.",/en/m-le-mag/
"Fabien Galthié in Le Monde, from rebel scrum-half to esteemed coach for the French national team","After defeating New Zealand, the French rugby team has kept an unbroken winning streak ahead of their crucial match against Italy on Friday and their coach has played a major role. Le Monde has been following his lifetime of rugby since June 13, 1991.","Fabien Galthié couldn't have made a better start to his World Cup coaching career. But, after France's 27-13 victory over New Zealand – which is no small rugby nation – on Friday, September 8, Galthié preferred to remain levelheaded: ""There are areas for improvement, but having come through this match and emerged victorious will do us good."" Having participated in four editions of the tournament as a player, including one losing final (1999), the coach knew that the competition, which runs until October 28, still had a long way to go.It was on the eve of a World Cup partly organized by France that Galthié first appeared in Le Monde's pages, on June 13, 1991. At the edge of a news item, readers learned, without further details, that this ""scrum-half from Colomiers"" had been selected by Les Bleus for a friendly match against Romania. In October 1991, at the start of the world's biggest rugby gathering, Philippe Broussard detailed the characteristics of scrum-halves, those number 9s who are ""privileged witnesses of [the] confrontation between the packs."" The journalist then turned to the words of the ""youngest member of the French team."" Aged 22, Galthié explained: ""It's a creative position. You're constantly asked to take the initiative.""The task was not always an easy one, and Les Bleus got off to a mixed start, being eliminated in the quarterfinals. ""Young Fabien Galthié found it very difficult to 'take over' [Pierre] Berbizier's legacy as scrum-half,"" Broussard said harshly after the French team's first match. But he praised his performance in the next match, saying he was ""an excellent organizer of the game.""Subsequently, Le Monde covered Galthié's early career sparingly. Certainly, in May 1992, journalist Bénédicte Mathieu mentioned his role in the ""beautiful adventure"" of US Colomiers, a small club from the Toulouse suburbs that had reached the quarterfinals of the French championship for the first time in its history. But his six-month contract in 1995 with a South African club in Cape Town, an unusual experience at the time, was mentioned only in passing, as were some of his injuries. That year, after the withdrawal of several players, at the last moment Galthié took part in the World Cup, organized... in South Africa.In 1999, after an unsuccessful Les Bleus tour of the Southern Hemisphere, he was left out of the French national team on the eve of another World Cup. But then scrum-half Pierre Mignoni was injured. In a repeat, doors opened at the last minute. Galthié put aside the very real bitterness of his initial ousting and became one of the architects of Les Bleus' fine run to the semifinals, where they beat the All Blacks.",/en/m-le-mag/
"Cronuts, plumcots, brookies... The endless variety of hybrid food products in the United States","Some products and practices, born in the United States, are spreading around the globe. In her column, Le Monde's Guillemette Faure examines the new trend of viral hybrid food items.","In the last few weeks, Trader Joe's stores have stocked their shelves with Plumcots. ""The shape and aroma of an apricot [apricot] with the flavor of a plum [plum],"" promises the in-store display for the fruit sold at $3.79 per pound (about €8 a kilo). Not to be confused with the Pluots and Apriums sold elsewhere, which contain more apricots than plums.In a nearby section, the now-well-established brookies (a layer of brownie under a layer of chocolate chip cookie), are not to be confused with other brookies that blend brioche and cookie. Hybrid products may be nothing new, but the field of combinations has been continually expanding. Brooklyn Dumpling Shop, for instance, offers specialty dumplings filled with mac and cheese, pizza or cheeseburger.The first particularly viral hybrid food product – the Cronut, a croissant-donut from New York-based French pastry chef Dominique Ansel that still has people queuing up outside its Soho store – is now ten years old and has opened the door to a host of more or less convincing crossbreed ideas: Croffles (half-croissant, half-waffle), Cruffin (croissant-muffins available at Deli Robuchon) and Scuffin (scone and muffin).The United States doesn't have a monopoly on dubious crossovers, whether it's speculos eclairs or the strange idea of the restaurant chain Léon's to offer mussels with raclette a few months ago (we won't mention here French tacos, which never even tried to look like real tacos). But the sheer variety of cuisines that can be found in the US has given Americans a broader base to work with to create questionable combos – including the sushi burrito.In a recent Wall Street Journal article on the French craze for American takeaway cuisine, chef Braden Perkins of Verjus restaurant in Paris explained that Americans are ""not afraid to work across different spectrums and create new dishes, like Korean tacos"" because they keep in mind that ""the 'wrong' way might produce something interesting, even delicious.""There are surely other reasons for the rise of hybrid food products. They're easier to pitch to management at R&D meetings (imagine an apricot, but with the skin of a plum) than a product that doesn't resemble anything familiar. A hybrid product promises novelty but no unknowns. In a famous experiment, though never replicated scientifically, Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper, two researchers from Columbia and Stanford Universities, offered in-store jam tastings: On some days, 24 flavors were made available; on others, only six. It turned out that the customers who most often bought the products were those who had the least choice, namely the range of six.",/en/m-le-mag/
Laundry detergents and ice cream under lock and key in American supermarkets,"Some products and practices, born in the United States, are spreading around the globe. In her column, Le Monde's Guillemette Faure examined the new trend of locking away everything from coffee to exfoliating shower sponges.","Anyone would think we'd asked for a bottle of champagne, when all we wanted was a packet of coffee, which was inaccessible because it was displayed behind glass under lock and key. A shop assistant had to open it up to free a packet for us. The price of raw materials has, of course, soared in recent years, but inflation doesn't explain everything. In some American supermarkets and drug stores, items such as shampoo, men's socks and detergent can only be bought by asking a sales assistant to open the display case for you.Self-service stores, which were an American innovation, are now seeing the pendulum swing back, with aisles entirely under lock and key. There are no sales assistants, but you can usually press a button next to the window to summon someone. And yes, I've seen an employee unlock a display shelf for a woman to grab a $2.99 exfoliating shower sponge.A sign on the display window in the men's socks department of a Target store in Manhattan, doesn't say: ""To prevent theft, we've locked everything up."" Instead, they have: ""To maintain our inventory levels, this section requires the assistance of a team member,"" or ""Secure shelves keep products in stock so you can shop."" The entire toothpaste section is behind glass. A man in front of me asked: ""Do people even steal toothpaste these days?""It's not always what's most expensive that is locked away, but what's easiest to sell on, which is what the store Giant in Washington DC said to justify its decision not to sell certain brands, such as Colgate toothpaste and Tide laundry detergent. Clearly, private-label brands are less easy to resell.Items such as vitamins, Red Bull and ice cream are often under lock and key. In Manhattan's Fairway stores, Häagen-Dazs ice cream is sold with an anti-theft device on the lid. And so, the world now has engineers whose research and development departments require them to work on anti-theft devices designed to prevent a 400 g bucket of ice cream from being opened.In the same stores, a large padlock has been put on the dietary supplement shelves. Never have chain stores been so aptly named. Perhaps all the padlocks could have boosted shopping – after all, they could make you feel like you're Place Vendôme, surrounded by all those luxury products displayed in the windows: Shampoo! Deodorant! Paracetamol! The truth is you feel more like a would-be thief. This ruins all the efforts made by supermarkets to make us believe that cashiers are team players, that sales assistants are advisers, and that shopping is ""an experience.""",/en/m-le-mag/
'A man who devotes part of his time to his children or parents is transgressing powerful stereotypes',"In an op-ed, Clotilde Coron and Emmanuelle Garbe, professor and lecturer in management science, note that men who take paid paternity leave have their careers penalized.","More and more often, the celebrity pages of magazines feature famous actors or sportsmen with their muscular figures, dark glasses and babies in their arms. In parks, young fathers are often seen deftly steering pushchairs, seemingly without endangering their masculinity. Is it now socially acceptable to be a father and look after your young children in day-to-day life?Paid paternity leave, created in 2002 and extended to 25 days in 2021, helped strengthen the bonds between fathers and their offspring. But our research (""Deviation from the ideal worker norm and lower career success expectations: A 'men's issue' too?,"" by Clotilde Coron and Emmanuelle Garbe, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 2023) shows the resilience of stereotypes in the professional sector.For men, taking time out from work to spend with their children remains a high-risk choice despite the idealized image of happy fatherhood. Very few of them dare to do so. Today, only 1% opt for voluntary part-time work to look after their families, whether young children or elderly parents losing their independence.Twice as many men switch to part-time work to take a second job or train than to look after their family, and those who take time off to pursue a hobby also outnumber those who want to look after their children or parents!Our research helps to understand this reluctance. Existing research shows that the careers of the approximately 30% of women who work part-time (half of them for family reasons) are penalized, with lower hourly wages, more difficulties in accessing leadership roles and lower quality positions than their full-time counterparts. Men who choose to spend their time with their families are no less penalized than women; on the contrary, they are doubly so.As with the women who use these facilities, managers are beginning to doubt their professional commitment. If they want time for their families, their dedication to the company is bound to be questioned by their superiors.But it goes further than that. Men who choose to work part-time to look after their loved ones are not conforming to what is expected of a man. Attitudes have evolved less than we think: For 35% of people in the European Union, a man's priority is to earn money and a woman's is to look after the home and family. While the vast majority of European women (68%) work full-time, this ""choice"" is still considered by one in two Europeans to be to the detriment of the family.This division of labor between women and men is relatively recent, as it is linked to the development of large industrial corporations in the early 20th century. This is when paid labor left the traditional domestic sphere, where until then it had been normal for everyone, men and women, to participate, whether on the farm or in the workshop.",/en/m-le-mag/
BNP Paribas: 'Leader of the energy transition' or bank of a 'burning world'?,"    France’s leading bank claims to be 'green,' but is regularly targeted by environmental NGOs, which denounce certain practices that are far from its commitments. ","For months now, BNP Paribas has been the target of environmental activists who believe that its policies ""condemn the climate,"" as proclaimed on a banner displayed in October 2022 on the steps of the Palais Brongniart, for Climate Finance Day.A milestone was reached when the French bank was sued for its financing of fossil fuels on February 23. At the helm are the non-governmental organizations Our Business, Oxfam and Friends of the Earth, which hope to bring about a ""historic"" trial. For many, the ""bank for a changing world,"" as its motto claims, has become the symbol of a ""burning world."" But is this right or wrong?While BNP Paribas estimates its direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1.65 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year and per employee, its carbon footprint goes much further. Banks are key players in the economy and finance many companies that pollute the environment.To limit this impact, financiers can direct their funds toward low-carbon activities. BNP Paribas believes it is ahead of the game in this area. Its CEO, Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, claims BNP's status as a ""leader of the energy transition."" According to him, the bank has already ""largely"" committed to ""moving away from fossil fuels.""The bank told Le Monde that it finances more low-carbon energy production than fossil fuels. At the end of September 2022, its outstanding loans linked to renewables, biofuel and nuclear were €28.2 billion, compared to €23.7 billion for oil, coal and gas. This is better than its main American and Asian rivals, it assured, referring in particular to a recent comparison by Bloomberg, which places it largely ahead of all major global banks. BNP Paribas is also proud to have supported projects such as the Swedish ""gigafactory"" for electric batteries in Northvolt, which opened at the end of 2022.However, another reality emerges from Banking on Climate Chaos, a reference report published each year by seven NGOs. In 2022, BNP remained the European institution that supported fossil fuels the most, with $20.1 billion (€18.43 billion) in financing, up 22% year-on-year, according to its latest report, released on Thursday, April 13. Since the 2016 Paris Agreement, the French bank has provided fossil fuel majors with more than $166 billion (€151 billion), even ranking as the world’s largest financier of Shell or BP.This discrepancy is due in particular to several indirect financing operations that BNP Paribas does not include in its environmental balance sheet, starting with the issuing of bonds. This service, which consists of helping a company issue securities to investors in return for a commission, is substantial and is not accompanied by any particular environmental constraints. The NGO Reclaim Finance noted that in February, BNP Paribas participated in the issuance of a $4.5 billion (more than €4.1 billion) bond package for Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, alongside France’s Crédit Agricole, Société Générale and Natixis. Unlike its loans, BNP does not quantify how much of its bonds finance fossil fuels.",/en/investigations/
The downfall of Paris' mysterious luxury real estate owner,Investigation,"Monday, March 6, was supposed to be a great day for Adrien Labi. The British businessman was in Paris to finalize a major real estate deal with Kering. The French luxury giant headed by François-Henri Pinault had agreed to pay the astronomical sum of one billion euros to buy two buildings located on Avenue Montaigne in Paris' 8th arrondissement, where property prices are among the highest in the capital. A lucrative deal for Labi, who more than doubled his initial wager when he bought the buildings eight years ago.Yet euphoria soon gave way to stupor after the sale was signed. Upon leaving the notary's office, he was arrested by agents of the Brigade Nationale de Répression de la Délinquance Fiscale (National Fiscal Offenses Repression Brigade, BNRDF) and placed in police custody. This improbable development marked the end of 20 years of real estate adventures during which Labi's name could be heard as often in the affluent Parisian districts as in the courts.The spotlight first fell on the man nicknamed the ""Ghost"" of Paris' prestigious neighborhood in the 8th arrondissement, known as the ""Golden Triangle,"" in 2015. An investigation by Le Monde's magazine M brought to light the vast prestigious real estate portfolio in this posh area of Paris' hyper-center, worth hundreds of millions of euros, held by this businessman unknown to the public at large. Yet Labi was already a very familiar figure to the French tax authorities, who started taking an interest in his dealings in the mid-2000s. Riddled with tax audits, his companies were forced to pay millions of euros in tax adjustments, but the ""ghost"" refused and exploited every possible legal recourse to avoid doing so.Slowly, however, the noose tightened as tax authorities referred the most serious cases to the courts. The first judicial investigation was dismissed in 2010. Two years later, the Paris Criminal Court sentenced a company that was part of Labi's empire for tax fraud for the first time. Tempolux was found guilty of having moved four Parisian properties between several companies in Luxembourg and France ""exclusively for tax purposes"" to dodge four million euros in capital gains taxes. Labi, who was not officially linked to any of these companies, managed to slip away. His daughter Clarissa, on the other hand, was sentenced to two years in prison as manager of Tempolux. The court noted that it ""appears highly probable"" that she ""was not the sole perpetrator.""",/en/investigations/
Colombia: The murder of journalist Rafael Moreno and the corruption he exposed,    The investigative consortium Forbidden Stories has continued the work of a reporter who was killed in 2022 while investigating suspected clientelism in public contracts. ,"""If you want to kill me, kill me. But I'll tell you straight up: you won't silence me."" In a 37-minute video that was broadcast live on Facebook on July 21, 2022, journalist Rafael Moreno vigorously condemned the embezzlement of public money he was investigating in the province of Cordoba, in northern Colombia. With supporting evidence, he cited contracts that he believed were artificially inflated, mentioned work that was never completed, named companies and showed his determination. ""They are stealing from the municipality,"" he said, adding that someone has to highlight the wrongdoing. He wore a cap and a white polo shirt bearing the name of his media outlet, Voces de Cordoba (""The Voice of Cordoba"").This province, where he lived, is a strategic corridor of the drug trafficking route. The 2016 peace agreements with the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) have not put an end to civil unrest or corruption scandals, which the journalist made his specialty, almost to the point of obsession. On the Facebook page for his media company, which he launched in 2018, Moreno didn't spare anyone. His 56,000 subscribers didn't miss a single detail of the scandals he exposed almost daily, which concerned local politicians as well as mining companies and paramilitary groups. His tone, which was particularly scathing, had earned him a local notoriety that left him vulnerable.In his video dated July 21, the 37-year-old journalist talked about the last threat he received, found on July 2 in the trunk of his motorcycle: Facing the camera, he held a bullet from a revolver, accompanied by an anonymous note. ""You now know that we know every move you make (...) We know everything about you. We are not going to forgive you for what you do. So you know, my friend, that the rest of the magazine of this 9mm is ready for you?""Less than three months after the video was broadcast, on October 16, 2022, at shortly after 7 pm, Moreno was closing the cash register of Rafo Parilla, the fast-food restaurant that he ran in addition to his work as a journalist. A man entered the restaurant, his head covered with a cap. The man drew a revolver and shot the journalist three times. Moreno died on the spot. Today, his murderer is still at large.Just a few days before his death, he was in contact with the organization Forbidden Stories to keep his information safe. For six months, 30 investigative journalists took over his work, as he wished. By systematically analyzing all the public contracts of the municipalities that interested the journalist, by interviewing numerous sources and by investigating in the field, the consortium was able to uncover a system of clientelism in the province of Cordoba and has revealed a probable misappropriation of public money that could involve several million euros in five municipalities of the region.",/en/investigations/
The British island of Alderney is divided over how to address its Nazi past,Feature,"At first glance, the island of Alderney is indistinguishable from its neighbors Guernsey and Jersey, with the same sandy beaches and cobbled streets lined with pubs. Like the other Channel Islands, it was occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Yet this island lying 16 kilometers off the French coast has one distinctive feature: It was the only one to house labor and concentration camps, from 1942 to 1944. It is this chapter in the island's history that has recently begun to come to light.After decades of silence, the British government announced on July 27 the launch of a nine-month investigation, with the website Occupied Alderney going online in August to provide reliable, up-to-date information. No archaeological digs or excavations will be carried out.A review committee of 11 experts from Great Britain, France, Germany and Canada will examine archives from all over Europe and from the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. Its goal is to determine not only the number of prisoners who were deported to the island, but above all, the number who died there.The announcement made almost 80 years following the events has not met with the approval of all of Alderney's 2,000 inhabitants. There are two opposing views: One side feels a duty to tell the truth and the other a desire to let go of a past that still makes itself visible on the island. Between pints of beer served to the few customers visiting on this evening of soccer matches, the Campania pub bartender Joe Hamling said: ""Wouldn't it have been fairer if the inhabitants had been consulted and had been able to decide for themselves whether they wanted to confront the history of their island once again?"" Waitress Heather Syer nodded in agreement. ""This investigation affects everyone to different degrees. I've lived here for 16 years, but I think especially of the families who have been here longer and who may not want to stir up the past. I can understand their reluctance.""In June 1940, with the defeat of the French army imminent and Alderney unable to defend itself, Prime Minister Churchill's government urged the inhabitants to evacuate their island. Only a handful of islanders decided to stay. The Germans landed on the island in July. Returning to their land five years later, the inhabitants of Alderney found it disfigured by concrete. The island has continued to bear witness to the occupation ever since, in the form of concrete tunnels, bunkers, cannons and gun emplacements. ""As soon as you set foot outside, you see the traces of war. It's part of our daily lives. You can't escape it,"" said Syer.",/en/m-le-mag/
"A Russian spy in Paris: Bulat Yanborisov, rally organizer and high-flying Kremlin agent",Investigation,"Face to face with Vladimir Alexeyev, the deputy head of Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, a smiling Bulat Yanborisov, 53, received the medal of the Order of Alexander Nevsky, a distinction named after a 13th-century Russian hero known for his military victories. On April 22, 2022, the medal, which recognizes long-standing dedication to the Russian armed forces, joined another on Yanborisov's suit jacket: Order of Valor, a decoration obtained for acts of bravery. ""State awards are not given very often,"" said the senior GRU officer. ""Particularly by decree of the president of the Russian Federation... for the contribution to the defense capabilities of the nation and for the success of several special operations.""In all, four men and one woman received this honor for the ""important mission"" carried out on the orders of Vladimir Putin. True to Russian military tradition, Yanborisov then placed his medal in a glass of vodka before drinking. At the end of this short ceremony, filmed with a cell phone and the video of which was obtained by the German magazine Der Spiegel, the Russian website The Insider, and Le Monde, the general said: ""Awards always find their heroes. Well, maybe not always, but thank God these awards have found you.""This Russian hero happens to live incognito in Paris, near Parc Monceau in the 17th arrondissement, with his wife and two children. He travels back and forth between France and the rest of the world with complete impunity, using an unexpected cover: He is the director of the Silk Way Rally, a car race organized between Russia and China that follows the route of the ancient Silk Road and whose offices are partly located in Paris.The Russian businessman moved to the French capital in 2014, in part to manage the rally, which attracts just under 200 drivers including the largest European teams, such as Peugeot and Volkswagen. In May of the same year, Yanborisov obtained a residence permit from the Paris Prefecture which allows him to move freely. At the beginning of 2022 alone, the spy, who holds a Cypriot passport in addition to his Russian one, traveled to Russia at least 12 times.In Paris, he regularly organizes dinners near his apartment in western Paris with the French executives of the Silk Way Rally organization team. Among them, Luc Alphand, a former ski champion turned car racer, was hired as the Silk Way Rally's sports director before resigning at the beginning of the war in Ukraine. Contacted by phone, he emphasized his ""sporting"" role in this ""beautiful race"" and seemed to have difficulty understanding that his former employer is in fact a spy. ""Oh my God,"" he responded.",/en/investigations/
How mafias are infiltrating European ports,    A Europol report is concerned about the infiltration of European ports by ever more organized criminal groups and the ineffectiveness of the counter-measures adopted by public authorities. ,"Two figures suffice to understand organized crime's interest in the main European ports: In 2021, 98 million containers passed through them and only 2% of them were inspected. This proportion may be as high as 10% when it comes to cargo from South America, the almost exclusive production area for booming cocaine trafficking (more than 162 tonnes were seized in the ports of Antwerp, Belgium and Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, alone between 2010 and 2022). The reality of the European continent's ""sieve borders"" has been bluntly exposed in a scalpel-like report by Europol, which was made public in early April and devoted to ""criminal networks in European ports"": ""The likelihood of containers with illicit goods being detected remains low, especially given the high levels of traffic and daily container throughput.""For organized crime, shipping remains a prime vehicle for the movement of human beings and prohibited goods – drugs, contraband cigarettes, counterfeit items and even protected animals. No company seems to be able to escape their industry, whether through fraud or corruption. To mention only the most recent catch, 2.4 tonnes were unearthed in the port of Antwerp on January 18 on board the Lorena, a container ship belonging to the seagoing giant MSC. Six months earlier, in July 2022, 714 kilos of cocaine were discovered on board the Voltaire, owned by CMA CGM, during an inspection carried out by the Spanish police in Algeciras.With an annual transit of more than one million tonnes, Europe's major ports have an unrivaled competitive advantage over all other arrival points: large cargo volumes, automation of cargo handling and connectivity to land transport – in Rotterdam, the port infrastructure extends 40 kilometers inland – and a ""large number of companies and personnel on the scene,"" according to the report, all of which are targets for bribery.The prerequisite of corruption, astronomical sums of money, offered to dockers, crane operators, employees of port authorities and logistics companies, allows for all variations of modus operandi. Although the most obvious is the ""rip-on/rip-off,"" which consists of physically extracting the cargo from a container unloaded from a ship and loading it into a truck, criminal networks know how to innovate. The report notes that the ""cloning"" method has been ""increasingly observed over recent years"": A container scheduled to pass through a scanning portal or undergo another customs control before leaving the port area is simply ""replaced by a replica container (clone) with the same registration number.""",/en/investigations/
How Russia is staging fake protests in Europe to discredit Ukraine,Investigation,"On February 11, 2023, the Place de la République in Paris was full of people. Thousands of demonstrators had gathered against the pension reform. But, in the middle of the crowd, three men stood out. One of them held a sign, which read: ""EU [European Union], America, stop financing the war in Ukraine.""Less than a month later, on March 5, 2023, the same man stood in Paris' Place Saint-Pierre, in the Montmartre neighborhood in the 18th arrondissement. This time, he performed a Nazi salute in front of banners emblazoned with a Ukrainian flag and which read, ""Erdogan, the earthquake is payback for Russian tourists."" As was the case with their first demonstration, the moment was captured on camera and then published on social media platforms, including Facebook, TikTok and YouTube.Le Monde traced many more similar demonstrations across European capitals. Each time, the message being spread aimed to discredit Ukraine, the EU and Turkey. Le Monde found the same pseudo-demonstrators and the same type of posts across social media. Russian intelligence services are behind the operation.In partnership with the Russian opposition media outlet Dossier Center and the European news organizations DR, Süddeutsche Zeitung, NRK, Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Expressen and SVT, Le Monde obtained and authenticated two documents written by members of the Russian intelligence services.One of them, entitled ""Anti-Erdogan Project"", comments on geopolitical relations between Turkey and Europe. The Russian intelligence services consider that ""Turkey and European Union countries are experiencing significant tensions,"" mentioning the ""tough diplomatic maneuvers"" between Turkey and Sweden and the suspension of the Scandinavian countries' membership process in NATO. The report also states that there is a ""growing anti-Islamic sentiment"" in Europe.To play on this ""feeling,"" the report recommends asking ""local residents or migrants"" to film themselves burning a Turkish flag or tagging slogans ""insulting Erdogan"" in several cities (Paris, The Hague, Brussels, Frankfurt).According to a European intelligence officer specializing in this type of operation, who prefers to remain anonymous, a project of this nature is quite plausible. ""Part of Russia's disinformation campaigns rely on pre-existing tensions, such as those which already exist between Turkey and Germany or between Turkey and France, in this type of hybrid war,"" he explained.Another document reports on the organization and conduct of street action in Paris. Written in Russian, it lists the objectives of the  staged demonstration held at Place Saint-Pierre in Paris on March 5:",/en/investigations/
Uber Files: Former Socialist ministers defend their action against Uber's 'total cynicism',    Two former prime ministers were among those invited to speak to the parliamentary investigative committee looking into how the ride-hailing company established itself in the French market. ,"""We did not give in to the pressure, quite the contrary."" Manuel Valls was the interior minister from 2012 to 2014 and then prime minister from 2014 to 2016, at the time when Uber burst onto the scene in France. Questioned by the parliamentary investigative committee about the Uber Files on Thursday, May 11, the former Socialist defended his government's action in the face of an American company ready to establish itself in the country by any means. Also questioned were his former colleagues in the government Bernard Cazeneuve (interior minister from 2014 to 2016, then prime minister from 2016 to 17) and Alain Vidalies (junior minister for transport from 2014 to 2017).Uber was losing billions of dollars, defying laws, and causing chaos. The Uber Files investigation, published in 2022 by Le Monde and its partners in the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), revealed how far the ride-hailing company was willing to go, based on internal documents passed on to the British daily The Guardian by Mark MacGann, Uber's former chief lobbyist in Europe.In France, Uber counted on the support of Emmanuel Macron, who was the economy minister from 2014 to 2016, and considered at the time by the company to be its best ally in the country. But the former ministers believe that this liberal line did not win out. They believe instead that they brought Uber to heel.A key point in the Uber Files revelations was widely discussed by the three ministers: the nature of the relationship between the Finance and Economy Ministry and the company. Le Monde and its partners revealed that Macron and Uber had negotiated a two-stage battle plan, unbeknownst to the rest of the government. Uber would put an end to its illegal private driver service UberPop, and in exchange, Macron would support a simplification of the conditions for drivers to qualify for the profession. The Uber Files revealed the existence of a text message in which Macron assured Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO, that Cazeneuve had ""accepted the deal,"" even though Cazeneuve was at the time leading the charge against the company.The former interior minister categorically denied to members of the Assemblée Nationale that he had accepted, or even had knowledge of any such negotiations with Uber. ""There is no 'deal' to be had with players who, on the grounds that they were financially powerful, felt that they could place themselves above the law,"" he argued. ""I was never aware of a 'deal' in 2015,"" said Valls. ""I would not have accepted it. We must remember that the attacks on public order with physical assaults were numerous and serious. (...) We could not accept totally unfair and illegal competition.""",/en/investigations/
Tax fraud: France seeks to recoup more than €2.5 billion from banks,    Public Accounts Minister Gabriel Attal provided the figure to senators earlier this month. The adjustments primarily cover arrangements that occurred between 2017 and 2019. ,"At the end of March, France's National Financial Prosecutor (PNF) shook the financial world by unleashing a series of unprecedented searches. Five major financial institutions were in the crosshairs, suspected of being involved in the so-called ""CumCum"" scandal – a large-scale circumvention of dividend taxes revealed in 2018 by Le Monde. Nothing filtered out about the financial stakes involved since.But on May 2, before senators, Public Accounts Minister Gabriel Attal cited a figure highlighting the extent of the phenomenon. The amount of tax adjustments to date decided by authorities totals €2.5 billion. This sum, which includes penalties in addition to the reassessed amounts of tax to be paid, specifically targets the institutions searched by the PNF: France's Société Générale, BNP Paribas, Exane (a financial services company owned by BNPP) and Natixis as well as British banking powerhouse HSBC, along with Crédit Agricole, which has admitted to taking part in these tax evasion schemes but was left out of the searches for the time being.These tax adjustments cover arrangements made between 2017 and 2019, bringing the total amount of fraud to nearly €1 billion per year. By comparison, this represents more than 6% of the total amounts recouped by tax authorities each year.""CumCum"" is therefore likely at least as massive as the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (France's financial watchdog, AMF) – the only public body to have attempted to measure the phenomenon – estimated. In 2021, the AMF calculated the loss of tax revenue (excluding penalties) at €400 million-€1 billion per year. But to date, the AMF and the tax authorities have only focused on the simplest aspect of ""CumCum,"" a technique based on securities lending transactions at the time of dividend payment to avoid taxation.However, many other ""CumCum"" strategies share the same objectives. Some exploit loopholes in favorable tax treaties between France and Gulf countries, providing for a complete tax exemption on dividends for their citizens. Others are based on complex financial instruments, such as total return swaps or futures. Such transactions have not yet been subjected to an official valuation but could bring the total loss of tax revenue to between €2-4 billion per year, according to experts consulted in 2018 by Le Monde and the ""CumEx Files"" consortium of journalists.During a hearing at the Sénat in December 2021, Etienne Barel, a deputy director general with the French Banking Federation (FBF), France's banking lobby, said the amounts were ""very largely overestimated."" Barel criticized ""a major methodological flaw."" However, the extent of the first tax adjustments ordered confirms their relevance, especially as they relate once again solely to the simplest securities lending and borrowing operations. Current audits of more recent transactions could inflate the bill.",/en/investigations/
Revealed: French authorities' failed maneuvers in lead-up to journalist's kidnapping in Mali,    A joint investigation by news organizations including Le Monde reveals that the French military used journalist Olivier Dubois to try to locate a jihadist leader and failed to prevent his abduction. He was held as a hostage for almost two years. ,"French soldiers from the anti-terrorist Operation Barkhane were informed of a journalist's plan to interview a jihadist leader and tried to use him to locate the chief, a joint investigation by French media reveals. Out of security concerns, this information was withheld while French journalist Olivier Dubois was still a hostage of Al-Qaeda. Once Dubois was freed on March 20 after 711 days in captivity, Le Monde, Libération, Radio France Internationale (RFI) and TV5Monde decided to reveal the fruits of their year-and-a-half-long joint investigation into his abduction. At first, the military tried to use the reporter to locate the Al-Qaeda chief. Then, judging the meeting to be too risky, they gave up on their operation at the last minute. But they did not deploy the appropriate means to prevent the kidnapping of Dubois during the meeting in Gao, in the northeast of Mali, in the spring of 2021.On April 8, 2021, Dubois, a freelancer for Libération, Le Point Afrique and Jeune Afrique who moved to Bamako in 2015, traveled to Gao to interview Abdallah Ag Albakaye, a senior figure in the Al-Qaeda-linked organization Nusrat ul-Islam. The 48-year-old reporter believed he had planned this interview with the greatest discretion. But he had in fact been followed for months by the French army, as confirmed by some 180 pages of French and Malian judicial documents that Le Monde has been able to consult.To prepare his investigation, Dubois worked with a fixer, a young Tuareg whom we will call Kader to protect his anonymity. For several years, Kader facilitated contacts between the journalist and various figures in the north of Mali, in particular some from Nusrat al-Islam, with whom he was close. Dubois knew that Kader has already collaborated in the past with Barkhane but believed he could trust him. At the end of 2020, he asked him to pass on his interview proposal to Ag Albakaye.What the reporter did not know was that his fixer would keep the French military informed until the end of the details of the planned meeting with the jihadist leader. On the day of the kidnapping, in an audio recording that Le Monde was able to listen to, a French lieutenant can be heard distinctly asking Kader about ""the name of the street where they asked [him] to drop off Olivier Dubois.""On the day of the kidnapping, the French military had ""all the information"" about Dubois's appointment: photographs of the journalist's clothes, his passport, his plane ticket, his hotel reservation, the car used to get there, GPS coordinates of the place where Ag Albakaye's men were supposed to find him. The above-mentioned lieutenant confirmed all of this to the agents of the General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI, an intelligence agency), who were questioning him as part of the investigation opened by the national anti-terrorist prosecutor's office, on May 5, 2021, into ""kidnapping as part of an organized gang and in relation to a terrorist enterprise"".",/en/investigations/
Video investigation: How the Sudanese military junta repressed protests with live ammunition,   ,"What happened on June 30, when the opposition to the Sudanese military regime called for a historic demonstration? The junta had promised to let the people ""exercise their right to peaceful assembly. But at 8 am, the government cut off the internet.Le Monde collected and authenticated footage made available when the Internet was reactivated. The footage documents the death of eight protesters during the day, most of them from gunfire. Across the country, many other activists were shot and wounded, or arrested and detained by the hundreds.Footage from the same day shows law enforcement officers equipped with AK-47 automatic assault rifles. The units involved included officers from the Central Reserve Police (CRP). Various observers, including nongovernmental organizations, have accused these agents of ""serious human rights violations"". These accusations prompted the United States to place the CRP on its list of organizations subject to financial sanctions, in March. In late June, the CRP took part in the violent crackdown on the mostly peaceful protesters, alongside Khartoum police, riot police, and the army.To turn on English subtitles, click on 'Menu' on the bottom right of the video.",/en/videos/

Refugees held in cage on EU's border as Frontex agents watched,Investigation,"In a small town in southern Bulgaria, in between a nursery school, the local football stadium and rows of quiet houses, a makeshift cage, housed in a shed, is used by Bulgarian border guards to detain would-be migrants. This is shown in footage revealed by Le Monde, in partnership with Lighthouse Reports, Monitor, Der Spiegel, Domani, RFE/RL Bulgaria and Sky News.The makeshift cage is made up of iron bars and littered with garbage and is visible from the street. On five occasions, between October 15 and November 25, Le Monde's partners were able to film the area, where, every time, a dozen or so men had been detained.In one of the videos, some of the men are questioned by the guards about their country of origin: ""Afghans? Morocco?"" Le Monde interviewed four men – Syrians and Afghans – who told us that they had been locked up following their attempt to enter Bulgaria.This cage is not an official holding zone for the detention of people entering illegally. The country is thus free from any control, including regular inspections by NGOs such as the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee or the Ombudsman of the Republic of Bulgaria. However, the cage is located in a police complex loaned by Sredets (south-east Bulgaria) city hall to the border police, which reports to the Interior Ministry.A car from the European agency Frontex, in charge of controlling the Schengen area's external borders, is visible three times in footage filmed by Le Monde and its partners a few meters from the cage.An internal Frontex document, which Le Monde was able to see, emphasizes that their presence is not a one-off: ten of its agents have been permanently deployed in Sredets since the end of March 2022. It is a collaboration between Frontex and the Bulgarian border guards, confirmed in this local press article. It says that a joint patrol of Frontex agents and Bulgarian border guards in Sredets arrested 33 would-be migrants on September 13. They were then detained in the police complex in Sredets.Contacted by Le Monde, Frontex said their agents are limited to border surveillance operations, jointly with the Bulgarian border guards. They did not specify the details of its activities in Sredets.Four Syrian and Afghan nationals interviewed separately by Lighthouse Reports and its partners between October and November in Turkey claimed to have been detained for long hours, sometimes alongside women and teenagers. They also said they were abused.",/en/videos/
How Frontex surveillance equipment is used by the Libyan coast guard to intercept migrants,   ,"To turn on English subtitles, click on 'Menu' on the bottom right of the video.A drone, several aircraft and hundreds of hours of flight time. Since 2018, Frontex has been conducting intense surveillance in the central Mediterranean skies. But the images that the European border and coast guard agency is taking are not only used by member states: the Libyan authorities, who are not supposed to have direct access, also use them. The publication of a dozen surveillance images on Libyan coast guard Facebook pages, between 2018 and 2022, proves it.Le Monde has cross-checked these images with data available in open source and information collected by NGOs active in the Mediterranean (all of the data used in this investigation is freely accessible here). This work allowed us to state that seven of these images were taken by Frontex aircraft.Three images dated May 8, 2019, show a Libyan patrol boat transferring nearly seventy people on board. The migrants were trying to reach Europe on a small boat. But the images also show the invisible: If the Libyan coast guard was able to catch up with this boat, it is thanks to Frontex's assistance. The Libyans, who only have a few patrol boats and no surveillance aircraft, have trouble finding such small boats by themselves.Frontex says that it is not collaborating with the Libyan coast guard. But the Libyan rescue coordination center raises questions: according to NGOs specializing in rescue operations at sea, it is only a facade for the Libyan coast guard.",/en/videos/
China's rural inhabitants are not included in official unemployment statistics,"    China's statistics only include those who hold urban residence permits. The more precarious 'rural migrant workers' are not included, as the authorities consider that they can return to work on the farm if they are out of work. ","Officially, China's urban unemployment rate stood at 5% in September, down 0.2 points compared to August. This is a particularly low rate for an economy in poor health: The real estate sector is in crisis, tech platforms are under close government surveillance and exports fell by 6.2% in September, the fifth consecutive month of decline. At the same time, statistics about young people have not been published since the record high reached in June (21.3%). So what are urban unemployment statistics worth?""Do you know how many rural people are unemployed? Zero: By definition, rural inhabitants are never unemployed, because in theory, every rural family in China owns a small plot of farmland,"" said Scott Rozelle, the co-director of the Stanford Center on China's Economy and Institutions. The authorities consider that rural inhabitants can return to the farm if they are out of work.Their situation is the consequence of the ""hukou"" system, a residence permit that ties a person to his or her place of birth for access to social services, health care, pensions and childhood education. China credits this system, inherited from the Maoist period, for the country's lack of shantytowns.So, in the absence of social rights, ""rural migrant workers"" spend most of their careers in precarious jobs in the city but end up returning to their home provinces. Their children usually remain in the village, cared for by their grandparents. In 2022, they made up 295 million out of China's 780 million workers, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.In times of crisis, they are the first to suffer. In June and July of 2023, Rozelle and his team visited over 100 rural Chinese families. ""We asked how much those in the family who worked earned. On average, it was 60% of what they made in 2019 before the Covid crisis,"" said Rozelle, who is also the author of Invisible China: How the Urban-Rural Divide Threatens China's Rise (University of Chicago Press, 2020). ""We're facing a problem of massive unemployment and underemployment among rural inhabitants, which undermines confidence in the future. The problem affects many more people than urban youth unemployment.""",/en/economy/
Beijing embarrassed by mass youth unemployment,In Depth,"For the past month, Rachel has been looking for work in Shanghai, China. ""I'm expecting to earn 6,000 or 7,000 yuan [€777 or €907], just enough to pay the rent and put food on the table, but I'm hoping to find a company that will allow me to flourish, in advertising or marketing,"" said the young woman. An interesting job: This is what many young people from China's middle class are looking for, even if it means accepting a low salary or learning to be patient. Graduating in the summer of 2022, as one lockdown followed another in China, Rachel (she gave only her English first name), 28, went through a few interviews, before returning to her parents' home to wait for better days. She's almost become a ""full-time child,"" she said with a smile, an expression that has come to designate unemployed graduates who have decided to stay with their parents and be supported, sometimes in exchange for helping out. It's a symptom, among others, of a slowing economy.Youth unemployment has never been higher than in 2023. In June, it reached a record high of 21.3%. With a new cohort of graduates, July's figures were shaping up to be even worse. The authorities have decided to stop releasing details of unemployment by age group. This move has prompted a deluge of online criticism: On the microblogging site Weibo, the subject attracted 140 million views in just a few hours.The reasons for this are well known: The country has not recovered from three years of its drastic zero-Covid policy and has been having a difficult year. Exports are plummeting, real estate is in an unprecedented crisis and domestic consumption has been struggling to recover. As a result, despite a weak basis for comparison, China is barely expected to reach its growth target for 2023, set ""around 5%"" at the beginning of the year.In this crisis context, young people, who lack experience, are generally the first to be affected. Officially, total urban unemployment has remained low, at 5% in September, even if this analysis has been criticized. (It excludes migrant workers, considered as rural.) Young people are all the more affected as they work mainly in the sectors most exposed to the crisis (services, private sector, precarious jobs), and less in the public sector and industry.To make matters worse, between 2021 and 2022, the Chinese authorities launched a regulatory campaign against web platforms such as Alibaba, Tencent and Meituan. Hardest hit, the private tutoring sector was virtually banned in July 2021, resulting in the elimination of hundreds of thousands of teaching jobs. At the same time, a campaign to reduce the indebtedness of property developers has led to the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of jobs, from construction workers to architects, estate agents and mortgage brokers. Already burned by the costly zero-Covid policy, Chinese entrepreneurs have been wondering where the Communist Party's next campaign will strike.",/en/economy/
US auto strike: The workers' vote will be decisive in old industrial America,"Will voters follow Donald Trump in his crusade against the unions and the environment, or Joe Biden, who wants to give industry a boost while ensuring a proper ecological transition?","It's a labor victory for the United Auto Workers (UAW), and a political success for Joe Biden, who made the trip to Detroit, Michigan, on September 26 to support strikers who are the beating heart of this industry. The appearance of the US president on a picket line, unprecedented in the country's history, was proof of his conviction that reindustrialization also requires the revival of the unions.Fighting their cause since mid-September, Ford's unionized employees, followed by those of Stellantis, have pulled off a 25% wage increase over five years, guarantees of plant maintenance and better social security coverage. Of the ""Big Three,"" only General Motors is yet to be convinced, stubbornly refusing to reach an agreement with its army of casual workers, but also the UAW rank and file, who will be consulted over the next few days. This will be a test for Shawn Fain, president of this powerful union who has played a major role in this longstanding conflict, using numerous ploys to destabilize the bosses of the major automakers.""This is a historic agreement that will guarantee workers the pay, benefits, dignity and respect they deserve,"" Biden said in a statement. This is nothing short of a fair return for workers who during the 2008-2009 crisis made heavy sacrifices to save the auto industry, and who now work for companies that are making substantial profits, as former president Barack Obama recalled at the start of the conflict.The day after the president's visit to Detroit, Donald Trump spoke not far from there – to non-unionized workers at a plant spared from the conflict. As one might expect, he offered no support to the strikers, but told them they were on the wrong track and criticized the risks of the green transition for the automotive sector: ""It doesn’t make a damn bit of difference what you get because in two years you're all going to be out of business,"" said Biden's likely Republican opponent.The working-class vote will be decisive in old industrial America, symbolized by the key states of Michigan and Ohio. Will voters follow Trump in his crusade against the unions and the environment, or the outgoing president, who is working on giving industry a boost while ensuring the ecological transition? Polls show that ""Bidenomics"" have failed to convince half of them. Trumpism continues to wreak havoc.",/en/economy/
Greek economy minister welcomes his country's recovery,"    After years of historic economic depression, Greece's economy has shown signs of recovery. Kostis Hatzidakis, who maintains caution, emphasizes the importance of reducing debt while addressing tax evasion. ","In December 2010, Kostis Hatzidakis was mobbed by demonstrators outside the Greek Parliament. A simple rank-and-file New Democracy (center-right party) MP at the time, albeit a former minister and notably responsible for the privatization of Olympic airline, he was attacked and ended up with a bloodied face. A photo showing him visibly in shock went viral.Almost 13 years later, in his corner office with a magnificent view of the same parliament building, the man who is now Greek minister of the economy is savoring the progress that has been made. After a historic depression, the Greek economy has returned to growth over the past three years. The figure should reach 2.5% in 2023 and 2.0% in 2024, well ahead of the rest of the eurozone (at 0.7% and 1.2% respectively). As a symbol of this improvement, the S&P rating agency removed Greece of its junk bond status on Friday, October 13.""For the last decade, our aim was to stay in the euro[zone]. We came very close to disaster. The objective of the current decade, for Greece, is to converge our economy toward the European average."" Today, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is just 68% that of the European Union (EU), making it the second lowest of the 27 EU member states, ahead only of Bulgaria.There is no question, however, of the government increasing its spending. Year after year, it wants to continue posting a ""primary"" budget surplus (before interest payments on debt), which enables it to reduce its public debt. ""We can't perform miracles,"" stressed Hatzidakis, recalling that after the scale of the crisis that shook Greece, whose economy remains 20% below its 2007 level, reconstruction will necessarily be slow.""[Primary surpluses] are not only a precondition to reducing our debt but also a way of proving that we have learned from the past, changed our mindset and are adopting international best practice."" Greece's debt, which reached 206% of GDP in 2020, today stands at 159% and should fall to 152% by the end of 2024, taking advantage of both inflation and the country's significant growth to mechanically reduce this ratio.Public services, bled dry after years of austerity measures, will have to wait, even if Hatzidakis would like to help out hospitals, which have been hit particularly hard. He promises to recruit 15,000 healthcare staff over the next few years. As for the civil service, the rule is now to stabilize the headcount, with one new recruit for every departure, whereas downsizing has long been the norm.",/en/economy/
Europe trails behind the United States in economic growth,"    The eurozone economy contracted by 0.1% in the third quarter, while the US economy grew by 1.2%. Over the past fifteen years, the gap between Europe and America has widened steadily. ","The eurozone economy contracted in the third quarter. On Tuesday, October 31, Eurostat’s first estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) in the twenty countries of the single currency was -0.1%. This is in stark contrast to the United States, which grew by 1.2% over the same period.""It’s almost becoming a universal law,"" François Geerolf, an economist at the Observatoire français des conjonctures économiques (The French Observatory of Economic Conditions), lamented. ""With each crisis, the eurozone permanently loses a few points of growth to the United States."" For the past fifteen years, Europe has been falling further and further behind, shock after shock: the eurozone crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine... Since 2007, per capita growth on the other side of the Atlantic has been 19.2%, compared with 7.6% in the eurozone. A gap of almost twelve points. Before the pandemic, the gap was already ten points, and it has started to widen again in the last eighteen months.Over 2023 as a whole, growth in the Eurozone is expected to reach 0.7%, compared with 2.1% in the United States, according to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Germany, in particular, is suffering, with a slight recession expected at -0.5%, while France should grow by 1%.For Europeans, cities like New York and San Francisco have become extremely expensive, while American visitors to Europe are astonished by the low prices. ""The average income of Americans is more than 20% higher than that of people living in the eurozone,"" pointed out Philippe Crevel, economist at Lorello Ecodata, a consulting firm. ""The standard of living of executives is much higher than that of their European counterparts. American tourists are particularly sought-after because of their abundant purchasing power. The average retirement, taking into account retirement savings, is much higher in the USA than in many European countries.""The main explanation for this growth differential can be summed up in two words, according to Geerolf: ""Fiscal policy."" During the pandemic, the US government supported households in a historic way by issuing multiple stimulus checks. Households were able to put some of this money aside and remain sitting on exceptional savings, which they haven't quite finished spending. As a result, more than half of current growth comes from consumption. On the European side, support was also generous during the pandemic, but not at the same level: the US budget deficit in 2020 and 2021 was 14% and 11.6% of GDP, double that of the eurozone, at 7.1% and 5.3%, respectively.",/en/economy/
Liaoning: China's emerging industrial hub,    The northeastern industrial province has undergone a spectacular technological transformation and established a model in which the public authorities and the private sector are steering the development of world-class companies. ,"For a long time in China, the country's northeastern region did not enjoy a good reputation. Too polluted, too dominated by giant state-owned companies, too corrupt and too similar to neighboring Russia. The north was yesterday's China.In 1992, it was in the far south of the country that Deng Xiaoping kicked off his reforms and opened up the country. The region that embodied China's success was Shenzhen, not Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning and the country's main northeastern province alongside Heilongjiang and Jilin.With one problem leading to another, Liaoning long suffered from a second handicap: The province's strongman in the 1990s was Bo Xilai, an ambitious Maoist who became Xi Jinping's main political rival 10 years later. Bo has been in prison since 2012, and the country's ruler is said not to hold Liaoning close to his heart.Yet these days now seem long gone. Liaoning now feels confident and proud enough of its transformation to invite – with Beijing's approval, of course – a few foreign journalists to witness its transformation.Shenyang, like the German Ruhr, is doing far better than its reputation might suggest. In the 20th century, the city was famous for its sea of smokestacks. But by the end of the 1990s, some 300 steelworks closed in a redundancy plan probably unrivaled anywhere in the world. Nowadays, Shenyang is a green city.BMW has built its main Chinese plant there. The company is the city's biggest taxpayer and employs 23,000 workers, not counting its 430 subcontractors, including the French company Michelin, which employs around 3,000 people.While Liaoning's overall population (42 million inhabitants) is declining due to young people's attraction to the higher wages of the south, Shenyang's is increasing. By the end of the decade, Shenyang's population should exceed 10 million. Its rival, Dalian (population 7 million), the major port in the province's south, is enjoying the same attractiveness.As much as leaders in the country's south like to showcase private companies, those in Liaoning do not shy away from highlighting their role and economic pro-activeness. Like Xi, they are convinced that state-owned groups must continue spearheading the economy. The companies they spotlight are almost all closely linked to the political authorities.Founded in 1921 (when the region was occupied by Japan), North Heavy Industry is the archetypal metallurgical conglomerate, manufacturing everything from steel for the automotive industry to giant tunnel-boring machines for public works groups. Bingshan, a company specializing in refrigeration and industrial heating systems, is owned by both Japan's Panasonic and the city of Dalian. Rongke Power, which employs 600 people and intends to quickly double its workforce, is one of the world leaders in vanadium batteries (a technology that greatly enhances battery performance). Rongke Power also has the Academy of Sciences as a shareholder and uses Dalian as a demonstration zone.",/en/economy/
"Belgium, a 'social paradise' under threat","    The federal government remains generous, with a model based on redistribution, advantageous unemployment and wages and pensions indexed to inflation. But the public debt and deficit are worsening, undermining the system's sustainability. ","A surprising conversation was overheard in a bar in the Châtelain neighborhood, the haunt of many French people in Brussels. ""These Belgians are incredible, with their unemployment benefits not limited in time and their wages indexed: How do they do it?"" Is Belgium a social paradise? It's not always a paradise for labor organizing, in any case: The country was the European champion for strikes between 2011 and 2020, with 97 days per year per 1,000 workers – compared with 93 in France, 18 in Germany and one in Switzerland – according to a study published in January by the Hans-Böckler Foundation.Nonetheless, the image is maintained by anecdotes: ""I know a guy who has just celebrated 20 years of unemployment in Charleroi,"" said a local resident. And by decisions made by companies: The ING bank will soon be offering a few hundred older employees the chance to stay at home and do nothing, while keeping their salaries, thus avoiding the need to undertake downsizing measures. And by statements from politicians: Prime Minister Alexander De Croo explained, on the occasion of the parliamentary debates on the 2024 budget (an agreement was reached on October 9), that the automatic indexing of salaries to inflation has made it possible to maintain the prosperity of citizens, who already have a median salary (€3,507 gross, according to the official Statbel organization) among the highest in the world and have seen their incomes increase by 20% in four years.These salaries could still rise by almost 8% in 2023. ""It's better than our German and French neighbors; the country is doing well,"" De Croo. The quality of the healthcare system and the offer of early retirement are other features that often wow foreign residents.On the other hand, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) study published in April on labor taxation in 2022 was less rosy. Belgian salaries are taxed at 53% for a single person (47% in France, 47.8% in Germany) and at 45.5% for an employed couple with children (40.7% in France, 29.4% for the OECD average).There's another nuance to the story. The federal government remains generous, but this is costing it dearly. The issue of a one-year state bond in September was a huge success (630,000 subscribers, for €22 billion in the space of a few days), but for the first time, it pushed public debt over the €500 billion mark. That's almost 100% of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2022. Furthermore, the government has just cut some €750 million from the healthcare budget, a sector already in crisis, in an attempt to limit the slippage in the public deficit (3.9% of GDP forecast by the European Commission for 2023).",/en/economy/

""To secure its resources, the European Union [EU] is increasingly turning to countries such as Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan,"" summarized Thomas Gomart, director of the French Institute of International Relations.On Saturday, October 28, the death of at least 45 miners at an ArcelorMittal site was a tragic reminder of the vast underground wealth of this remote Central Asian country. On November 1 and 2, French President Emmanuel Macron will visit Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The motive is ""to support both countries in their reform efforts,"" stressed the president's office, as well as strengthening ties ""in the economic sphere, particularly in terms of energy and supplies.""Alongside some 15 business leaders, including from EDF, Suez and Orano (formerly Areva), as well as the Geological and Mining Research Bureau, Macron promised ""announcements of contracts."" In particular, Paris is in line to participate in the construction of Kazakhstan's first nuclear power plant. Access to critical metals will also be on the agenda.Since gaining its independence in 1991, the former Soviet Union country has boasted of having ""all the ores and elements on Mendeleev's table"" in its subsoil. According to the United States Geological Survey, it is the world's leading producer of uranium (with 40% of global production), the second largest producer of chromite (13%) and the fifth largest producer of cadmium (5.9%). It is also reported to have abundant rhenium, zinc and manganese mines.However, it is difficult to assess the full extent of its reserves. ""The economy is somewhat opaque,"" summarized Agathe Demarais of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), an independent think-tank. This is because a large part of the infrastructure and mining assets date back to the Soviet era and because the major Kazakh clans close to the government share part of the resources. Western executives working in the sector are quick to confirm, on condition of anonymity, that corruption is not uncommon.Despite this, the country is one of the most attractive in the region for foreigners, not least thanks to its reform efforts. ""Since its independence, it has been able to exploit its hydrocarbon fields using international companies with the technical skills required to do so,"" explained Dominique Menu, former Central Asia head for BNP Paribas, who writes regularly about the region.",/en/economy/
"Macron visits Central Asia to 'strengthen, complement and accelerate' partnerships","    Macron signed a series of contracts with Kazakhstan, which already supplies 40% of France's uranium, and is the first French president to go to Uzbekistan since 1994. ","French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Uzbekistan Wednesday evening after a trip to Kazakhstan, part of a two-day tour to boost France's footprint in Central Asia. The French leader's visit comes as European nations jostle for influence in the resource-rich region, where Russia, China, Turkey and Europe all have economic interests. Visiting Kazakhstan's capital Astana earlier, Macron said he wanted to ""strengthen [...] complement and accelerate"" France's partnership with the country.Central Asia, which has long been under Russian influence and was part of the Soviet Union, is receiving increasing attention from other powers as Moscow is taken up with its war in Ukraine. Macron acknowledged the ""geopolitical pressures"" being put on Kazakhstan, which borders Russia to its north and China to its east.""I do not underestimate the geopolitical difficulties, the pressures, sometimes the jostling to which you may be subjected,"" Macron told Kazakhstan's president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. ""In a world where great powers want to become hegemonies and where regional powers are becoming unpredictable,"" the French president said he welcomed Kazakhstan's ""refusal ... to take the route of becoming a vassal.""Tokayev, in turn, said France was his country's ""key and reliable partner in the EU"" and that he wanted to give their partnership ""extra impetus."" ""Kazakhstan is the world's top uranium producer, contributing over a quarter of nuclear fuel consumed in Europe,"" he said. ""With nuclear power comprising 63 percent of France's energy sector, there is vast potential for further cooperation,"" he added.The leaders signed a series of contracts in sectors ranging from minerals and energy to pharmaceuticals and aerospace.French energy giant EDF is in the running to build Kazakhstan's first nuclear power station – a project due to be decided on in a referendum this year. The Elysee also announced Paris would supply Ground Master 400 air defense radar systems to Kazakhstan to boost the country's ""sovereignty.""France is the fifth-biggest foreign investor in Kazakhstan, ahead of China, mainly because of the involvement of energy giant TotalEnergies in the massive Kashagan offshore oil field project. The head of French uranium company Orano, which already has a mine in Kazakhstan, is in Macron's delegation. Trade turnover between France and Kazakhstan reached €5.3 billion ($5.6 billion) in 2022 and Kazakhstan supplies around 40 percent of France's uranium needs.China is particularly active in Central Asia with its ""Belt and Road"" project, but Europe and Turkey have also shown growing interest. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are due to visit Astana this week after Macron.Both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are aiming for greater economic openness and balanced diplomacy, even though Russia remains their primary partner. Kazakhstan is part of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) – a Moscow-led military alliance – along with two other central Asian states, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The Kremlin said Wednesday that it maintained a ""historic"" partnership with its ally Astana.""Kazakhstan is a sovereign nation that develops relations with other countries at its own discretion,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday when asked if Russia was concerned by Macron's visit.The trip to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan aims to support ""interest in a diversification of partnerships expressed by both countries,"" a French presidency source said. Several French presidents have visited Kazakhstan since the fall of the Soviet Union, but Macron will be the first to go to Uzbekistan since 1994.Despite their declared wish for political liberalization, both countries are authoritarian states where protests are often violently repressed. Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has put an end to two decades of isolation imposed by his predecessor and former mentor Islam Karimov, but there is still no real political opposition.Macron prefers to emphasize the ""reform dynamic"" going on in the country and has said that the rule of law issue will be brought up during his visit.",/en/economy/
The British Museum launches a hunt for stolen treasures,"    This summer, the museum revealed that it had been robbed of some 2000 pieces stored in its reserves, and is appealing to the public for help in its search. ","A solid gold Roman bangle, a chain with lion-head clasps from Cyprus and finely engraved blue, green and carmine cameos were featured in photographs of items resembling those stolen from the British Museum. On September 26, the museum published on its website details the most important, and also the most embarrassing investigation in its history. The affair came to the notice of the public on August 16, 2023, when the institution revealed that around 2,000 pieces – mainly gold jewelry, semi-precious stones and glassware dating from 1500 BC to the 19th century – had disappeared from its storerooms.It was not the result of a spectacular heist organized by seasoned cat burglars, but in all likelihood, a progressive looting of items over several years, or even decades, which found their way into the pockets of a museum employee; namely one Peter Higgs, the former head of the Greek antiquities department, who had worked at the British Museum for over 30 years, before being dismissed in January 2023 when his employer began to suspect him of theft and degradation.As it was an ongoing police investigation, the museum had declined, until now, to comment further, even when The Telegraph revealed in mid-August that jewelry estimated at over €57,000 had been offered for sale on eBay for derisory sums – sometimes, less than €50. A fact confirmed by the art consultant Ivan Macquisten, who had close contact with collectors who alerted the British Museum as early as 2016, and who in his opinion, were not taken seriously enough.The British Museum has now requested potential buyers to report suspicious items and to contact them via an address dedicated to the return of lost antiquities: ""If you are concerned that you may be or may have been in possession of objects belonging to the British Museum, or if you have any other information that could help us, please email us.""In addition to its appeal to the public, the institution said  in a press release that it is working with several high-profile experts, as well as with the Art Loss Register, the largest computer database in the art world, in which more than ""400,000 items a year are checked by the register."" ""If the stolen pieces appear in it, they will be identified,"" the museum said. But the problem is that ""most of the stolen items (…) have never been photographed, or catalogued,"" said Macquisten and conceded that it would be an impossible task: The British Museum owns 8 million statues, paintings and other relics, including major works that relegate even the most elaborately worked Greek jewelry to the status of trinkets.",/en/m-le-mag/
Media frenzy around disappearance of French boy puts mountain village under the microscope,Investigation,"Sitting in his garden, looking out to the rocky Trois- Evêchés mountain range in southern France, François Balique said: ""It's a mystery. A mystery that's going in every direction."" Oblivious to the jangle of bells from the nearby church, the mayor of Le Vernet continued wearily: ""Why are people so interested? Because it's as mysterious as a miracle. But a tragic miracle.""On July 8, a two-year-old boy named Émile disappeared from the outskirts of this village of 130 inhabitants. The child had been playing near his grandparents' house in Haut-Vernet, a hamlet nestled 2 kilometres from the main village. The summer holidays had just begun.A two-day search by nearly 800 people – gendarmes, voluntary firefighters, family members and tourists – yielded nothing. A 5-kilometre perimeter was scoured in vain. There was not a trace of the boy to be found. The investigation has begun to lose traction. A national unit of 23 specialist police officers, coordinated from Marseille, has been working night and day on the case. But with no clues as to whether Émile is alive or dead, the case has become a litany of unanswered questions: was the child the victim of a road accident? Kidnapping? Family conflict? A wolf attack? In investigations like these, time is the enemy of truth and the accomplice of speculation.At the beginning of September, Balique witnessed the reappearance of journalists wandering the village looking for any locals who may not have given their views on the disappearance yet, and who had not already said that they knew nothing, that they shared the family's sadness and, of course, that they hoped for a happy outcome.A stranger is easy to spot among the chalets and grazing donkeys. Especially as the last tourists have now left the narrow streets of Le Vernet – a village of just 50 permanent homes and 300 vacation properties. Only a handful of hikers remain, to follow a trail which leads to Piedmont in Italy, along tracks once used by shepherds with their herds to evade the summer heat in this ancient alpine region.The mystery surrounding the child's disappearance has fuelled a media frenzy. News site BFM DICI, the local offshoot of France's BFM-TV news channel, has reported a record 20 million visits, compared with the usual 800,000. The producers of Touche pas à mon poste (""Hands Off My TV"") a popular talk show on French television, have combed Le Vernet in search of people keen to air their opinions.The photo of Émile with his blond hair and mischievous smile, a dandelion tucked behind his ear, has been broadcast around the world. A British newspaper drew a parallel between the case and a BBC drama, The Missing (2014), the fictional tale of the disappearance of a little boy in the French countryside. Facebook discussion groups are multiplying, full of people praying and playing amateur detective, as well as criticising the police investigators.",/en/m-le-mag/
The first time Le Monde wrote 'Hamas',"The offensive launched by Hamas on Israel on October 7 stems from a 35-year journey towards extremism. When 'Le Monde' first mentioned the Palestinian organization inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood on June 21, 1988, it wasn't an armed group yet.","""The worst day in Israel's history."" That's how an army spokesman described Saturday, October 7, after the attack launched by Hamas. The death toll continues to rise: Over 1,200 dead on the Israeli as of October 13. The offensive was accompanied by hostage-taking and the murder of civilians, the very definition of terrorism. Fear's triumph is definitive. In its early days, Hamas had not yet specialized in this type of action.The first time the Islamic Resistance Movement (Harakat Al-Muqawama Al-Islamiya) appeared in Le Monde, on June 21, 1988, was as the initiator of a general trade strike paralyzing the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip. On that day, the daily newspaper carried a dispatch from Agence France-Presse (AFP), which referred to this ""Palestinian organization inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood movement"" without mentioning the circumstances of its birth in December 1987, in the wake of the first Intifada.A few weeks later, Jerusalem correspondent Alain Frachon looked at the deployment of this ""fundamentalist group."" It became a competitor for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and its leader, Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestinian national movement.""Traditionally, the Islamist current is strong in Gaza (sometimes even among the militants of Yasser Arafat's Fat[a]h) whereas in the West Bank, it's rather the classical (secular) tendency of the PLO that dominates (itself divided between 'hardliners' and 'moderates'),"" said the journalist, on August 25, 1988. Frachon continued: ""Now, for the first time since the beginning"" of the Intifada, the Islamist movement acted autonomously by launching – alone – a call for a general strike in the West Bank.  It was a ""challenge"" to Arafat's authority.The Islamist organization disseminated its nascent doctrine. ""There is only one solution, the 'jihad' (holy war) for a single objective, a 'Muslim state over all Palestine,'"" its leaders wrote, quoted by the reporter on September 12, 1988. Clearly, without the state of Israel on the map. Hamas called for ""killing the Jews"" at a time when the PLO was preparing to recognize Israel. This division in the Palestinian camp was encouraged by Israeli services, discreet supporters of this new player, said Arafat's supporters.The fratricidal confrontation erupted in the summer of 1992, despite the PLO's outstretched hands. ""Between the secular militants of Yasser Arafat's Fat[a]h and the Islamist 'bearded men' of Hamas, the knives were drawn,"" said Jerusalem correspondent Patrice Claude on July 10, 1992. ""For the first time, pistols, knives, machetes, clubs and slingshots were used in clashes between Palestinians.""",/en/m-le-mag/
The golf rivalry across the Atlantic has never been hotter. Does anyone care?,"At the prestigious Ryder Cup 2023 in Rome on October 1, Europe's top golfers beat their American counterparts. The losers must have forced a bitter laugh.","Let's start at the beginning. Every two years since 1979, a team of America's finest golfers take on their European counterparts. Held alternately in the USA and Europe, the Ryder Cup is one of the major events on the world golfing calendar, and certainly one of the most colorful. In contrast to the generally muted atmosphere of the circuit, the Ryder Cup often gives rise to outbursts, arguments and similar emotional responses, all of which are both quite cheerful and perfectly innocent, but a little embarrassing all the same, don't you think?What can be seen here? Norwegian golfer Viktor Hovland, 26, lying on the green at Rome's Marco Simone Golf Club, cup in hand, surrounded by the wives of European team members. There are 12 of them, most of them on their knees, smiling so broadly that it looks like the teeth whitening industry is doing well among golf champions' wives. But let's just note that their jackets are the characteristic yellow of oilskins worn by sailors to ensure maximum visibility. Here, the goal may well be the same.Many of the players' wives are wearing what look like Panama hats (although the headgear on the left of the picture is open to question). Let me remind you of a truth that is not at all self-evident, and is in fact completely counterintuitive. No, Panama hats don't come from Panama, but from a neighboring country, Ecuador. What's more, they're not just advertising materials designed to please the VIPs at Roland-Garros, but perfectly respectable hats, especially if you buy them from Montecristi or Cuenca.Let's continue our review of the troops by focusing on the perfectly round, petroleum-colored glasses worn by the young woman in the background. These are teashades. That's what opticians called these round glasses, popularized in the 1960s by numerous celebrities, including a host of rock stars eager to effectively hide their glassy, intoxicated eyes, among them Mick Jagger, Roger Daltrey, Ozzy Osbourne and, of course, John Lennon. But I expect that the choice here is purely aesthetic.Finally, let's turn our attention to the hero of the day, a living god or king in the midst of his court, or perhaps both. The triumphant Hovland was enjoying his moment of glory. He could even follow the slow passage of time in the best possible way: On his wrist, and behind the dazzling white ceramic, was a Royal Oak by Audemars Piguet, a horological monument inspired by the shape of a diving helmet screwed onto a wetsuit. It was designed in 1973, and in a single night, by Gérald Genta. Product placement? This photograph is all about product placement.",/en/m-le-mag/
Norway rattled by a series of political scandals,    Four ministers have resigned since the Labour government took office in October 2021. ,"Ever since she had to hand over the reins of the Norwegian government to the Labor politician Jonas Gahr Støre in October 2021 after holding them for eight years, nothing seemed to stand in the way of the conservative politician Erna Solberg from becoming prime minister again at the end of the next legislative elections in 2025. The last local elections that were held on September 11 were a good omen: For the first time since 1924, the Høyre party, which she has led since 2004, came out ahead of Garh Støre's party.A few days later, her victory was overshadowed by a wave of scandals that are still rattling the Norwegian political class. On July 30, the business newspaper E24 asked Solberg, 62, to make public the stock market transactions her husband, Sindre Finnes, carried out between 2013 and 2021 while she was prime minister.On September 15, Finnes, an executive with the Federation of Norwegian Industries, finally complied. To everyone's surprise, he announced that he had carried out over 3,000 transactions for an estimated gain of 1,8 million kroner (€157,000). Some of these transactions involved state-owned companies, casting doubt on the information available to him at the time.At a press conference, Solberg, on the verge of tears, said there had been a ""breakdown of trust"" in her marriage. She claimed her husband lied to her and confessed that she may have unknowingly been guilty of conflicts of interest. Nevertheless, she refused to resign and promised to hire a ""babysitter"" to supervise her husband's financial transactions if she became prime minister again in 2025.For Norwegians, these revelations came as a shock. Trust in politicians has been traditionally high in the Scandinavian kingdom. But ""there's a very thin line between trust and naivety,"" remarked Kim Arne Hammerstad, the author of the book Politiske Skandaler (""Political Scandals,"" 2020). The journalist sees in this series of revelations the fruit of serious investigations carried out by the Norwegian media, which in recent years have chosen the path of investigative journalism.This string of revelations began in mid-summer and first impacted the ruling majority. On July 21, E24 journalists established that in January, Minister of Research and Higher Education Ola Borten Moe, number two in the Center Party, had bought 400,000 kronor's worth of shares in the state-owned company Kongsberg Gruppen, which holds a 25% share in the munitions producer Nammo, a week before the government approved a multi-billion-kronor contract with Nammo. The minister tendered his resignation. He was not the first to do so.",/en/m-le-mag/
"Mahmoud Abbas in Le Monde, from a man in the shadows to the disputed president of the Palestinian Authority","The leader, who is also known as Abu Mazen, was pivotal to the Oslo Accords aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He has always opposed Hamas but never succeeded in weakening it.","Mahmoud Abbas, 87, has been practically silent since the Hamas attack against Israel on October 7 and the start of bombing in the Gaza Strip. He finally spoke up on Sunday, October 15 during a phone call with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. ""Hamas' policies and actions do not represent the Palestinian people,"" stated the disputed leader of the Palestinian Authority. Without any legitimacy or power, the oldest leader in the Arab world is a good example of 50 years of missed opportunities and dashed hopes.It was under his assumed name, Abu Mazen, that the current leader of the Palestinian Authority first appeared in Le Monde, on January 29, 1977. The French-Israeli journalist Amnon Kapeliouk mentioned the declaration by the moderate member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Committee that authorized contacts with the Israeli state and any organization that recognized ""the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people."" During the last two decades of the 20th century, Abbas was first and foremost a man in the shadows.In 1993, at the time of the Oslo Accords, which aimed to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the first portrait written by AFP ­briefly showed his ""discrete"" personality. He was described as a faithful follower of the historic leader, Yasser Arafat. He is not ""particularly popular"" in his own camp, where activists ""don't know him."" Despite his central role in the signing of the historic agreements, he has not received the Nobel Peace Prize, unlike the other three co-signatories, Arafat and the two Israeli statesmen, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, wrote Patrice Claude, Le Monde's correspondent in Israel. For Claude, Abbas, who defends the idea of two states with Jerusalem as the capital, is above all ""the man of secret contacts,"" he wrote on July 1, 1997.Appointed prime minister of the Palestinian Authority in 2003, Mazen became a public figure late in life, at almost 70, after the failure of the latest peace agreements and new deadly confrontations. ""Mahmoud Abbas is not meant to be a figurehead. The question is how much freedom of action he will be allowed by a weakened Yasser Arafat, who may fear the shadow of a strong prime minister,"" wrote Le Monde in its March 13 editorial.The minister soon proved to be a ""mediocre manipulator,"" according to Gilles Paris, in April 2003. The Jerusalem correspondent emphasized Abbas' political ""fragility"" after a suicide attack in Tel Aviv a few hours after his inauguration.",/en/m-le-mag/
"In New York, is this the end of Trump Tower?","    Located in the heart of Manhattan, the 58-story building embodies the success and power of the former president of the United States. Prosecuted for financial fraud, the billionaire could lose his jewel. ","Rarely has a building symbolized a man's success to such an extent. But Trump Tower, on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, could slip away from the man whose name it bears. In a civil trial that began on October 2 and is expected to last until Christmas, Donald Trump, well positioned to become the Republican presidential candidate in 2024, is accused by the state of New York of having considerably inflated the value of his assets in order to obtain more advantageous loans from banks – a charge he denies. The former US president (2017-2021) could be forced to part with his precious glass tower, which houses his company's headquarters and the penthouse in which he has lived for over 30 years. This triplex with its overly elaborate, flashy decor is one of the key elements of the Democratic prosecutor's complaint, which denounces a massive, and fraudulent, increase in the value of the apartment.The story goes that Trump had been eyeing this location for a while, a stone's throw from Central Park and right next to the jeweler Tiffany & Co., where the luxury department store Bonwit Teller was located. In 1979, the real estate magnate bought the building, renowned for its Art Deco facade. Despite his promise to donate sculptural elements to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he was able to erase traces of the past. The billionaire was also accused of underpaying undocumented Polish workers and making them work in unsafe conditions – he would pay over $1 million to put an end to the lawsuit in 1998. Designed by the American Der Scutt, the skyscraper has 58 floors – although the top one is numbered 68. At the entrance, the giant letters ""Trump Tower"" overhang two revolving doors opening onto an immense atrium open to the public and clad in pinkish marble.When it opened in 1983, the jewel of the Trump empire became a fashionable place to be. Prices soared and stars flooded in – Steven Spielberg had an office and Michael Jackson had an apartment. Over time, the building became part of New York's heritage. In 1997, the skyscraper stood proudly at the center of the cover of the video game Grand Theft Auto, with a police car at its feet. While the glass tower also made a few appearances in film, it enjoyed its greatest success on the small screen, serving as the set for The Apprentice, the reality show Trump hosted from 2004 to 2015. At the end of each episode, a fictitious meeting room in the building was the setting for the now-famous line ""You're fired!"" shouted by the host to one of the contestants.In 2015, the billionaire chose Trump Tower as his campaign HQ and celebrated his victory in his triplex, which occupies the building's top floors. The 45th US president subsequently moved into the White House but returned regularly before making Mar-a-Lago, in Florida, his primary residence. During his presidency, the foot of the tower became a rallying point for his opponents. Since his defeat in 2020, the place has lost some of its splendor. It's still possible to eat a burger at the Trump Grill, sip a latte at the Trump Cafe or do some (expensive) shopping at the Trump Store, but it's no longer as crowded as it once was. While Gucci recently extended the lease on its street-side boutique, others have preferred to distance themselves from it. Even Starbucks has moved away. All that remains is for the 10 golden letters with pride of place over the entrance to be taken down.",/en/m-le-mag/
One Israeli family shares how their ideal kibbutz life turned to terror,Long Read,"""Yarin has disappeared. If you have any information, please contact us. She was at the Nahal Oz base yesterday."" It was the day after the October 7 attack when hundreds of Hamas militants infiltrated Israel, launching assaults on soldiers and civilians, resulting in the loss of at least 1,400 lives. On social media platforms, the sweet face of 20-year-old Yarin, a nurse at the Nahal Oz military base on the border with Gaza, was shared by Patrick Spitz, her grandfather.A few hours later, it was Yaël, one of Patrick's three daughters, who, in a voice message sent to me, announced the death of her niece. She was breathless: ""She's dead. Her body is being guarded by the army. She was not kidnapped. We're all devastated."" No burial date has yet been set, as the entire region has been declared a combat zone.Malka Rafenberg, Patrick Spitz's wife and Yarin's grandmother, is a distant relative of mine whose life I've been keeping track of for a number of years, thanks in particular to social media. We talk regularly without ever having met. In 1939, Malka's father Shimon, a cousin of my great-grandfather, left Warsaw, enlisted in the Polish cavalry and managed to escape on horseback to the USSR as soon as the Germans invaded. With its pogroms, indignities and anti-Semitism, Poland was a hostile land for Jews. Family members who fled to France, the United Kingdom or Russia survived. Others perished in the Warsaw ghetto or concentration camps.In Leningrad, Shimon met Helena, a medical student. Together, they moved to Tashkent (now Uzbekistan), where their son Yoel was born, and then to Lviv, Ukraine, where their daughter Malka was born in 1951. Nine years later, they returned to Warsaw, where their parents had disappeared and the family home had been razed to the ground. They learned that Poland was the only Soviet bloc country to allow Jews to emigrate to Israel. They moved to the suburbs of Tel Aviv. Shimon worked in the aeronautics industry, while Helena, who became an oncologist, devoted herself to raising their children.In 1970, Patrick Spitz, a 23-year-old from a Catholic family in Strasbourg, visited a friend in Israel. Having left home at the age of 18 with his brother, he loved discovering the world and had just returned from a long trip to San Francisco, California. In the seaside resort of Eilat, he met Malka, fell in love, converted to Judaism and decided to stay in Israel.Forty-eight hours before the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, they married and settled in the Magen kibbutz, just 5 kilometers from the Gaza Strip (then under Israeli control). The kibbutz was founded by Romanian Holocaust survivors in the aftermath of the Second World War. For Patrick Spitz, the choice of kibbutz life echoed his French upbringing. ""In Strasbourg, we grew up in a large family, and our mother ran a kind of boarding house where workers lived alongside doctors, and everyone paid rent according to their income. It was a sort of French-style kibbutz,"" said his brother, Thierry Spitz.",/en/m-le-mag/
"In the name of the Father, the Son and your pet","Some products and practices, born in the United States, are spreading around the globe. In her column, Le Monde's Guillemette Faure examines the unusual New York practice of blessing animals of all shapes and sizes.","A police horse waited on the sidewalk, a dog from the police dog unit tugged on its leash. Marble Church on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan was holding its special blessing of animals ceremony that Sunday. Klara Hendrick, who usually comes alone, came with Rosa the tortoise. She was sure the animal didn't miss a minute of the sermon, as she saw it stick its neck out and turn its head towards a dog next to her when the pastor called for openness to people who aren't like us.""He had it all figured out."" He? ""May I ask what Rosa's pronouns are?"" asked Stan Williams, marketing manager of this parish of the Protestant Reformed Church, whose lapel is adorned with all manner of brooches of butterflies, birds, frogs... ""He,"" replied Rosa's owner. ""Thank you for asking, that's really thoughtful of you.""""Stupidly, I would have asked if it was a male or a female, I'm so old school,"" blurted out another parishioner, a little embarrassed. ""You have to be sensitive,"" said Williams. In addition to Rosa, more than 100 animals made the trip. There were dogs of all sizes, a canary, a cat, children with soft toy animals, and people who took out their phones and asked Michael Bos or Elise Brown – the pastors of Marble Church – to bless the photos.What could be more natural? The blessing of animals is an extension of the attitude of St. Francis of Assisi, the church explained. Various parishes in New York hold such blessings in October, such as Saint John the Divine Cathedral, where, on the previous Sunday, a camel and ostriches were among the 1000 animals blessed. At Marble Church, the blessing of the animals, despite its air of old Christian tradition, has only been taking place for six years and is one of the initiatives through which the parish is trying to forge links with those who have become estranged from religion.The decline of faith is one of the most striking phenomena in the USA over the last 30 years. Three in 10 American adults say they have no religious affiliation, a number that has never been higher, rising to 43% among those under 30. ""It's important that we do this on the street in front of the church, not inside. Some people are intimidated by going into a church..."" observed Williams. ""My two dogs are in there,"" said a chic blonde lady, pointing to her black leather handbag, which she explained contained their ashes. People with pets are often lonely, the parish found, and blessings are also a way of reaching out to them.In her mistress' arms, Peppermint was wearing a pompom collar for the occasion. This 14-year-old dog has spent her life making the rounds of retirement homes, convalescent homes and hospitals. ""She's retiring after a career in therapy,"" said her proud owner.",/en/m-le-mag/
Sweden: Tesla employees strike to defend their wages and social model,    The movement began on October 27 to protest the American brand's refusal to sign a Swedish collective bargaining agreement. ,"""Shame on you Tesla, shame on you!"" Former Swedish Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan Löfven is not one to let his emotions get the better of him. But the former leader of the powerful IF Metall union saw red when he learned that American giant Tesla was refusing to sign Swedish collective bargaining agreements.In a message posted on Facebook on Sunday, October 29, Löfven announced that he would be boycotting Elon Musk's cabs, and encouraged his fellow citizens to suspend their purchase of a Tesla ""until an agreement is signed.""Since October 27, the union has been on strike at seven Tesla dealerships in Sweden, employing 120 people. If no agreement is reached by November 3, IF Metall is threatening to extend the strike to the brand's service centers in some 15 towns. The Transport union, meanwhile, has announced that it is ready to block all Tesla electric vehicle departures and arrivals at four of Sweden's largest ports from November 7, in solidarity with the company's employees.""This dispute is about wages, pensions and insurance for our members working at Tesla. But fundamentally, it's also about defending the whole Swedish labor market model. In Sweden, unions and employers agree on working conditions, within the framework of collective bargaining,"" IF Metall President Marie Nilsson explained.According to the union, talks with the company broke down on October 24. Refusing to sign the industry agreements, Tesla representatives reportedly stated that the group ""has no collective agreement anywhere in the world"" and that ""this is a decision that has to be made at the highest level of the company,"" according to Veli-Pekka Säikkälä, in charge of collective agreement negotiations at IF Metall.The development is exceptional. The last time the metalworking union compensated its striking members was in 2010. Then, IF Metall was in dispute with a stone-cutting company, which refused to sign collective agreements. On several occasions since then, the union has threatened to stop work, but each time a compromise was reached before a strike was called.Another peculiarity: the American company seems ready for confrontation. Tesla employees have revealed that they have been threatened by their bosses. The Swedish newspaper Dagens Arbetare reported that Tesla was planning to break the strike by transferring employees from one dealership to another within the country, in violation of the Saltjöbad agreement, which has regulated relations between unions and employers since 1938.",/en/economy/
ArcelorMittal asked to leave Kazakhstan following tragedy in Kostenko coal mine,"    A coal mine owned by the multinational company experienced a methane blast that killed 46 miners on October 28, leading Kazakh President Tokayev to call for the company's departure. ","A red star, a distant symbol of Kazakhstan's Soviet past, still stands at the top of the headframe overseeing the descent and ascent of workers at the Kostenko coalmine run by ArcelorMittal. On Saturday, October 28, however, 46 miners did not come back out of the mine alive, victims of a methane explosion and the ensuing fire. This death toll makes it the deadliest accident in Kazakhstan's history. The country is home to significant natural resources (oil, gas, uranium, coal, iron, gold) that are highly sought after by multinational corporations, including ArcelorMittal for iron and coal, TotalEnergies for hydrocarbons and Orano for uranium.The tragedy led the president of Kazakhstan to declare a national day of mourning on Sunday, October 29, and, more importantly, to announce the departure of the group led by Indian businessman Lakshmi Mittal. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev placed the entire responsibility for the accident on ""the worst enterprise in Kazakhstan's history in terms of cooperation with the government."" The Kazakh government has signed a preliminary agreement to nationalize ArcelorMittal Temirtau, the local subsidiary of the global steel giant. The steel and mining group, which had been present in the country since 1995, stated on Monday that it was committed to completing the operation as quickly as possible to minimize production disruptions related to its departure. At the same time, the company's stock price fell by more than 4% on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.The Kazakh public does not tolerate these mining accidents in a country where oil, gas and minerals remain the backbone of the economy. Five deaths occurred at the Shakhtinskaya mine in August 2022, and five more at the Lenin mine three months later. This is the very location where the worst mining disaster in the country occurred in 2006, resulting in 41 deaths, until the recent accident on October 29. A total of approximately 200 people are believed to have lost their lives at Kazakh mining sites since the country gained independence.The government has accused the Luxembourg-based steel company of not implementing complete safety regulations and of operating outdated facilities. But the group claims to have improved the situation in recent years, within the general regulatory framework set by the 1995 Safety and Health in Mines Convention by the International Labor Organization. This convention stipulates that ""employers shall take all necessary measures to eliminate or minimize the risks to safety and health in mines under their control."" This includes air quality and adequate ventilation, structural maintenance, ground stabilization, prevention of explosions and fires, periodic inspections and more.",/en/economy/
Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara had a low-budget screening. Does anyone care?,"On October 14, Joaquin Phoenix and partner Rooney Mara hosted a special screening for their documentary 'The Smell of Money' at a small venue in Santa Monica, with a costume budget worthy of independent cinema.","A red carpet? No. Gala outfits? No. On Saturday, October 14, celebrity couple Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix hosted a screening of the documentary The Smell of Money at the Laemmle Monica Film Center in Santa Monica, California. Produced by Mara's sister Kate, the film reveals the unsavory underbelly of North Carolina's pork industry.For the occasion, the two actors didn't pull out all the stops, appearing in clothes that had clearly not been chosen by a stylist, were not subject to any lucrative product placement, or even taken to the cleaners. At a time when celebrities' outfits are all the rage, and often the subject of haggling between brands and agents, let's note the significance of the gesture: Some stars are not for sale at all times.How could we fail to notice the shoes worn by Phoenix? On his feet were black Converse All-Star low-tops so faded by time and sunlight that they looked gray, reminiscent of one of the most famous pairs of sneakers in history. Kurt Cobain once sported black and gray All-Star low-tops, famously emblazoned with the word ""endorsement"" on the front of the shoes. The Nirvana singer was denouncing this marketing technique of having a celebrity wear a garment to promote it. Well, well.That evening, the two actors were dressed entirely in black, but sported white socks. Was this a serious lapse of taste? It's more complicated than that. While there's a powerful and long-lasting stigma attached to wearing white sports socks in France, there's a real tradition of wearing them elsewhere. The garment has traversed many subcultures (punk, mods, teddys) since one day in the 1950s when Gene Kelly decided to make it his fetish accessory. It was a clever trick to draw the spectator's gaze to his footwork.Mara wore an MA-1 bomber, a nylon jacket introduced by the US Army in the 1950s and regularly worn by pilots ever since. In this case, Mara's was not midnight blue like the original, but black. It was also lined, without a shadow of a doubt, with its iconic orange quilted fabric. Why orange? Because, at the time, it was considered to be the most effective color for locating victims of plane crashes.",/en/m-le-mag/
French Jewish leader hopes to be a balanced voice,"    Yonathan Arfi, president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions, strives to represent all the interests of the French Jewish community. As in recent days, following the Hamas attacks. ","Shortly after 4:30 pm, the sound of footsteps on the stairs heralded the arrival of the children and their babysitter. In a hurry to talk about their day, and anxious to know ""where they're going to eat,"" they discovered that their living room was occupied by a journalist and a photographer. (""In the kitchen,"" suggested their father). Yonathan Arfi, 43, is a busy father of four children, aged from 1 to 7 and a half, and is the president of the Conseil Représentatif des Institutions Juives de France (CRIF, Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions).Since October 7, Arfi has been a fixture on TV and radio: ""Difficult days lie ahead. We need to prepare for them, while avoiding panic or over-reaction,"" he said. ""I don't want Jewish life to back down in the face of threats."" Elected to head the institution in June 2022, he devotes ""over 80% of his time"" to this job, which he is passionate about. This unpaid position has long been occupied by older men with established professional positions. The head of a consulting firm, Arfi has the means for this commitment, ""without being a millionaire.""In his toy-filled apartment, posters trace the history of the Jews in France. The famous ""Dreyfus is a traitor"" and ""Dreyfus is innocent"" occupy an entire wall, in a reference to the Jewish military captain convicted of treason. There are retro advertisements for flights to Israel and a facsimile of the French Jewish emancipation decree of September 27, 1791. ""I'm very keen to see the Jewish experience looked at in a way other than through the victim angle and the issue of anti-Semitism.""He is optimistic and confident in republican values: universalism and secularism. He feels close to the world of Charlie Hebdo. André Glucksmann's work on totalitarianism has left its mark on him, as has his reading of Albert Camus – ""Because, in Camus, there's an acceptance of tension and nuance. I'm very wary of unanimity, and that's important in Judaism.""Born in Toulouse in 1980, he grew up in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, in the Paris region, in a family of four children. His mother, a housewife, is Moroccan-Jewish. His father, a dentist, is Algerian-Jewish. He met his future wife, Arielle Schwab, in the Union des Étudiants Juifs de France (EUJF, Union of French Jewish Students), in 2009.

""I'm building with them and for them a life as French Jewish citizens who feel good about themselves."" But when he drives them to school, the family travels under police protection.

Giorgia Meloni's break-up is Italy's hot new soap opera,    The prime minister announced she and her partner were separating after he was recorded making lewd comments. ,"The announcement stunned Italy. In a message published jointly on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) on the morning of October 20, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made public her break-up from her partner, the TV journalist Andrea Giambruno. ""My relationship with Andrea Giambruno, which lasted almost 10 years, is over (...). We have been going our separate ways for some time, and the time has come to acknowledge this,"" wrote the head of the Italian government. The brief message was accompanied by a smiling photo of the couple and their daughter, Ginevra, aged 7.According to several Italian newspapers, the break-up seemed to have occurred several weeks ago, but this surprising confession – the talk of every Italian household – is just the latest chapter in one of those political and media dramas that Italy is so fond of. Over the past few days, it has become a kind of soap opera, mixing public discourse with the atmosphere of a telenovela.In Italian political life – which sometimes verges on a farcical tone – the nationalist government led by Meloni's far-right Fratelli d'Italia party keeps satirical TV shows in business. According to René Alviero, the pseudonym of the X account ""Il Grande Flagello,"" a specialist in parodying politicians and journalists on social media, ""this right-wing government is a unique source of inspiration, with its over-the-top slogans,"" and the Meloni-Giambruno gossip adds a touch of celebrity drama.It was a macho, vulgar blunder by Giambruno that prompted Meloni to go ahead and post her break-up message. In footage broadcast by Striscia la notizia, a popular satirical program on the Berlusconi family-owned Canale 5 network, Giambruno – who works as a journalist for Rete 4, another private channel in the Berlusconi-owned Mediaset empire – is seen, during a recording, making very direct advances towards the on-set female assistants: ""What's your name? Have we met before? Where have I seen you before? Was I drunk?"" he asked, before continuing: ""Do you know that me and [name redacted] are in a relationship? All Mediaset knows it, and now you do too. Now, we're looking for a threesome.""""This gives an idea of the level of debate, we really are engaged in voyeuristic politics,"" said Aldo Grasso, professor of communications at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan and columnist for the daily Corriere della Sera. In his view, ""off-microphone"" comments have been polluting the Italian political arena for half a century now. But it was the entrance of Silvio Berlusconi into politics that created the context that led this excessive, lewd language to reach new heights. ""We're in the continuation of what Italian politics has been doing since 1994 and the triumphant arrival of Silvio Berlusconi. Television has ceased to be a platform and has become a political weapon,"" said Grasso.",/en/m-le-mag/
"Kim Aris, Aung San Suu Kyi's son: 'I don't want her to be forgotten'","    Kim Aris has spent his life carefully remaining in the shadows. His mother, Aung San Suu Kyi, the 78-year-old Myanmar opposition leader, was jailed again by the junta in 2021. Her son has decided to speak up to raise awareness of the fate of his mother, her image tarnished after her silence over the Rohingya massacre. ","He has remained silent his whole life, letting his tattooed skin speak for him. Just one glance is enough. From his wrist to his collarbone, a long snake called a naga, a mythical creature and fierce guardian of Buddhist temples in Myanmar, slithers up his left arm, whose pointed tail disappears beneath the sleeve of his t-shirt. On his shoulder is a red and gold flag, that of the National League for Democracy (NLD), the party founded by his mother, Aung San Suu Kyi, then a dissident in Myanmar. He got the tattoo impulsively in 2010, 48 hours before reuniting with her in front of the world's cameras in Yangon, after 10 years apart. ""It was my way of showing everyone, without saying anything, that I supported her,"" said Kim Aris, the youngest son of British Tibetologist Michael Aris, who died in 1999, and the former Myanmar leader. He has inherited his mother's gaunt face and inquisitive eyes, as black as two obsidian fragments.This is the first time he agreed to an interview with the French press. Kim has broken his silence to alert international public opinion to his mother's captivity. The head of the Myanmar government, overthrown by a military coup on February 1, 2021, has since been imprisoned in the capital, Naypyidaw. After 10 years of democratic transition, Myanmar is once again ruled by a junta and is experiencing a violent civil war between the coup army and pro-democracy rebels. Accused of corruption, violation of state secrets and electoral fraud, among other charges, Aung San Suu Kyi was sentenced on December 30, 2022, to 33 years in prison, following a ""ludicrous"" trial with ""trumped-up cases,"" according to Amnesty International. Her sentence was reduced to 27 years in August on the occasion of a special Buddhist holiday. At 78, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate could become a centenarian in prison. ""It's a miracle she's still alive. Frankly, they're trying to kill her,"" said Marie-Laure Aris, Aung San Suu Kyi's French sister-in-law and Kim's aunt, who lives in London and was visiting Paris.On one morning in October 2023, Kim, 46, welcomed Le Monde to Chiswick, a leafy, well-off suburb of the British capital. His red-brick semi-detached house has been carefully decorated, like a museum, with bronze statues in every corner. He looked ready to pounce, in sneakers and an Aztec print sweater his long gray hair pulled back by a headband – he has refused to cut it until his mother is released.

Macron to visit Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to bolster France's influence in the region,    The French president heads to Central Asia on Wednesday in hopes of strengthening economic ties and discussing energy projects in a region contested by global powers. ,"French President Emmanuel Macron heads to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on Wednesday, November 1, aiming to boost France's profile in a region where Russia, China, Turkey and Europe are all jostling for influence. Macron lands in the Kazakh capital Astana for talks with counterpart Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, followed by the signing of contracts, including in pharmaceuticals and aerospace. After meeting university students, the French leader will then travel on to Samarkand in neighboring Uzbekistan where he will stay until Thursday.France wants to put its political and economic mark on the energy-rich region. French energy giant EDF is in the running to build Kazakhstan's first nuclear power station – a project that is due to be decided on in a referendum this year. Critical minerals vital for clean energy technologies, which the region has plenty of, will also be part of the talks. The head of French uranium company Orano, which already has a mine in Kazakhstan, will be in Macron's delegation.France is the fifth-biggest foreign investor in Kazakhstan, ahead of China, mainly because of the involvement of energy giant TotalEnergies in the massive Kashagan offshore oil field project. Trade turnover between France and Kazakhstan reached €5.3 billion ($5.6 billion) in 2022 and Kazakhstan supplies around 40% of France's uranium needs.Central Asia, which has long been under Russian influence and was part of the Soviet Union, is receiving increasing attention from other powers as Moscow is taken up with its war in Ukraine. China is particularly active with its ""New Silk Road"" project, but Europe and Turkey have also shown growing interest. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are due to visit Astana on Thursday and Friday, shortly after Macron.Both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are aiming for greater economic openness and balanced diplomacy, even though Russia remains their primary partner. Macron's visit aims to support ""interest in a diversification of partnerships expressed by both countries,"" a French presidency source said. Several French presidents have visited Kazakhstan since the fall of the Soviet Union, but Macron will be the first to go to Uzbekistan since the late French leader Francois Mitterrand visited in 1994.Despite their declared wish for political liberalization, both Central Asian countries are authoritarian states where protests are often violently repressed. In 2022, crackdowns on riots killed 238 people in Kazakhstan and 21 in Uzbekistan. Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has put an end to two decades of isolation imposed by his predecessor and former mentor Islam Karimov, but there is still no real political opposition. Macron prefers to emphasize the ""reform dynamic"" going on in the country and has said that the rule of law issue will be brought up during his visit.",/en/economy/
"Johann Soufi, a voice for Gaza","    The lawyer, who has worked for the United Nations agency in charge of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East, is worried about the fate of Gazans and the thousands internally displaced within the enclave. ","Suddenly, tears welled up in his eyes. ""A child dies every 15 minutes in Gaza. We have been talking for two hours: Eight children have already died."" Since the tragic day of October 7, with more than 1,400 persons murdered by Hamas in Israel, and the outbreak of war, Johann Soufi, 41, has become a voice of Gaza. A lawyer specializing in international law, Soufi said, ""I don't want to become a media personality, the embodiment of the defender of the people of Gaza. But I do want to give them a voice.""In an op-ed published in the French edition of Le Monde on September 21, he wrote: ""In the absence of any prospect of a political solution, only the International Criminal Court (ICC) is today capable of bringing hope of justice to the Palestinian victims."" Now, as the war rages on, he explained, ""Justice can be patient. The emergency is the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, the protection of civilians and the survival conditions of the thousands of people displaced to the south of the territory.""From September 2020 to March 2023, he headed legal affairs for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Middle East (UNRWA). It constituted more than 13,000 employees, with 1.6 million beneficiaries at the time. ""UNWRA manages schools, hospitals, social services, food distribution, labor law, international law,"" explained the man who was never imagined for such a mission.The son of a Breton mother and a Kabyle father (he holds French and Algerian nationalities), both lawyers, Soufi grew up and studied in Cergy, close to Paris. He joined a criminal law firm in Pontoise, also on the outskirts of Paris, but did not thrive there. ""I wanted to tackle bigger issues. Justice is something I see on a much larger scale..""At the age of 25, he wrote to the 300 lawyers working with the ICC. Only one, Arthur Vercken, gave him a chance. He joined his team to take part in the defense of Callixte Kalimanzira, a former senior official in the Rwandan Ministry of the Interior on trial for his involvement in massacres of Tutsis. He flew to Kigali, then to Tanzania, where the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is based. He stayed for four years. ""It was wonderful. That's when I got hooked on international justice and said to myself that I would do it until the day I died.""This was followed by assignments in East Timor, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali and the Central African Republic. In 2012, he was recruited by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, which was trying Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia.

"In Germany, the wealthiest fear losing their parental leave allowance","    A heated debate is unfolding around a specific bill to abolish parental leave allowance for families with annual taxable incomes above €150,000. ","At the outset, it was a singular demonstration. On September 9, in Hamburg's affluent and central Jungfernstieg neighborhood, parents rallied against a proposed bill aiming to restrict parental allowance to families with annual taxable incomes below €150,000."" No to the abolition of parental allowance! Yes to equal rights!"" they chanted, signs in hand, facing Lake Alster and the facades of luxury stores.What is it all about? Elterngeld is a parental allowance introduced in 2007 to boost the birth rate in Germany. It can be paid up to the child's first 12 months, or up to 14 months if shared between both parents. It enables the parent who stops working to receive 65% of his or her net income, with a minimum monthly benefit of €300 and a maximum of €1,800. According to the latest figures from the Federal Statistical Office, almost 1.4 million women and 482,000 men received the benefit in 2022. On average, 42% of parents in Germany benefit from Elterngeld. Women take 12 months, while men (26% of recipients in 2022, compared with 20.9% in 2015) take two or three months. If the law is passed, parents earning more than €150,000 in taxable income per year will not be entitled to anything.Announced in July by the federal family minister, Lisa Paus (Green party), the measure could be applied as early as January 1, 2024, if it is passed in parliament in December. While the austerity plan decided by the Ministry of Finance imposes massive cuts, the Ministry for Family Affairs argues on its website that the wealthiest households could contribute more. Of the €13 billion allocated to it, €8 billion goes to the Elterngeld, with the remainder funding child protection and fighting violence against women, among other things. According to Paus, the measure would provide better support for struggling families.But the problem is, it's not being well received. First of all, it has all happened too fast. The January 1, 2024 deadline means that women who are already pregnant would see all their budget forecasts go out the window. On social media, they are criticizing the bill, which they see as an attempt to punish them for having succeeded professionally and earning a good living.There's the woman who is due to give birth in 2024 and plans to stop working for three months to bring her household income below the €150,000 threshold. There's the woman who knows she'll no longer be entitled to Elterngeld and is reluctant to resign to collect unemployment. There's the one who consults a tax adviser to deduct everything possible to keep her taxable income under the fateful €150,000 mark. And finally, there's the woman who pulls her hair out calculating: ""What if I worked part-time? I'd contribute less to my pension, but I'd still get the Elterngeld. On the other hand, I run the risk of being sidelined when I return from parental leave."" ""In short,"" complained another, ""it seems like this bill is designed to keep mothers at home!""",/en/m-le-mag/
Dunkirk and Gaza: A relationship tested by war,"    Since their twinning in 1996, the northern French city of Dunkirk and the Palestinian enclave created multiple projects, until Hamas came to power in 2006. There were plans to relaunch this partnership, but the attack on Israel dampened this hope. ","""Between Dunkirk and Gaza, it's a long story"": Matteo Pottier Bianchi doesn't know where to start. At the age of 22, this history teacher who studied the French Second Empire at the Sorbonne was elected president of the Dunkirk-Gaza French-Palestinian association in December 2022. His mission: to preserve cooperation between the northern French city and the Palestinian enclave, which have been linked by a twinning arrangement since 1996. ""There are similarities between Dunkirk and Gaza,"" he explained. ""Geographically, both territories extend over a strip of land along the coast. They have also both experienced occupation, war."" Since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, the situation has of course changed completely. ""No communication is possible,"" lamented Pottier Bianchi. ""We can't do anything, no one can get to Gaza. A student exchange between Dunkirk and Palestine was set to be launched, but the war has frozen it.""The link between Dunkirk and Gaza was officially forged by Michel Delebarre (1946-2022), the Socialist mayor of the northern city for 25 years, from 1989 to 2014. The former minister under President François Mitterrand was particularly sensitive to the Israeli-Palestinian question. ""For him, the 1993 Oslo Accords, which were supposed to mark the end of the conflict, were a great moment of hope, quickly dashed following the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,"" noted Claude Nicolet, Delebarre's deputy from 1995 to 2014. ""He wanted to find a way to work for peace.""Inspired by the twinning arrangements established between German and French towns at the end of the Second World War to bring the two populations closer together, Delebarre wanted to do the same with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Initially, the idea of a three-way marriage between Dunkirk, Gaza and the Israeli municipality of Ramat Hasharon, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, was considered. In 1997, a tree of peace was even planted in Dunkirk in the company of Delebarre, Ashraf Shaat, a Gazan student at the University of Dunkirk, and the mayor of Ramat Hasharon, Ephraim Hiram. ""Despite advanced relations with Ramat Hasharon, the tripartite arrangement was abandoned due to a peak in tensions during the second Intifada, between 2000 and 2005,"" explained Pottier Bianchi. ""Relations then became too tense between the two sides.""This failure did not, however, weaken the ties between the Dunkirk Urban Community (CUD), which comprises the city and 20 nearby municipalities, and Gaza. In 1996, the Gaza-Dunkirk association was created to support the community in its cooperation with the Palestinian enclave. Within two years, a library and an urban park (financed by the CUD) were inaugurated in Gaza. Cooperation continued with the hosting of several Palestinian students and the training of Gazan technicians in water management in Dunkirk. But two events put an end to this collaboration. The first was the victory of Hamas in the legislative elections in the Gaza Strip in 2006.",/en/m-le-mag/
Macron opens an umbrella: Does anyone care?,"At the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, the French president took part in the presentation of the Webb Ellis trophy to rugby world champions South Africa, and he was willing to share his little corner of the umbrella.","After 50 days, 48 games and many more refereeing errors, it is finally time to move on. The Rugby World Cup is over, with France frustrated and South Africa crowned. It all happened on Saturday, October 28, at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, north of Paris. Faced with New Zealand, the Springboks won by the narrowest margin (12-11), and then went off, under the rain and the gaze of Emmanuel Macron, to collect their precious trophy.The trophy in question is called the ""Webb Ellis Cup,"" in reference to the inventor of modern rugby. Inspired by a cup dating from 1740, it measures 38 centimeters, weighs 4.5 kilos and is made of gold-plated silver. More importantly, there are actually two Webb Ellis trophies. The original model dates from 1906 and its replica from 1986, with one or the other being awarded equally to the winners of the competition. So which one did the South Africans inherit? Rugby purists will argue that they deserve the replica – if even that.It was Siya Kolisi, the South African captain, who had the honor of guiding his team to the trophy, dressed in the traditional green jersey of the national team. One detail: On his chest was not the traditional springbok, an antelope and the symbol of the South African selection. Widely used during the era of racial segregation and considered a symbol of that period, the antelope has been replaced over the last 10 years by the protea, a typical South African plant. As a result, the springbok now only appears on one sleeve of the South African jersey.On the stage set up in the middle of the Stade de France pitch, Macron took out his umbrella and held out his arm to protect Kolisi from the rain. Nice? Yes, but risky too. In fact, an umbrella with a metal rod of this type conducts electricity and can therefore cause a great deal of damage in the event of a lightning strike. The solution? An umbrella with a wooden shaft, which is much safer and, incidentally, more elegant.The image of a president holding an umbrella finally reminds us that this accessory is not without political meaning. Former president François Hollande stubbornly refused to be protected from the rain during his speech on the Breton island Île de Sein in August 2014, as part of the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Liberation, in solidarity with the fallen soldiers. And his predecessor General de Gaulle briefed his inner circle to ostentatiously hand him an umbrella at the first drop of rain, only to refuse it with panache and bravery.",/en/m-le-mag/
Succession and betrayal in Charles de Gaulle's family,Long Read,"Philippe de Gaulle has devoted his life to managing a legacy. The thoughts, deeds and heritage of his father, Charles de Gaulle, have occupied him since the death on November 9, 1970, of the general who led Free France in World War Two and founded the Fifth Republic in 1958. For more than half a century, the admiral and his tall silhouette have stood guard over his father's legacy, from memoirs to political meetings, from official ceremonies to television broadcasts. The great man's image has pursued him even in the mirror, where every morning a fine mustache appears under a large nose just like his father's.The passing years might have given Philippe some respite, but he always finds things to do, even at 101.One morning in the winter of 2022, bent over on his walker, the heir left his room at the Invalides military hospital in Paris, where he lives, to go to the Museum of the Order of the Liberation, a few corridors away. One room is dedicated to Charles de Gaulle: it houses the canteen de Gaulle took with him when he left for London on June 17, 1940; his khaki uniform as leader of Free France, complete with jacket, pants and képi cap; and the Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Victoria presented to the French president by Queen Elizabeth II of England in 1960.Philippe de Gaulle now wants to entrust his father's military decorations to the museum. The centenarian told General Christian Baptiste, the national delegate of the Order of the Liberation, that it would be ""a deposit with no time limit.""He knows his time is short. Everyone around him has already gone. His wife, Henriette, has been waiting for him since 2014 under a tombstone in the cemetery in the town of Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises. The memorial is sober and gray, like the one on the other side of the path that houses Charles de Gaulle and his wife, Yvonne, as well as Philippe's sister, Anne, who had Down syndrome, and died at the age of 20, in 1948. His other sister, Elisabeth, was buried to the right of their parents, in 2013, along with her husband, the grand chancellor of the Legion of Honor and Free France hero Alain de Boissieu.Who will carry on the legacy when Philippe joins them? Politically speaking, the question doesn't come up: There's always someone to claim the legacy of ""the most illustrious of Frenchmen,"" in the words of René Coty, the general's predecessor at the Elysée Palace. Every year, the anniversary of his death is the pretext for a parade of politicians at Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises, although no major figures are expected to attend this year.",/en/m-le-mag/

In the background, half a dozen wooden boats are tied to the shore.The man smiling at Phillips in the photo goes by ""Caboco,"" or sometimes ""Caboclo."" He is known by Indigenous people in the region for illegally fishing on their territory. Phillips spent the months before his death working on a book titled How to Save the Amazon, about threats to the tropical rainforest. His interest in illegal fishing led to this trip. But Philips never had the chance to publish the book. Two days after this photo was taken, on June 5, 2022, the journalist and his guide, Bruno Pereira, were killed on the Itaquai River by illegal fishermen, members of the same group as ""Caboco.""This photo, one of the last taken of Phillips, was almost buried in the heart of the Amazon forever. Almost four months after the two men were murdered, Pereira's colleagues – members of an Indigenous patrol within the Union of Indigenous Peoples of the Javari Valley (Univaja) – discovered one of Pereira's phones under a pile of mud and sticks. On it was this photo.At the time of the discovery, the team was accompanied by journalist and member of the Forbidden Stories consortium, Sônia Bridi, who was making a documentary for TV Globo. ""His colleagues went back [to the crime scene] with a metal detector to find more evidence,"" Bridi told Forbidden Stories. ""They found Dom's glasses, his notebook – [which is] all wet, we can't read anything – his press card."" The team turned everything over to the federal police, Bridi added. This discovery contained crucial elements that helped reconstruct the last moments of the two men's lives and confirmed the sequence of events determined by police investigators.It took months of work to simply power on the phone and extract its data. Being able to access the photos was unexpected. ""The phone spent months in the water before the river levels went down,"" Bridi said. These final photos were entrusted to the 16 media organizations that make up the ""Bruno and Dom Project,"" led by Forbidden Stories, which is continuing the work of Pereira and Phillips on the destruction of the Amazon. Over the past year, this group of more than 50 journalists has investigated land grabbing, ranching's ties to deforestation, mining and illegal fishing – an investigation that ultimately cost these two defenders of the Amazon their lives.",/en/investigations/
Italy calls on the Louvre to return seven of its archaeological objects,    Investigations by archaeologists have led to the identification of half a dozen works of questionable provenance in the Paris museum's collections. ,"For lovers of Greek, Etruscan and Roman art, the Louvre's Galerie Campana, named after the marquis whose collection was acquired by Napoleon III, is an absolute must. Its rooms reopened to the public at the beginning of July after renovation. They are brimming with splendid relics of the ancient world. On display is an amphora on a black background, dating from the 5th century BC, attributed to the ""Berlin painter,"" one of the great masters of Greek pottery, whose style has been identified but whose identity is still unknown. On one side, a musician in profile plays the zither. On the other, a laurel-crowned figure extends his arm in an inviting gesture.The museum’s caption omits one detail. Le Monde, confirmed by the Louvre, found that the Italian state is reclaiming this object along with six other archaeological pieces.The museum purchased them between 1982 and 1998, at a time when curators the world over were focusing their attention on the authenticity of the works, forgetting to consider their provenance. A still ongoing inquiry could lead to a historic agreement between France and Italy in the autumn. Recognition of the Paris museum's problematic purchases did not come from out of nowhere, however. It has been some ten years since suspicion was first aroused and dialogue started between the two countries.The story goes back to 1995. In the secrecy of Geneva's free port, Swiss and Italian police raided the warehouse of a shady Italian merchant, Giacomo Medici, and came across an incredible haul. In addition to thousands of clandestinely excavated objects, the investigators discovered 5000 Polaroids, like inventory cards listing works at various stages, from exhumation to pre-sale restoration.This mass of documents, which served as evidence in a resounding trial in 2003, enabled the entire chain to be traced, from the tombaroli (""grave robbers""), hired hands who clandestinely unearthed the objects, to the auction houses and merchants. Those well-established dealers took it upon themselves to launder the freshly exhumed relics, selling them to museums and prestigious collectors.Gianfranco Becchina, a Sicilian antique dealer who owns the Palladion Gallery in Basel, is one of those. He is a supplier to American billionaire Shelby White, donor of the Metropolitan Museum, and her husband, Leon Levy, as well as to the Getty Villa in Malibu. But he also supplied the Louvre, who bought several important objects from him: a krater of suitors, a magnificent example of an antique vase by the painter of Ixion; another krater in the style of the Antimenes Painter, decorated with a mythological scene; and a pair of nereids (marine nymphs) from Puglia.",/en/investigations/
Gérard Depardieu: The decline of a sacred monster of French cinema,Investigation,"On Monday, April 10, Gérard Depardieu had an appointment with Intertalent, the artistic agency headed by the literary agent François Samuelson. It was no more than two kilometers from his Parisian hôtel particulier on Rue du Cherche-Midi to the agent's offices on Rue Gay-Lussac, almost in a straight line along the Jardin du Luxembourg. He traveled the distance on his scooter. How many neighbors see this imposing figure every day, without daring to approach him? Weighing in at 130 kilograms beneath that strange little helmet, whose straps he never fastens, he makes even the powerful Yamaha TMax look like a simple pétrolette, as they would call those flimsy 1950s mopeds in Châteauroux, his childhood town. The actor sometimes rides up the street in the wrong direction. All at once known, he is known to everyone, unattainable, linked to countless cinema memories – and out of line.His reason for visiting Samuelson could be summed up in one short sentence: ""Things are not going well for Michel Houellebecq,"" the writer's longtime agent warned him. After several critically acclaimed bestsellers, Houellebecq's reputation was gradually cracking under the weight of his provocations. From his blistering attacks on Islam, immigrants and feminists, to the porn film shot with his wife and broadcast without her permission, Houellebecq, who used to love controversy, could no longer stand his tarnished image.He and Depardieu hadn't seen each other since Guillaume Nicloux's film Thalasso (Just Great, 2019), in which they play two spa-goers at a thalassotherapy in Cabourg, Normandy, but the actor is well familiar with the pain of disenchantment. He, too, went from being an idolized titan to a man whose friends had given up trying to excuse all his faults.That day, at Intertalent, he grabbed one of his three cell phones and called Houellebecq. When the conversation ended, he immediately decided to pay him a visit. Just as he was about to go to the door and put on his helmet, Samuelson stopped him. As a matter of conscience, he wanted to make sure of one thing: ""Tell me Gérard, are you aware that tomorrow an investigation will be published by [investigative website] Mediapart, in which several women accuse you of sexual violence on film shoots?"" He grunted, shrugged, and then he was off again.For years, scandal trailed him, and for years, it did not stop him. Does he think this can keep up? That the dozens of masterpieces that made him the greatest French actor of the last 50 years can forever erase the injuries caused by his drunken motorcycle accidents, the groping of make-up artists and technical staff, the scenes of drunken violence on set requiring a doctor to quickly administer a sedative shot, the vociferous support for Vladimir Putin, and the photos showing him red-faced and grinning alongside dictators from around the world?",/en/investigations/
Uber Files: French Parliament Commission says government 'failed to enforce the law',"    One year after Le Monde and its partners' revelations about Uber's lobbying, French lawmakers condemned the authorities' weakness and Emmanuel Macron's complacency in a report published on Tuesday. ","How did a company with such contempt for the law benefit from so much leniency? The question repeatedly arises throughout a 500-page report by a commission of inquiry of the Assemblée Nationale into the Uber Files. Published on Tuesday, July 18, the document is the result of six months of work during which members of parliament interviewed up to 120 individuals. It highlights multiple shortcomings in how government services reacted to the development of Uber and other similar platforms in France.The case began with a series of articles published by Le Monde and its International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) partners in July last year, focusing on the transport platform's operations in France and beyond. The investigation was based on numerous internal documents sent to the British daily The Guardian by Mark MacGann, Uber's chief lobbyist for Europe, from 2014 to 2016. They reveal how the company deliberately circumvented regulations to gain a foothold against taxis and its influence strategy, particularly in France, where it forged a close relationship with President Emmanuel Macron when he was minister of the economy.Danielle Simonnet, an MP with the radical-left party La France Insoumise (LFI) and the main instigator of the commission, took up and extended these revelations in her report. It used the same documents but also drew on hearings of some key players in the case – except for former members of Macron's cabinet – and new, more recent evidence.Former Socialist prime minister Manuel Valls and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, both in office at the time of the Uber Files, told the commission the government stood firm when faced with the platform's ""total cynicism."" But they failed to convince MPs, who concluded instead authorities had ""failed to enforce the law."" Uber, they point out, launched its UberPop private-driver service in France from early 2014 to July 2015, at a time when it was blatantly unlawful. They also found two pieces of legislation passed during the mandate of former French president François Hollande in response to the platform's malpractices – the Thévenoud Law (2014) and the Grandguillaume Law (2016) – are still partly circumvented.According to the report, the fault lies with isolated and often inconclusive procedures. Jérôme Fournel, a top official at the finance ministry, acknowledged the lack of cooperation from the Dutch tax authorities and a slow bureaucracy restricted his ability to take action. The report also mentions the case of an inspection carried out by URSSAF (a network of private organizations in charge of collecting social security contributions), which was overturned in court due to a formal defect without the organization seeing fit to re-launch proceedings. It also cites the example of Nathalie Homobono, the head of a finance ministry competition body from 2009 to 2018, who admitted having discovered the company's tactics to sabotage controls and the work of the justice system after the Uber Files case was disclosed while saying it had not hindered its investigations.",/en/investigations/
"Looking for Roman Abramovich, the human chameleon",Investigation,"The meeting, we were told, would be in suite 1288 at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Herzliya, an upmarket northern suburb of Tel Aviv, Israel. But there was a problem: The room doesn't exist. ""Excuse my indiscretion,"" said a member of the hotel staff, near the pool, ""Are you looking for the Russian gentleman with bodyguards?"" Yes. Roman Abramovich, 56, the powerful oligarch reputedly close to President Vladimir Putin. As if by magic, a door opened at the end of the corridor. Inside, there was no trace of the billionaire, who had come to the Israeli coast to spend the summer with his entourage. He hasn't spoken to the press for a long time, and that stormy June afternoon would be no exception.Instead, one of the businessman's long-standing associates, Henry, and his spokesperson for the past eight years, Olga (their names were changed at their request), welcomed us to a chilly white décor and a private terrace overlooking the sea. With a can of Diet Coke and a pack of cigarettes on the table, Olga told the stories of her Russian-Lebanese-Swedish origins, of her violent father, and the daughter she is raising alone, supported by her boss. ""Her birth coincided with the pandemic, and we lived in an apartment next to Stamford Bridge, Chelsea's deserted stadium,"" she said, referring to the London-based football club owned by Abramovich from 2003 to 2022. ""Roman insisted that I continue to work for him, even if it meant taking my baby to meetings. He likes to surround himself with colleagues who, like him, have been through a lot.""From the mid-1990s, a coterie of a dozen people has followed the tycoon at almost every stage in the construction of his empire: his oil ventures, in Russia; his political career in Chukotka, the country's easternmost region; his London life; and the many start-ups and vast real estate holdings in which he has invested in Israel. Not one member of his loyal clan has ever betrayed the oligarch whose fortune is estimated at a little over $9 billion, down from $14.5 billion in 2021. ""I would never work for anyone else,"" said Henry, formerly of an American investment bank, and who has long worked with the Russian. He lauded Abramovich's ""sixth sense"" and his obsession with results. According to him, the oligarch is constantly looking to ""fix things,"" without ever seeking ""the slightest attention.""Attentive but shunning attention: such is this billionaire's paradox. A key figure in modern Russia, preferring behind-the-scenes discretion to taking center stage, he has nevertheless become the most famed and secretive of the so-called oligarchs – the entrepreneurs who profited from privatizations by cozying up to the Kremlin, when the Eastern bloc disintegrated. His fame is the result of his extraordinary career trajectory, which kept pace with Russia's evolutions, from perestroika to Putin's authoritarian drift. At age 3, he was an orphan of a Soviet-Jewish family; later he became the patron of the cultural avant-garde and the Jewish community. Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine, he is even a discreet diplomat. He knows how to make himself indispensable.",/en/investigations/
"Roman Abramovich the 'invisible man,' a business and survival specialist",Investigation,"Roman Abramovich had never revealed his face. He had never let anyone photograph him. In the late 1990s, when his name flooded the Russian media, the young oligarch remained invisible. The press had to commission rough illustrations of the businessman, who ran the oil giant Sibneft, employing tens of thousands of people across the country. ""During a lecture the politician Boris Nemtsov delivered at Oxford University in 1998, he was even asked if Abramovich really existed,"" said Nigel Gould-Davis, a former British diplomat in Russia (2003-2007) and ambassador to Belarus (2007-2009).Also in 1998, the NTV channel launched a competition for its viewers to debunk conspiracy theories, offering a prize of 1 million rubles (around $2,000) for the very first photo of the enigmatic 30-something. Less than two months later, NTV received a photo, but the man in the picture had a mustache: It wasn't Abramovich. The prize would ultimately be won thanks to a blurry photo, where the tycoon's face, calm eyes, his composed demeanor were barely even discernible. It was enough to make headlines in every paper. He had become a public figure.Behind the scenes, the businessman had the best allies, and secured a prominent place among the national elite. In 1996, President Boris Yeltsin was re-elected for a second four-year term. Together with Boris Berezovsky, Abramovich had financed part of his campaign, with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in charge of gathering the funds. Abramovich began spending entire days in the Kremlin's corridors with Tatyana Dyachenko, the president's daughter. The 36-year-old former Soviet aerospace worker acted as an informal adviser to her father, a role inspired by Claude Chirac's position alongside her father Jacques Chirac, the French president who came to Moscow on an official visit at that time.As Yeltsin's health declined after multiple heart attacks, his youngest daughter asserted herself in the various power struggles. The ""tsarina"" and""little princess of the Kremlin,"" as she was nicknamed by the press, consolidated the support of loyal followers, including Alexander Voloshin, the deputy head of the presidential administration, and Valentin Yumashev, Yeltsin's new spokesman, who Dyachenko married in 2001. Yumashev, a journalist and author of the president's memoirs, became friends with Abramovich as soon as they met in 1994, at the home of Boris Gryzlov, Vladimir Putin's future interior minister. ""Together with the restaurateur Arkady Novikov, they sometimes cooked shashlik, meat brochettes,"" said Yuri Feklistov, a photographer who was close to Yumachev. ""Valentin introduced him to me as his 'friend Roman, one of the richest in Russia,' in 1997.""",/en/investigations/
Roman Abramovich's new promised land,Investigation,"Roman Abramovich's biggest yacht is called Eclipse, a reminder of how much he likes to lurk in the shadows. But on May 29, 2021, the oligarch's joy was expressed out in the open. In front of photographers at Porto's Dragon Stadium, he posed radiantly alongside two of his seven children, Arkadiy and Aaron. The team he bought in 2003, Chelsea Football Club, had just won its second Champions League.It was the first time in almost three years that the businessman had appeared alongside his players. While the UK had long welcomed Russian money with open arms, conditions were tightened after the attempted poisoning of double agent Sergei Skripal in March 2018. Abramovich immediately paid the price: His visa was not renewed. He was left with no choice but to follow his team's matches on television, from abroad.His public reappearance on the Porto pitch drew significant attention. Newspapers gossiped about the symbolism of his victory on the home turf of José Mourinho, the most petulant coach in Chelsea's history. Nobody knew that Portugal was now the Chelsea owner's home. One month before the final, on April 30, 2021, Abramovich had officially become a citizen of the country, in the greatest secrecy.The Russian made use of a law on the return of Sephardic Jews, passed in 2013 and enacted in 2015, granting citizenship to any Jew who can prove they belong to this community. The legislation was meant as a belated attempt from Portugal to repair the damage done to the community during the reign of Manuel I (1469-1521), when Jews suffered from pogroms, expulsions, and forced conversions to Christianity. Incidentally, it was also an opportunity for the country to attract new investors, after being bled dry by the 2008 economic crisis.The prospect of becoming a citizen of the European Union boosted the number of applicants. As a result, the Portuguese government and the Jewish communities of Lisbon and Porto were overwhelmed. To date, almost 200,000 passport applications have been submitted; by the end of 2021, 57,000 had been accepted.These neo-Portuguese come in all shapes and sizes: footballers, a former head of Mossad (Israel's intelligence service), rabbis, and some very wealthy people. One of them was the Russian businessman, whose biographies until then all suggested – wrongly, if he is to be believed – that he belonged to the Ashkenazi, not Sephardic, branch of Judaism.""One day, someone advised me to look up Roman Abramovich's Portuguese Wikipedia page,"" said Paulo Curado, the journalist from the newspaper Publico who broke the story in November 2021. ""It was much longer than the English version; it was the only one, incidentally, to mention his Sephardic origins... After investigating, I found that his application had been processed in record time.""",/en/investigations/
"Roman Abramovich, from art lover to patron of Russian culture",Investigation,"For a long time, Israel Bartov was the head of counterterrorism for the Shabak, Israel's internal security service (formerly known as the Shin Beth). Though is now retired, he apologized for not being able to share any information about Roman Abramovich. He added a cryptic formula: ""Secrets must be revealed, and mysteries solved."" Former French footballer Marcel Desailly, who rubbed shoulders with the Russian oligarch at Chelsea Football Club, was no more forthcoming: ""Roman Abramovich? Hmm... Sorry. Sensitive subject.""Investigating a man of power means facing refusals to answer questions, and this series of articles was no exception. Most of the nyets we received, however, were accompanied by messages conveying a mixture of fear and fascination. It is as if Abramovich's aura extended beyond his main areas of activity – business, politics, sport – and flirted with arts and culture stars. The Russian businessman knows this world well, having sponsored it profusely over the past 15 years. Thanks to the artists he has helped and financed, he has measured the extent to which celebrity is shrouded in secrecy – a paradox that he has gradually made into a rule to live by.Kirill Serebrennikov would know about that. In May 2022, Russia's most high-profile film director made his comeback to the Cannes Film Festival. He had not been able to climb the festival's steps in 2018 and 2019, because he was under house arrest in his country. At the press conference, most of the questions were not about his films or his run-ins with the law, but about Abramovich's unwavering support for him. The star of the day was not the artist whose pro-LGBT and anti-war commitments had earned him the wrath of the regime, but his enigmatic patron, the man who had shunned the press for decades.On the Croisette, journalists rehashed more or less the same questions, stirred up by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February: What prompted the oligarch reputedly close to Vladimir Putin to finance the films and shows of such a non-conformist artist? Why, in early 2022, did he pay the bulk of the fine – 129 million rubles (nearly €1.3 million) – imposed on Serebrennikov, effectively giving him back his freedom of movement and creation? ""Abramovich, you can’t understand anything about him,"" the director told Le Monde, with a hint of fatalism. ""He has something inaccessible, unattainable. It fascinates everyone.""If we are to go by what has emerged from his biography, culture has always interested Abramovich. Orphaned at the age of 3 and having never earned a diploma, he discovered it through encounters and contracts. Thanks to his first profits at the time of the liberalization of the Russian economy at the turn of the 1990s, he acquired state-of-the-art hi-fi equipment: record and cassette players, headphones. That was when he began his first art collection. ""When I went to visit him in Moscow for the first time some 15 years ago, Roman showed me his Soviet porcelain,"" recounted Russian visual artist Emilia Kabakov. ""He had been collecting them for almost 20 years.""",/en/investigations/
Harry in his little navy polo shirt: Does anyone care?,"On October 22, Prince Harry attended the Formula 1 Grand Prix held on the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. It was an opportunity to see that, at 39, his highness is chasing his youth.","Living life in the fast lane? On October 22, far, far removed from the royal mundanities and ceremonial obligations that have punctuated (or spoiled, some would say) his life for years, Prince Harry attended the Formula 1 Grand Prix held on the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. The occasion included a visit to the pits of the reigning world champion team, Red Bull, and a chat with its boss, Britain's Christian Horner, pictured here on the right.On that day, Prince Harry donned a navy polo shirt and a pair of dark blue denim jeans, giving shape to a monochrome silhouette sorely lacking in relief and interest, but allowing us at least one historical remark: Now the default color of all men's wardrobes in recent years, navy is a color only recently put to use. Before the mid-20th century, navy was rarely worn outside of sailors' outfits, as gray crushed everything in its path.His Highness also wore a series of fancy bracelets on his right wrist. The first was made of wooden beads, the second of metal, the third of leather adorned with a thread of pistachio-green wool. Gri-gri? Lucky charm? Pure coquetry? No, mid-life crisis. At 39, and like more and more men, Prince Harry has been loading up his wrist with trinkets to show off his cool and slow down the fading of his youth. Spoiler: It doesn't work.Was 49-year-old Horner also wearing a series of bracelets on his right wrist? We'd bet he was, but in the absence of proof, we'll settle for noting that the Red Bull team boss was wearing another piece frequently requisitioned by 40-somethings in search of reassurance: skinny jeans, weighted down with elastane and adorned with a particularly pronounced artificial patina. Neither of these, of course, should be worn.Finally, with all those laminated plastic accreditations hanging around their necks, with their gleaming cords and sharp corners, how can we not return to this magnificent story from almost 20 years ago, which older football fans may remember? In 2004, a few hours before the Euro kick-off, French national team player Steve Marlet accidentally caught his accreditation tag in the eye. Suffering a torn cornea, he was unable to take part in the competition, the only major tournament for which he was called up by Les Bleus.

Monaco shaken by investigations into members of Albert II's entourage,"    In mid-July, Monaco's judiciary carried out a series of searches at the homes of four figures reputedly close to the prince and his late father, which could cast a shadow over the family. ","In Monaco, scandal is on the doorstep of the prince's palace. The struggle for influence between a billionaire – local real estate magnate Patrice Pastor – and four men long reputed to be close to Prince Albert II, seems to be turning to the former's advantage. The prince, for his part, has found himself in the middle of a battle whose collateral damage could seriously shake the wealthy micro-state.Following a series of searches carried out in mid-July, Monaco's justice system now has the files of 67-year-old chartered accountant Claude Palmero. An influential yet discreet figure in the principality for two decades, this seasoned manager is the soul of discretion. From November 2001 to June 2023, he held the sensitive position of administrator of the prince of Monaco's assets, and as such, was the keeper of all the principality's secrets – from the prince's personal accounts to government investments. He is the kind of person whose good side you usually try to stay on.His recent ousting on June 6, when he was cited by a mysterious website called ""Les Dossiers du Rocher"", has changed the situation: Under judicial scrutiny, Palmero has become the man who is making the palace quiver. His files, along with the contents of his cell phone, are now in the hands of three of Monaco's investigating judges, and may well speak for him.These items were seized on Wednesday, July 19 during a series of large-scale searches carried out not only in Monaco but also in Nice and Paris, as part of international letters rogatory. In addition to Palmero, whose offices, private home, and second residence were searched, three other figures reputedly close to the prince, and now in disgrace, were targeted by police operations: Thierry Lacoste, lawyer, and childhood friend of Albert II, Didier Linotte, president of the supreme court – a kind of local Constitutional Council, and Laurent Anselmi, former head of the prince's cabinet, who was also dismissed in June.This judicial offensive came as a surprise to the four men, who see themselves as victims of a machination hatched by the sponsors of the ""Dossiers du Rocher,"" of which they are, in fact, the targets. In the spring of 2022, Le Monde reported in detail on this incredible operation of manipulation and digital allegation, with the juicy local real estate market as a backdrop.Presented by ""Les Dossiers du Rocher"" as members of a supposedly corrupt ""club of four,"" against a backdrop of thirst for real estate, Palmero and his friends filed a flurry of complaints for ""public defamation"" and ""slanderous allegations,"" as well as ""violation of the confidentiality of correspondence,"" since their e-mail boxes were hacked. They also filed complaints for ""forgery and use of forgeries"" because false bank statements had been posted online.",/en/investigations/
El Salvador in the grip of the 'Bukele system',Investigation,"Nayib Bukele has won a war. The Salvadoran president often boasts on Twitter: ""We're not the same anymore."" Four years of ""Bukeleism"" have changed the face of El Salvador. Its 6.6 million nationals adore him, someot idolize him. He succeeded where all the others failed in defeating the pandillas, the gangs that have bloodied the country – and the Central American region – for more than two decades. Almost every day, Bukele tweets to his 5.2 million followers: ""Another day with zero homicides,"" an assertion that has an undeniable impact when seven years earlier, there were almost 20 murders a day in the country.The changes were noticeable when strolling through the streets of San Salvador, the capital. That day, children were playing football in a square. A couple was about to enjoy a drink on a terrace. A woman visited a friend. These scenes of everyday life were unthinkable just two years ago when gangs were sowing terror, extorting money from businesses, controlling entrances and exits to neighborhoods, threatening residents, and even banning the brands of sneakers worn by rival gangs.The turning point came on March 27, 2022. After a particularly deadly weekend – authorities reported 87 murders – that undermined his stated policy of reducing crime, the president declared a war on gangs, greeted by the applause of an exasperated population. He also declared a state of emergency, which is still in force today. He deployed the army in the streets, surrounded entire towns to root out gang members, the pandilleros, and threw 70,000 people into prison. As a result, 1.6% of the population is now behind bars, the highest incarceration rate in the world. One year and three months later, the facts are striking. The investigative website El Faro verified this by visiting 14 towns previously under criminal groups' thumb. ""The gangs do not exist at this moment as El Salvador knew them for decades,"" it writes.Bukele, 41, is delighted. In the past, El Faro vilified his strategy against the pandilleros and the international community urged him to respect the rights of the detainees. ""Let all the 'human rights' non-governmental organizations know we will wipe out these bloody murderers and their collaborators. We will put them in prison, and they will never get out,"" he tweeted again on May 17, after the murder of a police officer. Under his tweet were hundreds of replies from ministers, lawmakers, civil servants, journalists close to the government, and influencers, all determined to applaud, even praise, the most beloved president of the American continent. A CID Gallup study recently reported he enjoys a 92% popularity rating.",/en/investigations/
How the Russian propaganda machine works in Africa,"    The Wagner Group has conquered the continent with the help of its mercenaries, as well as fake news outlets and influencers, drawing on a strong rejection of the West in general – and France in particular. ","In the early hours of the Russia-Africa summit, a rumor was gaining ground: Was Yevgeny Prigozhin in St. Petersburg to work behind the scenes on the meeting that would take place on Thursday, July 27, and Friday, July 28? Suspicions intensified further when one of the Wagner leader's loyal lieutenants, Dmitry Sytyi, in charge of the paramilitary group's political and civil operations in Bangui, posted a photo of Prigozhin and a Central African official, captioned: ""We see familiar faces"" – although it could not be determined when the image was taken.Whether there in the flesh or not, the man who led an unsuccessful rebellion against Russia a month ago was a key player in the second edition of the summit organized by Vladimir Putin, as he played a vital role in Russia's expansion in Africa. ""Africa is a region of the world where the interests of all global powers converge. A state's position on the international stage depends directly on its influence on the African continent,"" wrote the Wagner Group in 2019, in an internal memo seen by Le Monde.Prigozhin's conquest of certain African countries has been achieved not only by his mercenaries but also by his bots and troll machines, which secured Russia's first victory: That of the mind. From Niamey, where protesters called for welcoming the Russians after the military coup, to Kinshasa, where the streets are adorned with the country's flags, the continent has never seemed so pro-Russian and anti-French.Since the first Russia-Africa summit in Sochi in 2019, Prigozhin has set up a sophisticated propaganda machine to try and restore his country's diplomatic influence, lost a quarter of a century ago with the collapse of the USSR. Its objective was to promote the ""dissemination of information about Russian and Soviet support to African countries in their struggle for independence"" and the ""formation of negative attitudes towards European powers and the United States,"" as stated in the aforementioned internal document.The Wagner Group has applied this tactic, to varying degrees, in all the countries where it has sold its services. In the Central African Republic and Mali, for instance, Russian propaganda took root in the fertile ground, characterized by a strong Pan-African sentiment and a rejection of the West.Weaving a disinformation network with the help of companies like Africa Politology (sanctioned by the US Treasury in January), Wagner relied on Russian influencers to disseminate its ideas, and then on African political players, taking advantage of precarious political situations, such as coups d'état and elections.

Video: How Ukraine's army withstood Russia throughout one year of war,   ,"One year ago, on February 24, 2022, many were worried about a lightning victory for the Russian army, which sprang into action to fulfill President Vladimir Putin's ""special operation"" in Ukraine.In less than a week, Russian troops were 40 kilometers away from Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. But one year later, the situation on the frontline seems to have come to some kind of standstill. Ukraine has regained a large part of its territory once occupied by Russia.How was Ukraine able to reconquer so much territory? How did Ukraine's military manage to resist that of Russia's, which was reputed to be vastly superior, both in numbers and in equipment?Thanks to verified images from on the ground and analyses by international experts, Le Monde's video department looked back on the year of war in Ukraine, and how Ukraine was able to take advantage, at least temporarily, of the Russian army's failures.Sources cited in the video:Royal United Services Institute report on Ukraine's war strategy from February to July 2022Eyes On Russia project (interactive map of verified videos and photos) by the Center for Information Resilience and C4ADSInstitute Study of WarLe Monde interactive map on the evolving frontline in Ukraine (in French)Official specifications for the CaesarOfficial specifications for the HIMARSFeatures for the Javelin and the NLAWThe independent blog Oryx, which counts material losses on both sides, as well as Western deliveriesThe Twitter accounts Orion Intel (independent analyst), Ukraine Weapons Tracker (independent analysts) and Rob Lee (researcher)The New York Times (09/10/2022) on US intelligence shared with Ukrainian officialsConflict Armament Research report on the use of Russian cruise missiles in attacks in UkraineUnited Nations report (December 2022) on civilian deaths in Ukraine",/en/videos/
Video investigation: How a French company is supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine,   ,"""A huge thank you to schoolchildren in Samara. The donations that you collected for us have reached us."" The man addressing the camera, in late December 2022, is a soldier of the ""Donetsk People's Republic,"" affiliated with the Russian army. Dressed in camouflage, he stands in front of a destroyed building in Donetsk, only 20 kilometers from the front line. Around him, dozens of boxes, sleeping bags, camouflage netting – and packaging from Auchan and Leroy Merlin, two brands owned by France’s Mulliez Group.Le Monde, along with Christo Grozev, former Executive Director at Bellingcat, and Russian investigative website The Insider, got access to internal emails and eyewitness accounts in Auchan's Russian branch and verified photos and videos published on social media.Our investigation shows how goods sold by two companies belonging to the Mulliez Group – Auchan and Leroy Merlin – supply Russian armed forces on the Ukrainian front. In the case of Auchan, Le Monde's investigation reveals how the company's northern division itself organized the collection of Auchan products in Saint Petersburg for several tens of thousands of euros, just one month after the war began.",/en/videos/
How 'Le Monde' recreated De Gaulle's lost 1940 call for France to resist,   ,"On June 18, 1940, Charles de Gaulle gave one of the greatest speeches in French history. From a BBC studio in London, the general called for the French to resist Nazi occupation: ""Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not and will not be extinguished!"" However, no film or recording exists of it.What did General de Gaulle's appeal sound like? What did the French men and women who heard it that day actually hear?With the help of historians and researchers in ethics, Le Monde tried to get as close as possible to what this speech could have been thanks to historical documentation, a tailor-made interpretation by French actor and director François Morel and new technologies of vocal synthesis, assisted by artificial intelligence.A collaboration between Le Monde, l'Institut de recherche et coordination acoustique/musique (the Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music, Ircam) and the technology company Ircam Amplify.Synthesized voices: Ircam Amplify/Sound Analysis and Synthesis Team - STMS Laboratory (IRCAM, CNRS, Sorbonne University, ministry of culture).

Cameroon: How loggers skirt government control,"    'Cameroon's law of the jungle' (1/3). Over the course of a year, Le Monde and InfoCongo met dozens of people involved in the timber trade. Interviews and official documents reveal the authorities' inability to curb the unregulated exploitation of lumber. ","It was 2:25 am in Yaoundé. Two trucks loaded with logs sped along a tarmac road in the Emana district. Dozens do this every night, going from the forested regions in the south, east, or center of the country, and crossing Cameroon's capital. The timber loads all look the same, except for one detail. Some logs are marked, whereas others aren't, like the two trucks seen in the early hours in Emana.While transporting timber at night in built-up areas is permitted in Cameroon, moving ""logs without the regulatory markings outlined in the specifications"" is prohibited. The prohibition does not prevent the many trucks loaded with unmarked timber from passing through the checkpoints manned by police forces, customs officers, and forestry ministry agents. And there's a reason: ""Every official knows you're coming,"" according to Derek,* a logging truck driver who says the officials are warned of their arrival and let them through.Since 2008, the man in his 40s has traveled hundreds of kilometers every week for deliveries to sawmills in Vietnam and China, and to the ports of Douala and Kribi. Derek is no stranger to transporting illegal timber, nicknamed warap in the trade. Cargoes are made up of wood that is authorized for export but cut without permission. These are logs harvested without respecting trunk diameter – which indicates the tree's growth rate – or species that are prohibited from being cut or exported.Over the course of a year, Le Monde and InfoCongo met dozens of timber traffickers, local residents, and illegal log drivers in Cameroon. Their testimonies, along with official documents from the Ministry of Forests and Wildlife (which declined to answer our questions), show that illegal logging is gaining momentum.According to Derek and his colleague Raoul,* whom we met in November 2022 in Yaoundé, the people behind the schemes are often influential figures. They may be businessmen, army or government officials, or members of parliament, who pay or use their authority to operate under the radar. A few days before we met, Derek was delivering timber cut illegally in the central forests to a sawmill run by Vietnamese in the Ahala district of Yaoundé. ""It was for a colonel,"" he said.Derek, who is the father of a large family, knows these details because he's learned to take precautions after working in the industry. For example, the ""colonel"" held a ""video call from his office to reassure [him]."" ""Here's my contact, if you have any problems, I'll sort it out,"" he allegedly promised. The customer ""manages everything, pays, takes down the registrations and sends them by WhatsApp"" to the checkpoints, added Raoul. According to the drivers, most of their deliveries are made to Vietnamese sawmills, which launder them for export via the ports of Douala and Kribi.",/en/investigations/

"In Iran, five months of revolt filmed by the people",Investigation,"We know what the spark was. One dead body too many, and the Islamic Republic was shaken in the face of a popular revolt that suddenly threatened to turn into a revolution and ignited all corners of the country, even in the basements of the University of Tehran. During these weeks and now months of tumult, videos provide first-hand accounts. Although this filmed record has so much meaning for those who courageously ensure its distribution, the footage is sometimes relatively unclear when taken out of context.Outside the country, two Iranian experts, Farzad Seifikaran and Payam Elhami, have undertaken the task of putting together the scattered pieces of this patchwork of a movement. Seifikaran is an investigative journalist, and Elhami is a data specialist. Together, they work hard to go through social media, in search of all the video material in circulation. They store them, sift through them, determine their origin and cross-reference their content with others to geolocate them. They are not cinematic masterpieces and their quality reflects the immediacy and danger. Their strength lies in the imperative need of their anonymous creators to show what is happening. A collective effort was needed to grasp the meaning and the scope of this major collection.In the vast scene that emerges, it is not just a question of violence and repression. The shots are also those of celebrations, of moments of collective liberation. Men and women dance in the streets around a fire. How can you not be gripped when protesters start singing ""Bella Ciao"" at a funeral? How can you not understand the message, with its universal nature, its references that extend beyond Iran, and tell of the great song of freedom that spans time and continents?Le Monde has decided to take part in a project whose objective is to keep open a window into a movement in danger of obliteration. We are publishing the videos with verification and context so that a wide audience can grasp the momentum, the insights and the revealing moments. This work does not claim to give an exhaustive account of the situation. How can it? Independent media that could operate undisturbed in Iran or go to the country with no hindrances would make this platform, which by definition does not contain a plurality of viewpoints, obsolete. This project is intended to share a piece of history that is also a form of resistance to the fear of seeing the current movement discredited by the authorities.Mahsa Amini was only 22 years old when she died. She lived in Saqqez, a Kurdish town in northwestern Iran, and had traveled to Tehran with her family to visit the capital. On September 13, 2022, she was arrested by the morality police. At the time of her detention, her brother begged the police not to take her away. ""We don't know anyone here,"" he told them. The young woman fell into a coma while in police custody, presumably due to blows to the head. Her hospitalization was made public by Iranian journalists including Niloufar Hamedi, who, working for the Iranian newspaper Shargh, published a photo of the girl's parents embracing in the empty corridor of Kasra Hospital in northern Tehran.",/en/videos/
Victor Wembanyama: Can basketball players be too tall?,   ,"For the past few months, basketball fans around the world have been raving about the games of a young 19-year-old French player: Victor Wembanyama.Commentators see him as a ""prodigy"" and have already promised his career will be historic. The first thing you notice about him is that, at 7'2"", he is very tall. But, he's also particularly agile, fast, and skillful. A rare mix in basketball where, contrary to widespread belief, taller players are not necessarily the best.Certainly, their size allows them to take advantage of certain situations around the basket. But they are also often considered less agile, slower, and more fragile. To understand why, it is necessary to take a look at the biomechanics of the sport.Sources:",/en/videos/
Roman Abramovich's life as a gentleman in Londongrad,Investigation,"For once, the money and the connections did not suffice. At the beginning of March 2022, Roman Abramovich announced that Chelsea Football Club was up for sale. For the Russian billionaire, it was heartbreaking. Since he bought the London club in 2003, it has won 21 trophies, including five Premier League titles and two Champions Leagues. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 brought his special relationship with Vladimir Putin back into the media spotlight. Abramovich was sanctioned by the British parliament, and his club was seized. On March 5, during a match against Burnley, Chelsea supporters interrupted a minute of applause in support of Ukraine. They chanted the owner's name, over and over again. The Blues' coach, Thomas Tuchel, admonished them about their lack of solidarity with the country invaded by Russia, to no avail. For months on end, the fans showed their loyalty to the oligarch, even during the negotiations with an American investment fund, which ultimately bought the club for €5.2 billion.At Chelsea's helm, Abramovich formed what supporters called the Roman Empire. On May 22, 2022, for the final match of the season at Stamford Bridge, their stadium, they prepared a banner to be unfurled at the end of the match. According to David Johnstone, who has supported the Blues since the 1970s, the club then ""begged"" them to abandon the project, in order to avoid causing the failure of the sale to a group of investors led by the American Todd Bohely. Reluctantly, the fans put away the banner. On a midnight-blue background, with the oligarch's face drawn in white, it read: ""Thank you, Mr. Abramovich. Thanks to you, we've won everything.""In the early 2000s, the football enthusiast, who had attended the 1998 World Cup in France, asked the UBS bank to identify the best football opportunities throughout Europe. ""We were interested in Germany, Italy and France, in particular OGC Nice,"" said Henry, one of his long-standing associates (whose name was changed, at his request). There was nothing for sale. In England, the oil magnate had his eye on Manchester United, impressed by their victorious return match against Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals in 2003. But without success. Then there was Chelsea, the upmarket West London team on the verge of bankruptcy. In July 2003, after rapid negotiations, Abramovich paid £140 million (around €200 million at the time) to purchase the club.Was it only the love of football that motivated such an investment? In her book Les Hommes de Poutine (""Putin's Men"", 2022), the journalist Catherine Belton suggests that the club was bought at Vladimir Putin's request, something that Abramovich has always categorically denied – he even took the author to court over the matter. Another theory is that, by settling in London, the businessman felt better protected from Putin, who has been making and breaking Russian fortunes since he took power in 1999. Abramovich's personal accounts were very healthy: In 2005, he sold his oil flagship, Sibneft, to the state-owned conglomerate Gazprom for almost €11 billion – 130 times the sum he had paid for it in 1995.",/en/investigations/
Video: Will pulling CO2 from the air really save the climate?,Investigation,"The concept is simple: Suck air into a machine, extract the CO2, and release the clean air back into the atmosphere.According to one of the executives of the American oil company Oxy, this technique for removing carbon dioxide is also revolutionary: ""Direct atmospheric capture (DAC) is a Swiss Army knife – it can solve basically anything climate-related issue."" Seduced, European aeronautics giant Airbus has already purchased from Oxy the equivalent of 400,000 tons of CO2 to be removed from the atmosphere to offset its own greenhouse emissions.Le Monde, with the help of the climate investigation organization Aria, investigated the reality of Oxy's climate ambitions, and the true role that direct air capture can play in the energy transition.If it is to play a role, it remains a minor one and is of real interest only alongside a genuine green transition by oil giants like Oxy. Thanks to information from unpublished documents, Le Monde's investigation shows how, contrary to what Oxy claims, the oil company is not committed to this transition. On the contrary, it plans to increase its oil and gas production in the coming years.Sources in this document.",/en/videos/
Video investigation: How a French demonstrator ended up in a coma at water reservoir protest,   ,"Thousands of grenades, Molotov cocktails, and hundreds of injured: on March 25, 2023, in Sainte-Soline, western France, a demonstration against a ""mega-basin,"" or large water reserve, turned into a clash between police and protesters. At least two demonstrators, including Serge Duteuil-Graziani, a 32-year-old activist, were seriously injured. What happened?Dozens of hours of video footage captured that day and testimonies collected by Le Monde's video investigation unit show that the demonstrator, on the front line of the clashes, was probably hit by an illegal tear gas grenade shot from one of the areas where the gendarmes were positioned. The analyzed footage also proves that Serge Duteuil-Graziani was not hit at that moment by projectiles shot by other demonstrators.Le Monde's investigation also reveals, thanks to unpublished images by Brut journalist Camille Courcy, another illegal shot toward another demonstrator:  A shot made too horizontally and carried out with the most powerful propulsion device, which hit this demonstrator in the head.",/en/videos/
How Roman Abramovich got hold of the USSR's oil,Investigation,"Everything had been thought through, and the risk factors carefully weighed. In the mid-1980s, Roman Abramovich was doing his military service in an artillery unit in Kirzhach, some 100 kilometers east of Moscow. But his salary of seven rubles a month was not enough. The Red Army conscript was 20 years old and wanted more.In one of the few photos of him at the time, he is seen posing in uniform, his chapka slightly askew, a shy, enigmatic smile on his lips. It was at the time of perestroika, the ""restructuration"" program that allowed the Soviet Union to start tasting capitalism.To get his piece of the pie, Abramovich hatched a plan that was as inventive as it was lucrative. He persuaded several drivers of military vehicles to regularly siphon off a few liters of petrol from their tanks. ""He didn't even do it himself,” his friend Nikolai Panteleimonov told the Russian tabloid Zhizn in 2007. ""He had recruited a small team who usually operated at night.""In addition to a share in the profits, Roma, as his comrades called him, incentivized his accomplices by offering them ice cream and pastries. The cans were left in a forest outside the base, and then collected by a second group of soldiers, who sold them to the company's officers at half the market price. No one denounced the scheme: From one end of the chain to the other, everyone profited, especially the young entrepreneur, who pocketed a healthy share of the profits. Panteleimonov summed up his friend's talent, in Zhizn in 2007: ""Roman Abramovich could make money from nothing.""Unlike most oligarchs, who became rich through the privatization of state enterprises after the fall of the USSR, the future billionaire did not grow up among the dignitaries of the Soviet regime. His family history, which he has hardly ever mentioned in public, spans the darkest pages of the 20th century: the Holocaust and the Gulag.At the outbreak of the Second World War, his mother, Irina Mikhailenko, had to flee her native Kyiv, in Ukraine, just before the Nazi invasion. Some of her relatives, determined to stay put, were among the 33,771 Jews murdered on September 29 and 30, 1941 by the Einsatzgruppen at the edge of the Babi Yar ravine. At the same time, the family of Roman's father, Arkadiy Abramovich, was forced to leave Lithuania because they were Jewish and labeled ""capitalists"" – Arkadiy's father, Nachman, was a prosperous merchant. The Abramovichs were soon dispatched to various labor camps in Siberia. Nachman died there in 1942. His wife and sons, including the young Arkadiy, remained in detention for over a decade until the mid-1950s.",/en/investigations/
China and Taiwan: Is a conflict inevitable?,   ,"Since the end of the Chinese civil war and the nationalists' retreat to Taiwan in 1949, it has been the Chinese Communist Party's historic mission to merge the island into its territory, in the name of its ""One-China"" policy.While Chinese President Xi Jinping has stated that he will achieve this peacefully, he does not rule out the use of force. This threat became dangerously clear when the Chinese army engaged in large-scale military drills around the island, as it did in early April 2023 and in August 2022. Both times, a third actor was involved in the escalation of tensions: the United States, as the close ties between Taipei and Washington irritate Beijing. At the heart of these tensions lies the question of a potential American intervention in the event of a Chinese invasion.In this episode of our ""World Maps"" video series, Le Monde's video team examines the reasons behind the tensions between China and Taiwan, as well as the possibilities and implications of a conflict, if one were to occur. We do this with the help of researchers Antoine Bondaz, at France's Foundation for Strategic Research, and Ian Easton, at the Project 2049 Institute.Sources:",/en/videos/

Redouane died, Coisne lost his eye, and Duteuil-Graziani is still between life and death, over two months after his injury.The Cougar grenade launcher is a key weapon used by French law enforcement, yet it is designed to prevent injury on impact. To do so, it must be fired at a certain angle, as specified by its manufacturer, the French company Alsetex.Le Monde consulted internal documents from the national police and gendarmerie, analyzed images of 331 shots fired by police officers and gendarmes, and produced a 3D model of the behavior of a Cougar grenade launcher shot. Our work reveals that police officers are trained to fire in ways that do not comply with the manufacturer's operating standards, and therefore regularly take the risk of causing injury, or even death.Sources and data analyzed",/en/videos/

Shipwreck off the Greek coast: Tracing the rescue services' failures,Investigation,"Behind bars in the ultra-secure Malakasa camp north of Athens, the 104 survivors of the shipwreck off of Greece's Peloponnese peninsula on the night of June 13 are said to have been ordered not to talk about the circumstances of the disaster. According to several of them, the Greek authorities cited the ""secrecy"" of the procedure, despite the fact that an investigation by the country's Supreme Civil and Criminal Court was ordered the day after the tragedy, which claimed the lives of hundreds of people who had sailed from Libya to reach Italy.For several days, however, questions have been mounting about the slowness of the Greek Coast Guard's intervention and what caused the capsizing of the trawler, whose name remains unknown to this day.Contacted by telephone, Hassan, a Syrian survivor who wished to remain anonymous, recounted a ""journey from hell."" ""When I got on the boat in Libya, I didn't know there would be so many of us. On the deck, where I was, there were around 200 of us. We were on top of each other and, after a few days, we ran out of food and water."" Two men died of thirst during the crossing, according to him.The young man remembers two commercial boats approaching them: ""The first gave us packs of water. We asked the second crew for help, but they left pretty quickly, telling us they couldn't help us, we'd have to wait for the Coast Guard."" The blue trawler aboard which the migrants were sailing was having engine problems. ""At one point, we couldn't go any further and we wanted the Coast Guard − Greek or Italian, it didn't matter − to come and rescue us,"" he said.When the Greek Coast Guard approached the ship, ropes were twice thrown toward their boat to pull them along, according to Hassan and other survivors' accounts leaked to several Greek media outlets. The first time, the rope snapped. The second time, ""the boat rolled from left to right, then sank as a result of their interference,"" insisted Hassan, who swam for almost two hours before being taken to safety on a Greek Coast Guard speedboat. ""I don't know if they wanted to push us back to Italy or take us to Greece, but given their attitude, I didn't get the impression they wanted to save us,"" he said.In one of the accounts published in the center-right Greek daily I Kathimerini, a 23-year-old Syrian echoes Hassan's experience: ""The second time the Coast Guard attached the cable, we initially felt like we were being pulled. Then our boat tilted. The Greek ship picked up speed, and we shouted 'stop' in English (...), but they didn't understand us.""

"How John Williams composes unforgettable soundtracks, from 'Star Wars' to 'Harry Potter'",   ,"Can you hum along to the music from Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park or Harry Potter? Chances are the answer is yes, because these melodies still resonate in our heads today.

He has even become the living artist with the most Oscar nominations − 53 in total.His style has seduced some of Hollywood's most popular directors. Georges Lucas asked him to create the soundtrack for Star Wars, and Steven Spielberg (Indiana Jones, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Catch Me If You Can) entrusted him with the task of scoring all his films, with the exception of The Color Purple.What's the secret sauce behind Williams' popularity? Part of the answer can be found in the great musicians of the 19th century, such as Wagner, Strauss or Debussy. We sum it up with one word: the leitmotif.Sources:",/en/videos/

Faced with the All Blacks, three-time world champions, the pressure is on for Les Bleus. But coach Fabien Galthié's team has a secret weapon that could make all the difference: the kick.The tactic is not one the French team is typically known for. Just six years ago, they used the kick half as much. But Galthié's arrival at the end of 2019 marked a new era for Les Bleus. They gradually integrated the kick into their play – and are returning to success.So why the change? Is kicking now the best strategy to win a rugby match?Watch Le Monde's video explanation below, with the participation of ASM Clermont Auvergne.Sources for this video include:",/en/videos/
Why is France so concerned about the coup in Niger?,"    Since Niger's coup leaders toppled President Mohamed Bazoum on July 26, France has taken a firm stance against the putschists, without getting directly involved in the crisis. ","What's the reason behind France's vocal opposition to Niger's coup leaders? On Wednesday, July 26, President Mohamed Bazoum was overthrown by General Abdourahamane Tchiani, the former head of the presidential guard. Since then, France has actively called for Bazoum to be released and reinstated. And while the country is not intervening directly in the crisis, it supports a possible armed intervention by ECOWAS, the West African regional bloc, against the coup leaders, who take an anti-French position. On August 25, the military rulers gave the French ambassador Sylvain Itté 48 hours to leave the country. Paris rejected the ultimatum, saying that it didn't recognize the junta's authority.Why is France acting in this way, when other countries, such as the United States, have adopted a more flexible line? France is the foreign country with the largest number of soldiers (around 1,500) in Niger, some of whom have left Mali and Burkina Faso in recent years. The country also has certain economic interests in Niger, including uranium mining.We explain the history of France's involvement in Niger and its current political and economic interests in the West African country in this three-minute video.",/en/videos/
US Fed votes to maintain high interest rates,"    The US Federal Reserve kept interest rates at a 22-year high for a second straight meeting, noting that 'economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter.' ","The US Federal Reserve voted on Wednesday, November 1, to hold interest rates at a 22-year high for a second consecutive meeting, as it moves to slow stubborn inflation without damaging the strong economy.The Fed's decision to keep its benchmark lending rate between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent gives policymakers time to ""assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy,"" the central bank said in a statement. The decision was widely expected, given the Fed's stated goal of slowing inflation to its long-term target of two percent.It marks the first time officials have held rates steady at two consecutive meetings since they began tightening monetary policy last year. The US central bank said any future decisions on policy firming would ""take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."" Since peaking at more than seven percent in June last year, inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored yardstick, has slowed by more than half – although it remains stuck firmly above three percent.When the Fed hikes interest rates it raises the cost of borrowing from the bank, which is supposed to dampen economic activity and weaken the labor market. But despite its aggressive monetary tightening, the Fed noted that ""economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter."" Job gains remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low, it added.The Fed's move is likely to raise expectations that it is done hiking interest rates and is moving into a prolonged pause.",/en/economy/
"US sanctions UAE, Turkish, and Chinese entities aiding Russian 'war machine'","    The US Treasury, State and Commerce Department sanctions target hundreds of 'willing third-country individuals and entities' that Russia uses 'to resupply its military'. ","The United States announced sanctions Thursday, November 2, on individuals and companies it accused of abetting Russia's war against Ukraine, targeting entities in Turkey, China and the United Arab Emirates in a bid to disrupt Moscow's supply chains. This comes as Russia has offshored the production of technology, equipment and other goods it needs for its military, relying on suppliers in other countries to acquire these items, said the US Treasury Department.""Russia is dependent on willing third-country individuals and entities to resupply its military and perpetuate its heinous war against Ukraine and we will not hesitate in holding them accountable,"" said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a statement. Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine in February 2022, sparking the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II.The Treasury added on Thursday that Russia has been exploiting ""otherwise legitimate economic relationships"" with other countries. It said entities in China, Turkey and the UAE have been sending Russia dual-use goods such as critical components that Moscow relies on for its weapons systems.The latest sanctions involve 130 new targets. Among them is Turkish national Berk Turken for his role in a procurement network with ties to Russian intelligence services, alongside a UAE-based network for alleged involvement in Russian illicit finance, the department said. The sanctions also take aim at Russia's domestic industrial base, arguing Moscow has reoriented it ""to ensure that the war machine can sustain itself."" Another area is the financial services sector, with sanctions introduced on seven Russia-based banks.Apart from the Treasury, the US State Department is also issuing nearly 100 sanctions targeting areas like Russia's future energy production and revenue, metals and mining sector as well as defense procurement. All property and interests in property of sanctioned parties in the US are blocked and must be reported to US authorities, with restrictions on transactions involving sanctioned people as well.In a separate statement on Thursday, the Commerce Department said it blacklisted 13 entities for supporting Russia's military through the procurement, development and proliferation of Russian drones. Among the entities, 12 are in Russia and one in Uzbekistan. The rule effectively cuts them off from legally accessing items subject to US jurisdiction, said the Commerce Department.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the US for introducing the new sanctions in an evening address. ""This is what is needed,"" he said, calling for every sanction to be implemented in full.",/en/economy/
'Is the US actually flirting with insolvency?',"The size of the US federal debt is more a sign of the robustness of the economy than proof of its weakness, write Paul Simko and Richard Smith, two financial experts.","At a level of over $31 trillion at the end of 2022, there is no doubt that the United States federal debt is very large. For perspective, the US federal debt currently exceeds the combined GDP of China, Japan, Germany, France, and the UK. Is the US actually flirting with insolvency?According to December 2022 Federal Reserve data, the $31.4 trillion securities are held by the US private sector ($15.6 billion), foreign investors ($7.2 billion), the federal government ($6.8 billion) and US state and local governments ($1.6 billion).Just over one-fifth of all US federal debt is owned by the federal government itself. But that debt is an offsetting asset held at the same federal level. Most notably, the Federal Reserve has debt holdings of $5.1 trillion. It uses these securities, as one monetary tool, among others, to influence US and international macro-economic conditions. On a smaller scale, the US Treasury Department is mandated by law to hold US Social Security funds as US Treasuries.A large portion of the US public sector federal spending is financed through the issuance of treasury notes (voluntary) versus taxation (involuntary), alternative methods employed by the federal government of converting private sector capital to public sector capital. This is a federal financing decision, not a federal spending level decision, though the two are often conflated. Due to the immense size and purchasing power of the US domestic private sector, it holds just shy of half the US debt. The main rationale the domestic sector has for holding these in such large quantities is to manage against riskier investments. And from the US federal government perspective, interest payments to the US domestic sector are typically taxable events, and principal repayments keeps cash within its own borders.US state and local governments have similar reasons for owning US federal debt –diversification and risk management, often due to statutory mandates to minimize investment risk of public sector funds. Notably, at the same time the US government is effectively borrowing from state and local governments through US treasuries, it is providing over $1 trillion annually in grants to these same entities.The foreign holdings of $7.4 trillion, just under one-fourth, are those that garner the most attention. Foreign holders, similar to other investors, desire to hold a portion of their assets in low-risk and highly liquid securities. Given that substantial amounts of international trade is in US dollars, and the dollar is the foremost global reserve currency, US debt is also held by foreign investors to satisfy trade, reserve currency, and exchange rate needs. Foreign-owned debt, on average, is much more costly to the US than that domestically held. Interest paid is not recaptured through taxation, and repayments of both interest and principal represent dollars that will leave the US.",/en/economy/
"Anne Krueger: 'Inflation in the US may have peaked, but interventions still have plenty of momentum'",The economist criticizes the impact of US President Joe Biden's protectionist measures on rising prices and US competitiveness.,"It is said that if you put a frog in boiling water, it immediately jumps out; but if you put it in cold water and gradually turn up the heat, it does not react – and is eventually boiled to death. Something similar can happen to economies.Both inflation and the ad hoc interventions – sometimes referred to as industrial policy – distort the economy and result in lower economic growth. But inflation triggers a quick response. An economy-wide phenomenon, it gains momentum as one group after another seeks to restore or increase its real returns.At a certain point, people begin to object. From then on, as the rate of inflation rises, pressure on policymakers to reduce it intensifies. Once inflation is subdued, growth can resume.By contrast, the impact of targeted tariffs and industry-specific measures at any point in time, or in any one sector of the economy, is usually relatively small. Though they contribute inflationary pressure, reduce the economy’s flexibility, and weaken growth, they tend to be less noticed than a surge in inflation, so the public is unlikely to reject them.Moreover, the prospect of lowering a tariff or removing a subsidy is typically met with strong resistance by the affected industry. So, whereas curbing inflation is a political imperative, reversing distortionary ad hoc measures is politically difficult.The United States today illustrates this dynamic. US President Joe Biden’s administration has bemoaned inflationary pressures and supported the US Federal Reserve in its efforts to rein in price increases. But it has also sharply increased government expenditure through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and introduced or upheld widespread industry-specific regulations, most of which are inflationary.Inflation may have peaked in the US, but ad hoc interventions still have plenty of momentum. Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports – which Biden did not remove – have resulted in the world’s highest steel costs. This means that production costs are rising in any industry that relies on large amounts of steel – say, automobile manufacturers. Meanwhile, American producers of electric vehicles are receiving subsidies and tax breaks. Some interventions, such as subsidies, can be dangerous, not least because they can suggest favoritism and even outright corruption.The Biden administration is also imposing tariffs on solar-panel imports, despite its concern for the environment. It has created large subsidies and other incentives for investment in semiconductors and batteries. It has capped the price of some prescription drugs, such as insulin, for elderly Medicare patients, with price ceilings set to be imposed on additional drugs each year, and has introduced a requirement for the government to negotiate prices of some drugs – measures that could lead to shortages and impede the development of cheaper generic drugs.",/en/economy/
United States: The auto strike brings victories for both unionized workers and Southern states,The agreement signed by the three major automakers provides for a 25% pay rise over four years for its workers. It will upset the sector's highly profitable business model on the other side of the Atlantic.,"There's no denying it: Detroit's blue-collar, unionized auto workers are the clear winners of the historic American auto plant strike. Workers at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis will benefit from a wage increase of around 25% over four years, according to the agreements that put an end to the strike. The maximum worker's wage will rise to $42 (€39.50) an hour. An operator will now earn more than $80,000 a year, excluding overtime.The automotive industry is on the verge of returning to its glory days in terms of wages: according to a survey by the Washington Post. With this agreement, the hourly wage, currently $32, will return to the inflation-adjusted level in 1990 – around $42. Back then, auto workers earned 80% more than other private-sector employees.With the bankruptcy of the Detroit automakers in 2009 and the arrival of foreign groups in the non-union South, this gap narrowed to 14% today. It's on the rise again. The embodiment of this success is the progressive Shawn Fain, a former electrician at Chrysler (now part of Stellantis), who was elected head of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union in the spring, and who led a determined strike against the three automakers, the first since the 1930s.The political winner is President Joe Biden, who visited a picket line during the conflict, a first for a US president. The Democrat absolutely needs to win the state of Michigan, where Detroit is located, and which had made Donald Trump's victory in 2016, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.The losers are the Detroit automakers, the Big Three, hit by rising costs as they have to turn the corner on electric vehicles. ""In the past, the UAW always had a realistic respect for the needs of an automobile company to stay competitive. This time, they did not,"" lamented Bob Lutz, former president of Chrysler. Ford put the increase at between $850 and $900 per vehicle. The average selling price of a new vehicle in the USA is $48,000, and there is no model under $20,000.Shareholders are feeling the pinch, even though automaker shares have rebounded slightly with the announcement of the return to work. Wall Street was infatuated with Detroit's revival in January 2021, ready to embark on the battle of the electric vehicle. Since then, Ford's share price has fallen back below $10, from $25 in January 2022. General Motors is at its lowest since 2016, if we exclude the free fall at the start of the Covid-19 crisis, and is worth half what it was a year ago. Ford and General Motors are worth $39 billion and $37 billion respectively, 16 times less than Tesla ($628 billion), whose share price has been halved in two years.",/en/economy/
Jason Furman: 'The US  is making progress on some of its most stubborn problems',"Although all the indicators for the US economy are green, persistently high inflation could cast a shadow over the end of President Joe Biden's term, warns the former chairman of Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.","A year ago Bloomberg predicted with 100% certainty that the United States would go into recession. The US economy defied this prediction, growing at a 4.9% annual rate in the third quarter (or 1.2% actual rate), a phenomenal showing that is nearly triple what is believed to be the economy's underlying potential growth rate. American consumers led the way, increasing their spending at a 4% annual rate. These are the same American consumers that kept the US economy out of recession over the last year and a half – continuing to spend enough to offset any contractionary effects of the Federal Reserve's policies on the housing sector and other parts of the economy.The labor market is very strong as well. The unemployment rate has been at about a 50-year low, jobs are about 2 million higher than pre-pandemic forecasts and labor force participation rates continue to rise. After wages were failing to keep up with inflation for much of 2021 and 2022, they have risen faster than inflation this year and are beginning to catch up with where they otherwise would have been.The biggest pain point in the economy has been inflation but that has gotten better, or at least less bad. The 12-month inflation rate fell from a peak of 9.1% to 3.7% over the last 12 months, the lowest rate among the G7 economies. Moreover, these 12-month data present an outdated view of the pace of inflation – measured over the last three months the underlying pace of inflation is considerably lower.All of this makes it remarkable how negative households are about the economy. The economic approval rating for President Joe Biden is very low and consumer sentiment is around the same level it was in 2009, at a time when the US was in the depths of recession with a 10% unemployment rate. Perhaps consumers are reacting to non-economic news, like immigration or crime. Perhaps they are concerned about the high level of prices or high mortgage rates. But another possibility is that they are not nearly as pessimistic as they claim to be – after all for some reason they keep spending money.If the economy stays good then I would expect people would eventually realize it and approval of the economy would grow. The problem is that although the path to a soft landing has gotten wider it still will be hard to avoid either the Scylla of recession or the Charybdis of continued inflation. Recession risks may not be especially elevated but there is always a chance and history shows that strong recent growth is no guarantee against a rapid deterioration. Events around the world plus the recent tightening of financial conditions in the United States are all at least some cause for concern. No one expects anything like the recent rapid pace of growth to continue.",/en/economy/
"Laurence Nardon: 'In line with Trump, Bidenomics reinforces proud American protectionism'","    The political scientist analyzes the successes and limitations of the Democratic administration's reforms, which, although aimed primarily at the middle class by breaking with neoliberalism, are struggling to win them over politically. ","In the aftermath of the 2007-2008 subprime crisis, public anger at growing social inequality in the United States was reflected both on the right, with the reactionary agitation of the Tea Partiers, and on the left, with the student protests of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Taking office in January 2021, two weeks after an unprecedented assault on Capitol Hill by Donald Trump's supporters, Joe Biden set himself the task of giving the American middle class back the means to climb the social ladder, in order to remove any reason for their populist temptations.His administration embarked on a major shift in economic policy, the key element of which was the return of an interventionist state. As his advisor Jake Sullivan unambiguously announced in an article published in Foreign Policy in February 2020 calling for a move beyond neoliberalism: ""America needs a new economic philosophy.""The new policy combines several major pieces of legislation passed in 2021 and 2022: the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. Added to this are a number of executive actions undertaken since then. Summarized in the White House report ""Bidenomics Is Working,"" published on June 28, Bidenomics first continued the post-Covid-19 economic recovery begun by Trump in the spring of 2020. It then embarked on a vast overhaul of the country's infrastructure, launched an environmental transition centered on the switch to electric cars, and came up with massive support for research and development, prioritizing semiconductor development.In line with Trump, Bidenomics also reinforces proud protectionism, aimed at bringing industrial jobs back to the US and hindering technological competition from China. Other markers of a left-wing economic policy are also there, such as support for trade unions, very visible this fall with the strike by auto industry employees, and the fight against tech giants' monopolies (trials against Google and Amazon began in September).As the presidential campaign for 2024 gets underway, Biden's economic choices and results are being challenged from very different quarters. Leaders on the left of the Democratic Party, for one, are keeping a low profile in their criticism, even though they lament unfinished reforms on student debt reduction and the implementation of a more equalizing tax system. For their part, Trumpist politicians attack the administration from all sides, but in reality, remain in agreement with the principle of a strong, protectionist state.",/en/economy/
"'To finance the energy transition, companies will have to reduce their shareholder remuneration'","France's environmental goals can only be financed by transferring income from the wealthiest individuals to the government, to domestic savings, and to companies who invest in the environmental transition.","Energy transition, water management and biodiversity preservation all require renewable energy production facilities; the thermal renovation of housing and other buildings; industrial and transport decarbonization; more efficient management of water consumption; and arrangements and measures for protecting or preserving a sufficient number of plant and animal species.We know more or less how much additional investment is needed to meet these three objectives. With regard to the energy transition, estimates by Selma Mahfouz and Jean Pisani-Ferry suggest a net additional investment requirement of 2.5% of GDP per year ($2.5 trillion per year worldwide). According to available studies, water-related investments amount to $350 billion a year (or 0.35% of global GDP).The global agreement on biodiversity (Kunming-Montreal agreement, 2022) provided for $200 billion a year in national and international funding, but, according to the Paulson Institute, this should be increased to $800 billion in annual investments (instead of the current $140 billion). Finally, to these sums must be added the public expenditures linked to preserving the purchasing power of the most modest households, which will be severely affected by the rise in energy and water prices.If we devote 0.5% of GDP to this support, investment expenditure linked to the ecological transition should represent around 4% of GDP per year for at least 20 years, divided between public and private investment, by businesses and households alike. How can France finance this?The first possibility is by increasing foreign debt. But France already has a current account deficit of 2% of gross domestic product (GDP). That is to say, it borrows 2% of GDP per year because domestic savings are insufficient to cover its investment needs. This would have to be increased to 6% of GDP to cover all of the additional investment required for this transition. This foreign deficit would be extremely difficult to finance: it could trigger a financial crisis of the kind that hit the southern eurozone countries from 2010 onwards.What's more, every country will be faced with the need to invest in this transition, and will need more investment: this means that there will be a ""war"" for access to funds, and therefore a great deal of competition to attract foreign capital. It's not certain that France is attractive enough to draw in a lot of extra foreign capital in a world where savings have become scarce. It therefore doesn't seem possible to finance additional investments through foreign debt.",/en/economy/
"'In China, the Belt and Road Initiative is adopting a less spectacular but perhaps more sustainable speed'","Beijing will be injecting 10 times less money than in its previous cooperation program, but these investments will be dedicated to less costly and 'greener' projects, observes Le Monde China correspondent in his column.","What do Moscow State Tchaikovsky Music Conservatory, the National Bank of Serbia, the highway network around Dakar, Peru's Chancay port, a high-tech food preservation research center in South Africa, the Mongolian forest, and a future women's world chess tournament have in common? All are soon to receive support from China as part of its ""Belt and Road Initiative"" investment program. These are just seven examples – out of a total of 369 – of the cooperation agreements that China has signed with some 150 countries and 30 international organizations on the occasion of the third Belt and Road Forum (BRF), chaired by China's leader, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on October 17 and 18.While the main highlights of this major event were the red carpet rolled out in honor of Russian president Vladimir Putin and the many out-of-touch speeches made with no reference either to Ukraine or to the Middle East, the key takeaway from the two days was that China is continuing its global investment program – but also revamping it.Of course, Xi did not express the slightest reservation about the past 10 years, but a close look at the agreements signed shows that China has nonetheless listened to some of the international critics. While large-scale projects are not entirely out of fashion, priority will indeed be given to ""small but beautiful"" investments – as the Chinese president called them. From solar power plants in Poland and Romania to the creation of a research center to combat drought and desertification in Saudi Arabia, ""green projects"" are more numerous. At the same time, the fight against corruption is becoming more systematic. Promoting ""integrity-based"" cooperation with evaluations of partner corporations' ""corporate integrity and compliance"" is one of the eight priorities announced by Xi.It's all as if, after a flying start, the Belt and Road Initiative is adopting a less spectacular but perhaps more sustainable cruising speed. In 2013, China erred on the side of optimism and pride, as the new ""emperor"" needed to establish his stature at the center of the world. This achieved, now comes the time for realism – particularly that of a budgetary kind. For the coming years, Xi has announced credit lines of around €100 billion – a substantial amount, but 10 times less than the commitments of the past 10 years (about €1,000 billion).Is it a failure? Yes and no. Who can deny that China now plays a more important role on the international stage than ever before? The Belt and Road Initiative has largely contributed to this. If China is strong, it is often feared rather than loved – even if this is not true everywhere around the globe. ""Africans only have eyes for China,"" said a European diplomat who has had experience in more than 20 African countries. But the closer you get to China geographically, the more frightening it becomes.",/en/economy/
"In search of new markets, France is working to establish itself in Uzbekistan","    Following the French president's November 2 visit, major French groups have made the trip to help exploit the natural resources that Uzbekistan is rich in, as the nation seeks to modernize. ","It was certainly a symbolic moment. On Thursday, November 2, just as French President Emmanuel Macron was visiting Uzbekistan, the Orano mining group announced that it had extracted its first 350 kilograms of uranium in the country. The announcement confirmed the extent to which Macron's tour of Central Asia, which took him to Kazakhstan on November 1 and Uzbekistan the following day, was designed to strengthen France's economic presence in the former Russian heartland, now being courted by Turkey, the European Union and China.Orano, EDF, TotalEnergies and Eiffage used Macron's visit to sign contracts at a business forum in Samarkand (eastern Uzbekistan), the legendary former stopover on the Silk Road in the days of Marco Polo. The event was endorsed by Macron and Ukranian President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, with the good relationship evident in the smiles and pats on the back.""Uzbekistan is transforming, and we must be there,"" insisted Macron at the opening of the forum. France supports Uzbekistan's policy of ""regional peace and stability,"" ""openness and modernization,"" Macron stressed, bringing with him no fewer than 20 French business leaders on his tour of Central Asia, as well as deputy ministers Roland Lescure (industry) and Olivier Becht (foreign trade).In a bid to emerge from the economic isolation it has suffered for the past two decades, Uzbekistan is looking to open up to foreign investment. Already present in Kazakhstan, where it operates the world's largest uranium mine, Orano has been prospecting on the Uzbek side. The contract signed in Samarkand officially launches the extraction phase for the Djengeldi uranium mine in the north of the country. According to Macron's office, this is a ""pilot project"" designed to meet environmental standards. France is seeking above all to secure its uranium supplies, both in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, especially since Niger is no longer a reliable source.The visit was also marked by the signing of contracts in the renewable energies sector. French electricity giant EDF signed an agreement for two hydroelectric projects. TotalEnergies signed a memorandum of understanding for the extension of the Tutly photovoltaic power plant, designed to provide better access to electricity for hundreds of thousands of Uzbek households.A hybrid power plant project – solar, wind, and battery storage – was also signed between Voltalia (a renewable energy player founded by the Mulliez family) and the Uzbek Ministry of Energy. French Treasury funds will also be used for the construction of a drinking water supply system in the Kashkadarya region (south) by the Eiffage group. In addition, the French Veolia and Suez groups, which manage district heating and water purification respectively, will continue to develop their operations.",/en/economy/
Global wine production hits lowest level since 1961,"    Global output decreased by 7% from last year, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine said. ","Global wine production has fallen this year to its lowest level since 1961 as vineyards were pummelled by extreme weather events, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) said Tuesday, November 7. Output reached 244.1 million hectolitres, down 7% from last year, the intergovernmental body said as it presented its first estimates.""Once again, extreme climatic conditions – such as early frost, heavy rainfall, and drought – have significantly impacted the output of the world vineyard,"" said the organization, which provides data to grape and wine-producing and consuming countries.A number of major producers in the southern hemisphere had significant drops in production. Australia, Argentina, Chile, South Africa and Brazil all saw output drop between 10 and 30%.Italy lost the title of top world producer as its output fell 12%, allowing France to reclaim first place as its production held steady. Spain held onto its position as the world's third largest wine producer although its production fell by 14% and was down 19% from its five-year average.The silver lining, if any, for the industry is that it may help alleviate the market imbalance. In ""a context where global consumption is declining and stocks are high in many regions of the world, the expected low production could bring equilibrium to the world market,"" said the OIV.While the OIV speaks of extreme weather events affecting production, they have yet to definitively link it to climate change, said Iñaki Garcia de Cortazar-Atauri at the French national agronomical research institute INRAE. A specialist on the impact of climate change on agriculture, he said that damage in Italy was due to farmed land not being able to absorb water as well as natural soil.But ""one can observe that extreme weather events are becoming more and more frequent,"" he said, with heat waves or rainy periods striking certain regions and adding to existing problems like mildew.",/en/economy/
Climate: 'Blackrock may have found a way to patch things up with Big Oil',"Considered a 'woke' company in Texas, the world's leading financier is not very popular among the state's Big Oil circles. But BlackRock has just signed a major agreement with Occidental Petroleum to invest in a plant for the direct capture and burial of carbon dioxide.","BlackRock has a problem with Texas. In this Republican stronghold, the world's leading financier is seen as a ""woke"" corporation, the ultimate insult. And their ""wokeness"" has grown stronger after the group took a stand in favor of more responsible social and environmental practices.Their commitments have often been contested by environmentalists, but they have established Blackrock's reputation in Houston and Dallas. So it's hardly surprising that the leading oil-producing state in the United States doesn't take this kind of attitude from a company that manages over $9 trillion in assets worldwide.It may have found a way to patch things up with the Big Oil cowboys who pride themselves on their mud-stained boots in the Permian Basin oil fields, America's largest and its biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. BlackRock just signed a major agreement with local star Occidental Petroleum (Oxy). It will invest $500 million in a plant for the direct capture and burial of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It will own 40% of what promises to be, by 2025, the world's largest unit in this field. It alone plans to swallow 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. That's far more than the 36,000 tonnes promised by the world's only industrial facility in this field, located in Iceland.Oil companies see nothing but advantages in this carbon capture technology, either in the air or right out of the plant's chimneys. The activity is close to their core expertise and enables them to continue exploiting their oil rather than having to venture into other, far less lucrative businesses, such as wind or solar power. It could even be a very profitable business for Oxy. Firstly, because it has already sold carbon credits to companies such as Airbus, which are keen to green their balance sheets, but also because this will enable it to... produce more oil. The CO2 buried in the Permian deposits will push the remaining oil out.Environmental organizations are understandably furious and see this as a ploy to resist the energy transition and the associated reduction in hydrocarbon production. This technology, subsidized by the federal government, has yet to prove its effectiveness on an industrial scale, and its cost is currently prohibitive in relation to the emissions reductions it promises.According to the International Energy Agency, the most optimistic scenarios predict that 85 million tonnes of CO2 will be processed in this type of plant in 2030 and 980 in 2050. In other words, peanuts, compared to the 40 billion tonnes of carbon released every year by human activity. It's hardly the revolution that will save black gold from its doomed fate.",/en/economy/
Polish truckers block Ukraine border crossings as tensions grow over imports,"    Polish truckers' organizations have blocked three border crossings between the two countries, denouncing 'unfair competition' from their Ukrainian counterparts. ","""Polish farmers are afraid of cheap Ukrainian wheat, we're afraid of Ukrainian truckers. We're being swamped by their trucks."" Jacek Sokol is the owner of a road transport company and one of the leading protesters at the Ukrainian border. He summed up the mood of the country's truckers with these words to the Polish media. Since Monday, November 6, several industry organizations have been blocking the Dorohusk, Hrebenne and Korczowa border crossings in south-eastern Poland. Almost all road traffic has been paralyzed. One truck per hour is allowed through, with the exception of humanitarian convoys and aid to the Ukrainian army. Their strike action could last several weeks.The demonstrators, who blame the fall in their income on the liberalization of border transport rules for Ukraine by the European Union (EU) since the start of the invasion in February 2022, are demanding that the regulations in force before the outbreak of war be reinstated. At that time, Ukrainian trucks could only enter Poland with a special permit. ""Certain solutions are being introduced without consulting us. We're being presented with a fait accompli, and we don't understand what's going on,"" said Sokol.Polish drivers have also denounced the lack of control over Ukrainian trucks, which, in theory, have no authorization to transport goods between EU countries. ""In practice, most trucks arrive empty, pick up loads in Poland and take them all over Europe. They simply take our work away from us,"" said Bartosz Jasinski, owner of a trucking company. According to industry organizations, nearly 900,000 Ukrainian trucks entered Poland this year, compared with 180,000 per year before the war.Truckers feel discriminated against and are demanding checks on the Ukrainian electronic queuing system for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) at the border. Polish drivers traveling to Ukraine are forced to wait up to two weeks empty before returning to Poland. For Warsaw, which has the largest HGV fleet in the EU, accounting for almost 25% of trucks on the road, this is a key issue. In 2022, the road and logistics sector was worth 375 billion zlotys (€84 billion), or 7% of the country's gross domestic product and 6.5% of jobs.The Ukrainian government said on Tuesday that it had yet to receive an ""official request"" from Polish truckers. ""If there is an official and reasoned position from our Polish partners, we are open to constructive dialogue,"" the infrastructure ministry said in a statement, saying it was ""in constant communication"" with Polish and European authorities to ""resolve"" this crisis and ""unblock the checkpoints as soon as possible."" ""The blocking of the border is detrimental to the interests of both countries,"" said the Ukrainian ministry. The previous day, its Polish counterpart had called on the demonstrators to cease their action.",/en/economy/
Yevgeny Prigozhin: Verified images of plane crash with Wagner boss on passenger list,   ,"Yevgeny Prigozhin was on the passenger list of a plane that crashed northwest of Moscow on Wednesday, August 23, according to Russia's aviation authority.

Will El Niño make climate change worse?,   ,"The return of the El Niño weather phenomenon was confirmed in July 2023. Meanwhile, the planet has been suffering the consequences of climate change for most of this year, with fires, heatwaves, and droughts seen across the globe. Faced with this double threat of the warming band of ocean water caused by El Niño, and a warming globe caused by human emissions,  should we expect the worst?El Niño, a climatic anomaly that increases the temperature of the Pacific Ocean, generally recurs every two to seven years. Episodes usually last nine to twelve months. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the last El Niño episode was observed in 2015-16, so seven years ago.In 2018-2019, a weak El Niño gave way to a particularly long, nearly three-year episode of La Niña, its ""sister"" event which causes the opposite effects, including cooling ocean surface temperatures. Yet the planet experienced record temperatures during these years.So what can we expect from a new El Niño? Will it accelerate global warming? Does global warming have an impact on the strength of this climatic anomaly?SOURCES :",/en/videos/
India becomes first nation to land a spacecraft near the Moon's south pole,    Prime Minister Narendra Modi waved an Indian flag on a live broadcast from the BRICS group summit in South Africa to announce the mission's success. ,"India on Wednesday, August 23, landed a spacecraft near the moon's south pole, an uncharted territory that scientists believe could hold vital reserves of frozen water and precious elements.A lander with a rover inside touched down on the lunar surface at 6:04 local time, sparking cheers and applause among the space scientists watching in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru. After a failed attempt nearly four years ago, India made history by becoming the first country to touch down near the little-explored south pole region and joined the United States, the Soviet Union and China in achieving a moon landing.Prime Minister Narendra Modi smiled broadly and waved an Indian flag on a live broadcast to announce the mission's success as a triumph that extended beyond his country's borders. ""On this joyous occasion I would like to address the people of the world,"" said Modi from the sidelines of the BRICS diplomatic summit in South Africa. ""India's successful moon mission is not just India's alone,"" he added. ""This success belongs to all of humanity.""India's successful landing comes just days after Russia's Luna-25, which was aiming for the same lunar region, spun into an uncontrolled orbit and crashed. It would have been the first successful Russian lunar landing after a gap of 47 years. Russia's head of the state-controlled space corporation Roscosmos attributed the failure to the lack of expertise due to the long break in lunar research that followed the last Soviet mission to the moon in 1976.People across India, home to the world's largest population, crowded around televisions in offices, shops, restaurants and homes. Thousands prayed Tuesday for the success of the mission with oil lamps on the river banks, temples and religious places, including the holy city of Varanasi in northern India.India's Chandrayaan-3 – ""moon craft"" in Sanskrit – took off from a launchpad in Sriharikota in southern India on July 14. ""India's pursuit of space exploration reaches a remarkable milestone with the impending Chandrayaan-3 Mission, poised to achieve a soft landing on the lunar surface. This achievement marks a significant step forward for Indian Science, Engineering, Technology, and Industry, symbolizing our nation's progress in space exploration,"" the Indian Space Research Organization said in a statement earlier on Wednesday.They said a successful Chandrayaan-3 landing would be monumental in fueling curiosity and sparking a passion for exploration among youth. ""It generates a profound sense of pride and unity as we collectively celebrate the prowess of Indian science and technology. It will contribute to fostering an environment of scientific inquiry and innovation,"" the organization said.The six-wheeled lander and rover module of Chandrayaan-3 is configured with payloads that would provide data to the scientific community on the properties of lunar soil and rocks, including chemical and elemental compositions.India's previous attempt to land a robotic spacecraft near the moon's south pole ended in failure in 2019. It entered the lunar orbit but lost touch with its lander, which crashed while making its final descent to deploy a rover to search for signs of water. According to a failure analysis report submitted to the ISRO, the crash was caused by a software glitch. The $140-million mission in 2019 was intended to study permanently shadowed moon craters that are thought to contain water deposits and were confirmed by India's Chandrayaan-1 orbiter mission in 2008.",/en/science/
Indian spacecraft lands near the Moon's south pole in world first,"    India has joined the elite club of countries to have landed a spacecraft on the Moon, after the US, the USSR and China. Chandrayaan-3 landed successfully, four days after the failure of a Russian mission. ","At 14:34 Central European Summer Time, India joined the exclusive club of countries that have landed a spacecraft on the Moon, after the United States, the USSR and China. For around 20 minutes on Wednesday, August 23, the country remained riveted to its screens. All eyes were on Chandrayaan-3, whose Vikram lander began its crucial descent toward the Moon. The spacecraft, which gradually slowed, finally landed gently near the south pole, an as yet unexplored region. A world first, and yet another milestone in the history of India's space program.This was the second attempt. In 2019, a first Indian mission failed after the craft entered orbit around the Moon, but lost contact with the team on Earth.Cheers and applause rang out in Bangalore on Wednesday from the control center of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). More than 7 million people also followed the moon landing live on ISRO's YouTube channel. ""India’s successful moon mission is not just India’s alone,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Johannesburg, where he was attending the BRICS summit (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). ""This success belongs to all of humanity,"" he declared, adding ""It will help moon missions by other countries in the future.""Since the departure of Chandrayaan-3 – Sanskrit for ""lunar ship"" – on July 14 from the launch pad in Sriharikota, in the south of the country, enthusiasm has been running high, reaching a crescendo. On Wednesday, thousands of people across India prayed for the mission's success, and schools across the country organized special ceremonies.The Indian space mission, which cost only $75 million (€69 million) – less than the budget of the film Gravity, estimated at $100 million – has succeeded where Russia failed four days earlier. Luna-25 crashed on August 19, two days before its scheduled lunar landing in the same region, following an uncontrolled shift in orbit. The failure was attributed to a loss of expertise on the part of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, due to the long hiatus in lunar research following the last Soviet mission to the Moon in 1976, and the Kremlin's lack of interest in this field.ISRO, founded in 1969 with a relatively modest budget, excels in frugal space engineering. It has helped strengthen the country's weather forecasting and telecommunications capabilities. The private space sector is booming. ""This is the genius of Indian engineers,"" said Mathieu Weiss, space advisor and representative in India of the French National Center for Space Studies (CNES). ""On Wednesday, they paved the way for low-cost, cheaper and simpler exploration, and we can learn from their approach.""",/en/science/
Women are more vulnerable to heat wave related mortality than men,"    A number of studies have attempted to shed light on the causes of women's excess mortality during hot weather, and suggest various explanations, both physiological and social. ","In many countries, particularly Europe, more women than men die during heat waves. Some researchers have attempted to explain this discrepancy due not only to the fact that women live longer but also to physiological and behavioral factors. During the 2003 heat wave in France, the number of heat-related deaths among people over the age of 55 was 15% higher among women than men of the same age, according to a study published by several researchers at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in 2006.France is far from being an exception. A number of studies have been conducted in the Netherlands, for example, showing significant gender differences in heatwave deaths. In one of the most comprehensive studies on the subject, published in 2021, researchers from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam identified several possible causes. Among them are differences in sweating, cardiovascular tension, the ratio of body surface area to mass, and the greater propensity of women to live alone or be active in the home. As women live longer – up to 81 in Europe, compared with 75 for men – and are therefore over-represented among the elderly vulnerable to heat, the researchers adjusted their results to avoid overestimating female mortality.The researchers' first explanation is that women sweat less and lose less heat. ""Sweating is a particularly effective method of cooling, and in this sense, women, who have a lower capacity to perspire and evaporate sweat, are at a disadvantage,"" said Hein Daanen, a physiology researcher at the Free University of Amsterdam and co-author of the 2021 study. ""When the air temperature exceeds the body temperature [on average between 36°C and 37°C], the only way for the body to lose heat is by sweating,"" said Mike Tipton, a researcher at the University of Portsmouth and author of several studies on the subject.But that's not all – as they regulate their body temperature more by increasing blood transfers to the skin, women are more likely to develop cardiovascular problems in hot weather. ""When it's very hot, there's a sort of detour effect, as blood, which flows more to the skin, can't go as far to other parts of the body, such as, for example, the heart. As the heart receives less blood, it compensates by beating faster, which raises cardiovascular pressure – already higher in women than men – and increases the associated risks, such as stroke,"" Daanen said.Another hypothesis put forward by the researchers is that differences in height and weight affect the ability to spread heat throughout the body. ""If we establish the 'body surface area/mass ratio, it is more important in women, even if this may seem counter-intuitive. A man can have a body surface area of 2 square meters and a weight of 100 kg, giving a ratio of 2/100, compared with 1.5 square meters and 50 kg for a woman, giving a ratio of 1.5/50. As the ratio is higher for women, they have a greater propensity to absorb heat, albeit with less mass to radiate it,"" Tipton said.",/en/science/
The tide guarded its secrets for centuries,Series,"The weather forecast was far from great that morning on the Normandy coast. But the tide was set to be low at dawn, and the last light of the full moon would make it possible to make out the obstacles and mines scattered along the shore by the German army. Then the tide would rise, helping the troops to gain a foothold. American strategists and their allies therefore decided on June 6, 1944, as the date for kicking off the D-Day landings at Arromanches-les-Bains (code name Gold Beach) and surrounding beaches. The ebb and flow of the English Channel went down in history that day, but unlike cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes and great ocean currents, tides don't get their own name.Timings and amplitudes of the ebb and flow in coastal waters: For thousands of years, soldiers, fishermen, pirates and sailors of all stripes have known the value of this essential information. Long before the advent of computers and satellites, they tried to predict the occurrence and intensity of such events by observing this natural phenomenon, rather than understanding it. As Pierre Simon, Marquis de Laplace – an exceptional astronomer, mathematician and physicist – put it at the turn of the 18th century, this was ""the most thorny problem of all celestial mechanics.""The principle of the tides could be summarily presented as a sort of subtle clockwork system that drives a colossal electric beater spinning on itself. Tides are the result of multiple waves propagating across the oceans at different speeds, losing energy as they come into contact with the continental shelves. Once there, their behavior is highly variable: turbulent or languid, depending on the topography of the coastline. Occasionally, they rush into the mouths of rivers, where they create tidal bores – in other words, counter-currents. The North Atlantic offers two spectacular illustrations of the force of liquid masses in motion. At the entrance to the English Channel, the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel experiences extraordinary tidal ranges (or amplitudes), reaching 15 meters high during high tide periods, which see the sea retreat up to 15 kilometers over this shallow seabed. In eastern Canada, water heights vary by up to a record 17 meters in front of the Bay of Fundy's tortuous coastline.It's hard to understand these phenomena viewed from a beach or a cliff. Frustrated, astronomers and other thinkers eager for discovery turned their backs on the tides for centuries. ""Tides long remained an unsolved 'old subject',"" wrote David Edgar Cartwright in his 1999 scientific history of the tides Tides. A Scientific History, featuring a portrait of Isaac Newton on the cover. The Newton tribute is well-deserved, since the scientist's revelations at the end of the 17th century about the law of universal gravitation governing the mutual attraction of the sun, moon and Earth, led to a fundamental leap forward in our understanding of the principle of high and low tides.",/en/science/
Pharaoh Amenhotep II gave his wet nurse the royal treatment,"    Upon her death around 3,450 years ago, the woman received embalming usually reserved for the elite. This secret was revealed by the analysis of the residue of two canopic jars used to store her viscera found in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings. ","Back in the time of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, on the banks of the Nile, lived Senetnay. She was to become ""she who fed the flesh of the god"": nursemaid to a baby who would later ascend the Egyptian throne as Amenhotep II. The pharaoh must have been truly grateful, for Senetnay was treated with the utmost care after her death. Not only was she buried in the Valley of the Kings, but, as revealed by an international study published on Thursday, August 31, in Scientific Reports, the remains of the royal wet nurse were embalmed to a high standard.However, the remains in question no longer exist. The authors of this multi-disciplinary study, which combines archaeology, chemistry and botany, only examined two of the four canopic jars in which Senetnay's viscera (liver, lungs, stomach, intestines) were stored by the embalmers during the mummification of her body. These limestone jars were removed in 1900 from ""Tomb Kings Valley 42"" in the Valley of the Kings by the British explorer Howard Carter, who 22 years later was to discover the amazing untouched tomb of Tutankhamun. Kept in the August-Kestner museum in Hanover, Germany, the two jars analyzed by the researchers contained Senetnay's lungs and liver. A third jar can be found at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and the fourth has disappeared from circulation.How did the scientists go about this? ""The first step,"" explained Thibaut Devièse, senior lecturer at Aix-Marseille University and co-author of the study, ""was to use a scalpel to remove residue from the surface of the items."" Six samples were taken from the bottom and sides of the jars. The researchers then used solvents to extract various chemical compounds from the Egyptian balsams, which then had to be identified using several techniques.The difficulty lies in the fact that, while some molecules can be preserved over millennia, others are altered and only the product of this degradation is found. ""We need to successfully reconnect the molecules identified to the original materials,"" explained Thibaut Devièse. It is like tracing the family tree of these molecules. This research involved a great deal of work upstream. ""Natural reference substances are artificially aged in the laboratory, for example by heating them or placing them under UV lamps,"" added the chemist. ""This enables us to see the reaction patterns and tells us that a specific molecule is the result of another's degradation.""As a result, the ingredients used by the embalmer to preserve Senetnay's organs are some of the richest of all those known for this period. A mixture of animal fats and vegetable oils, bitumen, beeswax, substances from conifers, aromatic plants and a final component, which is either pistachio resin or dammar, a resin from trees found only in Southeast Asia. In both cases, there are imported products, like bitumen and conifers. The researchers were also surprised to find larixol, a molecule suggesting the presence of larch resin, a tree now found only in the Alps and Eastern Europe.",/en/science/
Whales were not nearly as numerous three centuries ago as believed,"    By calculating genome mutations between generations, a team of researchers has revised downward the North Atlantic cetacean population prior to industrial fishing. ","Professor of marine biology at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, Per Palsboll is careful to put things into perspective: ""We're just scientists. When making a decision on whaling, there are many criteria to take into account, and our results are just one element."" Nonetheless, the article his team published in Science on Friday, September 1, is certain to make waves during the forthcoming discussions between states on the course of action to take. It concluded that the humpback whale population in the North Atlantic before the era of industrial fishing – three centuries ago – was much smaller than previously thought: just over 20,000 individuals, a far cry from the 150,000 envisaged. This means that the current population, estimated at 12,000 humpback whales, is much healthier than previously thought. Norway, the only European country to continue fishing for cetaceans, should welcome the news.As spectacular as it is, this result is only one consequence of the study presented in Science. The aim of the researchers from nine different countries, coordinated by the University of Groningen and the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown (Maine, US), was in fact to determine what geneticists call the mutation rate of baleen whales, in other words the probability of a mutation occurring in the genome of an individual between two generations. These mutations are essential: When they are favorable, they enable a species to adapt to changes in its environment; when they are harmful, they lead to the development of pathologies.Until now, scientists have used two methods to calculate this value. The first involved multiplying the sequencing of individuals to determine the genetic diversity of the population, then estimating the date of appearance of this species in the tree of life and the time spent between two generations, and deducing the famous rate. The problem is that these last two values are very difficult to assess accurately. The second method consists in comparing the DNA of current individuals with that of ancient specimens. However, fossils of sufficiently high quality must be available.The new technique is quite different. Much simpler in principle, it simply compares the DNA of mother/father/child trios. It has already been used extensively with groups of animals bred in captivity. But this lifestyle in itself modifies all the parameters. In the wild, wolves, blue tits, seals and platypuses have benefited from this ""pedigree"" method. Palsboll's team used it for the first time on four whale species: blue, humpback, bowhead and fin whales. ""The difficulty lies in having these trios available,"" said Marcos Suarez Menendez, first author of the publication, ""and while females often stay with their calves, the males can be very far away.""",/en/science/
'The sale of Rafales to Saudi Arabia would be a success by default for French aircraft in the ruthless arms business',Saudi Arabia is considering purchasing 54 aircraft from Dassault Aviation after a German veto blocked its purchase of 48 Typhoon jets due to human rights concerns.,"Saudi Arabia's purchase of French fighter jets would be a major economic coup for Dassault Aviation and a political coup for France. The Saudis are considering purchasing 54 Rafales and asking the aircraft manufacturer to make an offer by November 10, revealed La Tribune Dimanche on October 22. Talks have been confirmed by Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu, with no further details.There's a ""Rafale moment,"" as Eric Trappier, the manufacturer's CEO, declared at the end of August. The first exports of the plane were not until the Egyptian order of 2015. Trappier is convinced that the multirole aircraft (roles include air defense, reconnaissance, nuclear deterrence and anti-ship combat) is an alternative to American and Russian aircraft. So much so that he is giving ""priority"" to the fifth-generation Rafale, scheduled for 2030, relegating to second place the air combat system of the future being developed with Airbus Defense and Space of Germany and Indra of Spain.A sale to Riyadh would first and foremost be a commercial success. Not as important as the 80 aircraft acquired by the United Arab Emirates, but on the same scale as the orders from Egypt and India. The latter is currently finalizing the purchase of 26 additional aircraft. Rich in petrodollars and with a defense budget of $70 billion (€66 billion) in 2022, up for the first time since 2018, Saudi Arabia is the world's fifth-largest arms buyer.The operation would also reinforce the strategic choice made by General Charles de Gaulle at the start of the Fifth Republic: a complete army model based on an industry capable of supplying almost all its equipment. As manufacturers cannot survive on national orders alone, this implies major exports of military equipment. The Rafale fulfills this role, with 261 of its 453 orders delivered to other countries.Finally, it would be a political success for Paris against the United States, and above all against Europe. The Saudi Air Force is equipped with Boeing F-15s, European Eurofighter Typhoons and British Tornados. It will probably fall back on the Rafale if the German veto prevents it from buying the 48 Typhoons. Under pressure from the Greens, who accuse Riyadh of war crimes in Yemen, Chancellor Olaf Scholz had to oppose the sale.

"India launches spacecraft to study Sun, days after successful Moon landing","    The Aditya-L1 spacecraft took off on board a satellite launcher from the Sriharikota space center in southern India. It will head to the L1 point of the Earth-Sun system, which offers an uninterrupted view of the Sun. ","India launched its first space mission to study the Sun on Saturday, September 2, less than two weeks after a successful uncrewed landing near the south-polar region of the Moon. The Aditya-L1 spacecraft took off on board a satellite launch vehicle from the Sriharikota space center in southern India on a quest to study the Sun from a point about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from Earth. The spacecraft is equipped with seven payloads to study the Sun's corona, chromosphere, photosphere and solar wind, the Indian Space Research Organization said.After over an hour, the ISRO said the launch was accomplished successfully. ""The vehicle has placed the satellite precisely into its intended orbit. India’s first solar observatory has begun its journey to the destination of Sun-Earth L1 point,"" ISRO posted on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter.India became the first country to land a spacecraft near the Moon's south pole on August 23 — a historic voyage to uncharted territory that scientists believe could hold vital reserves of frozen water. After a failed attempt to land on the Moon in 2019, India joined the United States, the Soviet Union and China as only the fourth country to achieve this milestone. The Sun study, combined with India's successful Moon landing, would completely change the image of ISRO in the world community, said Manish Purohit, a former ISRO scientist.The Aditya-L1 was headed for the L1 point of the Earth-Sun system, which affords an uninterrupted view of the Sun, ISRO said. ""This will provide a greater advantage of observing solar activities and their effect on space weather in real-time."" The satellite is scheduled to take 125 days to reach the L1 point.Once in place, the satellite would provide reliable forewarning of an onslaught of particles and radiation from heightened solar activity that has the potential to knock out power grids on Earth, said B.R. Guruprasad, a space scientist, in an article in The Times of India newspaper. The advanced warning can protect the satellites that are the backbone of global economic structure as well as the people living in space stations.""Those seven payloads are going to study the Sun as a star in all the possible spectrum positions that we have visible, ultraviolet, and X-ray (...) It's like we're going to get a black and white image, the color image and the high-definition image, 4K image of the Sun, so that we don't miss out on anything that is happening on the Sun,"" Purohit said.",/en/science/
The third sex of the African dwarf mouse,"    Three-quarters of the females in this rodent species have a Y sex chromosome. Although they display male behavior, they are nonetheless fertile. ","The African dwarf mouse (Mus minutoides) may be one of the world's smallest rodents, but it has invented nothing less than a third sex. This quirk of nature was discovered by a French specialist in evolutionary genetics. ""I set up the world's only breeding facility for this species, after capturing specimens in South Africa,"" said Frédéric Veyrunes of the CNRS (University of Montpellier). In 2009, he was astonished to discover that at least three-quarters of this rodent's females, instead of carrying two X sex chromosomes – like almost all placental mammal females – have one X and one Y chromosome, which is normally the prerogative of males. Fewer than a quarter of this dwarf mouse's females, however, are classically XX.Female mice with a Y chromosome? Well, yes. Provided, however, that a mutation has struck a gene (we don't know which) on their X chromosome. This mutated X, or X*, distinguishes them from males, who are classically XY. According to one possible scenario, ""the mutated X* gene could produce a protein that inhibits the action of the SRY protein, which normally triggers the differentiation of the embryo's sexual organs towards the male pathway,"" said Veyrunes.What's even more astonishing is that the X*Y females of this graceful rodent are perfectly fertile, while the very rare XY females that are sometimes born in other mammal species, including our own, are always sterile. Better still, the X*Y females of this mouse are even more fertile than XX females. ""Their better ovulation rate compensates for the fact that a quarter of their embryos, the YYs, are non-viable. In the end, their reproductive success is better,"" said the geneticist.Another surprise is that this third sex has acquired male behaviors. X*Y females are thus more aggressive than XXs, have a bite strength equivalent to that of males, travel longer distances to explore their environment and also deliver better parental care than XXs. In short, they are super-females with male characteristics.""If the Y chromosome has passed to both males and females, it may eventually no longer be essential in this species,"" said Veyrunes, who is keen to study another dwarf mouse, Mus triton, in which males now have only one sex chromosome, the X, and females too, an X*. ""The loss of the Y would be the next evolutionary step, in Mus minutoides.""",/en/science/
Superconductors: US study suspected of fraud,"    In March, a team from the University of Rochester published a paper in 'Nature' on an alloy with promising properties. Since then, doubts have been growing about the reliability of the data and the integrity of its main co-author. ","The year 2023 will go down as a milestone in the history of superconductivity, as a material made in the US has been whipping up a storm after earlier claims of breakthroughs by South Korean researchers. Few people, however, believe in the reliability of the result. Suspicions of dishonesty have even been cast against its principal co-author, Ranga Dias, a professor at the University of Rochester (New York State), who has already had two science papers withdrawn from the scientific literature because of doubts about the data he provided. He has also been accused of plagiarism in his thesis.On March 8, the US team made a splash in the journal Nature. It said it had manufactured a material that becomes superconducting as soon as the temperature drops below just 21°C high pressure – 10,000 times the pressure exerted by the atmosphere. Still, this remains 200 times lower than the previous record.Questions about the results' quality immediately arose, and several teams tried to replicate the experiment without success. The latest one, from China, posted its negative findings on July 1 on the prepublication site Arxiv.org, explaining that while the material's resistance dropped, it remained non-zero. Only one other US team was able to test a Rochester sample and achieve electrical measurements compatible with those published. ""We can't say it's a replication because the sample is very dirty and inhomogeneous. Magnetic measurements are also missing,"" pointed out Hai-Hu Wen, the co-author of one of the negative studies at Nanjing University (China). ""That's in progress,"" said Russell Hemley, a professor at the University of Illinois responsible for these experiments and Dias' former co-author.An accumulation of facts further undermined confidence in Rochester's result. The latest: On September 1, the journal Nature published a warning on the page of the March 8 paper stating that ""the reliability of data presented in this manuscript is currently in question. Appropriate editorial action will be taken once this matter is resolved.""On August 15, the same kind of warning led to the retraction of an earlier paper signed by Dias and published in Physical Review Letters in 2021. The journal had enlisted the help of four experts, as revealed by US journalist Daniel Garisto in Nature back on July 25. Their reports, which Le Monde was able to consult, are devastating. In it, they explained that the data supposedly provided from experiments are not represented in the graphs that were published! Worse still, they confirmed that these graphs were partly decals of graphs previously published for a different material and under different pressures.",/en/science/
What exactly is superconductivity?,"    This physical property of a material, which translates into the absence of resistance to the passage of current, has many applications, such as medical MRI. It also raises hopes for research into nuclear fusion and quantum computing. ","In an electric cable, the current is carried by electrons whose movement is disturbed by the atoms of the metal (such as copper) and the charges of neighboring electrons. This resistance heats up the material, reducing its efficiency. By lowering the temperature significantly, the metal can undergo a transition and become superconducting, i.e. no longer resisting the current. In a loop circuit, electrons rotate ad infinitum.The first demonstration of this effect, in 1911, with solid mercury cooled to -268.95°C by liquid helium, earned Dutchman Heike Kamerlingh Onnes the 1913 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1987, Germany's Johannes Georg Bednorz and Switzerland's Karl Alexander Müller were awarded the same Nobel Prize, 16 months after their discovery of a copper-based ceramic that superconducts at -238°C. Others followed, reaching a record of -138°C, paving the way for numerous applications.For example, medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires powerful magnetic fields to rotate atoms. Created by coils, these fields require a powerful current and therefore generate high temperatures. With helium-cooled superconducting cables, these constraints disappear. Even manufacturers of high-voltage cables have been deploying these technologies in recent years, not only to reduce losses but also to limit the size or number of copper cables required.In 2022, Nexans announced such an installation at Montparnasse train station in Paris, following a demonstration in Germany in 2014 over one kilometer. The cable is cooled with liquid nitrogen to around -195°C. On the same energy front, most nuclear fusion projects require magnetic fields to trap fuel, the intensity of which is such that only superconducting cables can generate them.Another property of these materials is the stuff of dreams. They have the ability to expel surrounding magnetic fields, making it possible to dream of trains levitating above magnetized rails. Japanese trains already run in this way, but using a more energy-intensive process.Finally, on a completely different scale, superconductors are among the candidates for the realization of a quantum computer, a calculating machine promising to solve previously unsolvable operations. A miniature component made from a sandwich of an insulator and two superconducting layers behaves like an artificial atom with two states. These ""qubits,"" which are both 0 and 1, to use computer science jargon, are the key to more efficient calculations.",/en/science/
'Made in France' products hit hard by inflation,"    Households facing budget restraints are now opting for cheaper products that may be imported. In response to this, French brands are trying to fight back. ","For France Cauchy, manager of the La Bel'France boutique in Cluny (eastern France), which exclusively sells French products, the summer of 2023 failed to live up to its promises. ""Footfall, sales and average order value are down by around 20%,"" said the shopkeeper. ""Nothing is selling as well. Even the €5 or €6 soaps didn't do as well this year!""This can be attributed to both the weather and French vacationers choosing to travel abroad rather than stay within France... but that's not the only reason. This pretty Burgundy town is not the only place experiencing disenchantment with ""Made in France"" products. As is the case with organic products, sales of which fell by 13% in the first half of the year, products made in France are also feeling the impact of inflation. Households facing budget restraints are now opting for cheaper products that may be imported.""The price signal is extremely strong, and that affects all walks of life. Not everyone can afford to buy pants at €120 or a T-shirt at €45,"" said Christèle Merter, president of La Gentle Factory, a French clothing brand (despite its name) that she created in 2013.""We saw consumer spending fall over several stages,"" said Merter. ""The first jolts were felt in June 2022. Things went from bad to worse, and September [2023] was really bad."" The brand then launched a promotion to mark its tenth anniversary. ""All our items were discounted by 50% on our website. Within 10 hours, we made 10% of our annual turnover,"" boasted the company director. Proof that consumers aren't turning their back on French goods per se, but rather the prices attached to them.""Since spring, 'made in France' brands have seen a drop in sales of up to 30%, sometimes more,"" said Olivier Ducatillon, president of the Union of Textile Industries. ""It's a real problem. When the economy becomes the main focus, where products come from is no longer top priority."" While textiles and footwear aren't doing too well, French home furnishings aren't faring much better, with sales down by as much as 40%, according to Charles Huet, president of La carte française, a gift card distributed by works councils, allowing people to treat themselves to French products.Fabienne Delahaye, president of MIF Expo, the ""made in France"" trade show taking place in Paris from November 9 to 12, assures us however that ""there is still an appetite. People are aware of what's at stake. It's a given."" However, companies representing some 100,000 jobs in France are suffering. To maintain their presence at the show, ""some exhibitors have told me that they are going to be making savings elsewhere, for example by canceling communication campaigns,"" confided Delahaye.",/en/economy/
UK rejoins EU science program it left due to Brexit,"    The United Kingdom has rejoined the science research scheme Horizon Europe after reaching a 'bespoke' deal, opening the door to UK researchers being able to apply for EU research grants. ","Britain is to rejoin the Horizon Europe science research programme under a new bespoke deal, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's office and the EU said on Thursday.""As part of the new deal negotiated over the last six months, the prime minister has secured improved financial terms of association to Horizon Europe that are right for the UK,"" a statement said.Horizon is a European Union scheme that funds research projects which the UK says it has been excluded from for the past three years, following Brexit. The deal follows a call between Sunak and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday.""The EU and UK are key strategic partners and allies, and today's agreement proves that point. We will continue to be at the forefront of global science and research,"" von der Leyen said in a statement.The deal means that UK researchers can apply immediately for grants and bid to take part in projects under the Horizon programme, the UK government statement said. ""Horizon will give UK companies and research institutions unrivalled opportunities to lead global work to develop new technologies and research projects, in areas from health to AI,"" it added.Britain previously said it had been excluded from the EU's flagship Horizon Europe programme that funds research, nuclear regulator Euratom and the Copernicus satellite monitoring group. London said it considered the delay to be a breach of the post-Brexit deal. Just over a year ago, it launched dispute procedures with the EU over the exclusion, using a mechanism set out in a post-Brexit deal.The British government said that its inability to participate in science and technology programmes was causing ""serious damage"" both in the UK and EU countries. The EU responded by saying there were ""serious difficulties"" since the post-Brexit trading accord did not oblige the EU to make the UK an associate on such programmes.",/en/science/
French study reopens the debate on the impact of screen time for kids,    An analysis of a large sample of children suggests that the context of use and family factors play a more important role than screen time. Several specialists say this finding should be treated with caution. ,"To what extent does exposing young children to screens impair their development? In a new study in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry on August 29, a French team is reviving this burning debate.In fact, the results of the study led its authors to relativize the negative impact of exposure times to television, computers, games consoles, tablets and smartphones on the brains of children aged 2, 3 and a half, and 5 and a half. They even describe the deleterious effect of these screens as ""modest,"" once the child's family environment and lifestyle are taken into account. But as soon as these results were published, experts were divided over their interpretation, with some warning of the dangers of downplaying the detrimental effects of screens, which are far from harmless.""The context in which screens are used plays an important role, probably more so than the amount of time spent in front of them,"" said Jonathan Bernard of the Center for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics (National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM); National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment; and Paris Cité and Sorbonne-Paris-Nord universities), who led the study.The authors analyzed data from nearly 14,000 children monitored as part of the French ELFE cohort (French Longitudinal Study From Infancy Onward). This is the first cohort in metropolitan France dedicated to the regular tracking of children born in 2011, from birth to adulthood.The researchers assessed the toddlers' language development at age 2, their non-verbal reasoning at age 3.5 and their overall cognitive development at ages 3.5 and 5.5. They also measured the influence on this development of many other factors linked to the family's socio-economic status (parents' level of education, working hours, income, presence of siblings, etc.); the child itself (gender, whether born prematurely or not); and daily activities (childcare arrangements, frequency of activities shared with parents, sleep time, time spent outdoors, screen-free play, etc.).The team confirmed that the amount of time children are exposed to screens is detrimental to their brain development. But they added a nuance to this finding: This relationship appeared to be much weaker when the family environment is properly taken into account. According to the authors' observations, the impact of screens on cognitive development drops by 40% to 80% once the influence of family factors is considered, and by a further 10% to 20% once the child's other activities are also factored in. A child who reads a lot, for example, will have better cognitive development than one who reads little, all other things being equal, which the authors believe must be taken into account.",/en/science/
"2023 Ig Nobel Prizes celebrates backward reading, counting nostril hairs and tasting rocks",    The 33rd Ig Nobel Prize ceremony on Thursday celebrated wacky scientific studies and unconventional discoveries via webcast. ,"If you can effortlessly read ""ylsseltroffe nac uoy fI"" at the start of this sentence, demonstrating your ability to read backward, you might have been a perfect candidate for the study that won the communication category prize at the 33rd Ig Nobel Prize awards ceremony on Thursday, September 14. For those not familiar with the previous 32 editions, the Ig Nobel Prize is the ultimate reward in silly and refreshing ""improbable science."" The field is intent on demonstrating that the scientific method has a serious answer to wacky questions and that there is no negative correlation between wearing a lab coat and having a sense of humor.Normally, the awards ceremony takes place in the Sanders Theater at Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts) but it has been held via videoconference since 2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic. Prioritizing the health of the spectators may not be so good for laughs but at least the tradition is preserved. The winners receive a 10-trillion former Zimbabwean dollar bill, a denomination that – despite its astronomical number of zeros – no longer has any value in the aftermath of the country's hyperinflation.Each year, 10 Ig Nobel Prizes are awarded in as many categories, which fluctuate according to the mood of the jury led by American Marc Abrahams, the mastermind behind the good-natured extravaganza. For example, the 2023 edition does not include an Ig Nobel Peace Prize, but there is one for Literature, awarded to researchers who have studied the sensations experienced when a word is written ""many, many, many, many, many"" times. The experiment is said to provoke a feeling of jamais-vu (the opposite of déjà-vu) in some people. Your humble reporter can confirm that they have never seen the word ""many"" written five times in a row in the columns of Le Monde.In the Chemistry and Geology category, the prize goes to an essay explaining why geologists are in the habit of licking – or even tasting – the rocks they collect or extract in the field. On the subject of taste buds, the winning study in Nutrition was that of two Japanese researchers who wondered whether it was possible to enhance taste sensations by eating with chopsticks and drinking with straws through which an electric current was being passed. It was celebrated as a good way of creating juicier dishes.Body experiments are a classic feature of the awards. The Ig Nobel Prize for Medicine went to a study that counted the number of nostril hairs in dead human bodies. In the Public Health category, the Ig Nobel Prize was awarded to several works led by South Korea's Park Seung-min, who developed toilets where human excretions are systematically analyzed to monitor the health of toilet-goers.",/en/science/
Cairo's historic City of the Dead under threat from urban expansion,"    Starting in 2020, ongoing road construction has been encroaching upon the Islamic necropolis on the outskirts of Egypt's capital. Despite objections from activists, numerous tombs and mausoleums of historical significance have been destroyed. ","The concrete slabs of a motorway bridge cover the mausoleum of Taha Hussein, which appears crushed under the weight of the structure. The funerary monument of the Egyptian writer, one of the fathers of the Arab literary renaissance (""Nahda""), buried in Cairo's City of the Dead in 1973, was narrowly saved from demolition. In May 2022, his descendants were alarmed by the appearance of a red cross and the inscription ""demolition"" on the wall of the entrance of the monument. The same inscription had already appeared on numerous tombs in the Islamic necropolis, located within the perimeter of road construction.The construction project, launched in 2020, gutted the site, which is over 1,400 years old and has been on the World Heritage List since 1979. Located at the foot of Mokattam, the desert plateau overlooking Cairo, it houses the dead from the beginning of the Islamic era to the present day. Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, Islamic saints, caliphs and kings, poets and commoners have found their final resting places near the mausoleums of Imam al-Shafi, founder of a school of Islamic jurisprudence, and Sayyida Nafisa, an Islamic scholar. The housing crisis has also prompted over 2 million Egyptians to come and live among the dead.Faced with pressure from the writer's granddaughter, the Egyptian authorities backed down. They spared Taha Hussein's tomb, albeit with some damage. However, hundreds of other tombs and mausoleums have been destroyed as part of construction efforts over the past three years to decongest Cairo and link it to the new administrative capital, whose construction, 45 kilometers to the east, has swallowed up billions of euros.No part of Cairo is now safe from bulldozers. In the overcrowded metropolis of 22 million inhabitants, deteriorating informal settlements have been razed and green spaces swallowed up to build bridges and housing complexes. These projects are the hallmark of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has presented himself as a modernizer since coming to power in 2013, and who has made the army the prime contractor for his major projects. The ""Greater Cairo 2050"" development plan, which calls for replacing informal settlements with green spaces and relocating cemeteries outside the city, has been revised.Demolition machinery appeared for the first time in the City of the Dead in the summer of 2020 to dig two roads through the two largest necropolises in the south and east. The road network project, unveiled in late 2021, plans to destroy more than 2,700 tombs. ""This is a crime against Egypt's heritage and history. The government wants to demolish everything and leave only 75 monuments. All they're thinking about is the value of the land,"" said Galila el-Kadi, professor of urban planning and architecture and author of a monograph on the City of the Dead.",/en/science/
"'India currently accounts for 2% of the global space market, a fraction of its capabilities'","Mathieu Weiss, the representative for the French National Centre for Space Studies in India, writes that India's Chandrayaan-3 probe landing on the moon is just the beginning of a new chapter in the sub-continent's space power.","On August 23, the Vikram lander module from India's Chandrayaan-3 probe touched down on the moon. Broadcast live, its success thrilled the Indian nation to the core, leading to the declaration of August 23 as National Space Day. It was a technological feat that roused a moment of popular fervor unprecedented in the country's recent history. In 2008, India's inaugural lunar mission aimed to place an orbiter in lunar orbit. It was through one of its instruments that the presence of ice in the deep craters of the lunar south pole was confirmed. Interestingly, the Vikram lander's touchdown at this precise location was anything but accidental. India has its sights firmly set on having a permanent presence on the moon – robotic first, then human.India began its space program by orienting it towards developing its population, at a time when the United States, the Soviet Union, France and the United Kingdom were pursuing the logic of power. Vikram Sarabhai, a young physicist from Ahmedabad, set up the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969, just 11 years after the creation of the North American Space Agency (NASA), and eight years after that of the French National Centre for Space Studies (CNES). With France's help, India had already launched dozens of French Centaure sounding rockets and a few dragon rockets; their first space cooperation agreement with CNES dates back to 1964.Today, India has become a major space power, orbiting Mars and the moon. It is preparing a mission to Venus but is also determined to put its own astronauts or ""vyomanauts"" into space. The first space flight with people aboard is scheduled for the end of 2025. Europe still lacks this capability. In a second phase, the ISRO is planning a small autonomous space station, made up of inflatable modules, for long-duration missions.But beyond space exploration, India is also distinguished for its observations of Earth and telecommunications missions, which have made life easier for its citizens. In this respect, joint French-Indian satellites have been providing the population for decades with invaluable operational services in areas such as agriculture, forecasting monsoons and water resource management. They have also given French and Indian researchers an indispensable niche for climate monitoring.With the strength of its technological capabilities, and credibility ratings comparable to those of western players, India is now preparing to enter the global market on a massive scale. The country currently accounts for 2% of the global space economy, a fraction of its capabilities, which it has amply demonstrated. But it is not happenstance: The sector's governance was hardly geared towards commercial exploitation; the ISRO holds a virtual monopoly on design and production. In-depth reforms are underway to redress the balance.",/en/science/
Libya's ancient city of Cyrene survived Storm Daniel,"    The extreme flash flooding  spared the ruins of the ancient necropolis, but the damage to a number of other significant archaeological sites remains unknown. ","The ruins of the ancient Hellenic necropolis of Cyrene, the largest in North Africa, had survived the chaos of war, rampant urbanization and the plague of looting. They also seem to have survived the devastating passage of Storm Daniel, which killed at least 4,000 people. Information is imprecise at present, as the flooding complicated access to the site. ""But no major destruction has yet been recorded,"" reported archaeologist Vincent Michel, who was in constant contact with the Tripoli and Cyrene antiquities departments. ""It will be necessary to carry out a mission to assess the exact state of the site.""A number of tombs were nevertheless damaged and the foundations of many monuments below the sanctuary of Demeter were affected by the torrents of mud. The slabs of the ancient road linking the sanctuary of Apollo to the upper town were also ripped up by the flow of water. ""The rushing water carried away a great deal of earth and stone, but none of the buildings in the sanctuary of Apollo collapsed,"" explained Michel. ""But they will have to be consolidated, as the large quantity of stagnant water makes them fragile.""The ancient city of Apollonia, known for its thermal baths and ancient port, does not appear to have suffered significant damage. ""But, as with the other coastal sites in Cyrenaica, water attacked the site and amplified the erosion,"" lamented Michel. For the time being, it is impossible to assess the extent of the damage to the Latrun site, some 30 kilometers from Apollonia, as the road leading to it was destroyed. ""However, the situation appears to be very critical in Derna, which boasts a magnificent mosque and a monastery on the seafront, among other jewels.""",/en/science/
Two Russian and one American astronauts dock at the International Space Station,"    In a rare display of international cooperation, Russian and American astronauts lifted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft amid ongoing tensions over Ukraine. ","Two Russian cosmonauts and an American astronaut docked with the International Space Station on Friday, September 15, after blasting off amid raging tensions between Moscow and Washington over Ukraine.Earlier Friday Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub and NASA astronaut Loral O'Hara lifted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft. The crew docked at the ISS three hours later, the Russian space agency said. At the orbiting station, the trio will join three Russians, two Americans, a Japanese astronaut and a representative of the European Space Agency.The liftoff took place after Russia's first lunar mission in nearly 50 years failed last month. The ISS is a rare venue for cooperation between the United States and Russia, whose ties broke down after Moscow unleashed its offensive in Ukraine last year.Kononenko alluded to the tensions during a pre-flight press conference on Thursday, saying that ""unlike on earth"" cosmonauts and astronauts took care of each other in space. ""We hear each other there, and we understand each other, and we are very sensitive to our relationships,"" he said. ""We always take care of each other.""O'Hara praised the station's ""legacy"" and said it had been bringing the countries together. ""I'm excited to get on board and see the crewmates who are waiting for us,"" she added. Kononenko, 59, and Chub, 39, were scheduled to spend a year on the ISS, while O'Hara, 40, was to spend six months aboard. It was the first mission to space for both O'Hara and Chub. Chub said that travelling to space was his ""childhood dream"" and he had dedicated ""all his life"" to reaching that goal.The three take over from Russians Dmitry Petelin and Sergey Prokopyev, as well as NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, who have spent one year aboard the ISS. While that trio was initially supposed to return in March, their mission had to be extended after their vessel, the Soyuz MS-22, suffered a coolant leak following damage from a suspected tiny meteoroid. They will now return to Earth on the MS-23, according to Roscosmos.Russian President Vladimir Putin is looking to strengthen space cooperation with China as Western condemnation and sanctions over Moscow's offensive in Ukraine intensify. On Wednesday, Putin hosted the reclusive leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, at the new Vostochny spaceport in Russia's Far East region, and the two discussed the possibility of sending a North Korean into space.Last month, Russia's Luna-25 module crashed on the Moon's surface after an incident during pre-landing manoeuvres, in a huge embarrassment for Moscow. The mission was meant to mark Russia's return to independent lunar exploration in the face of financial troubles and corruption scandals, and its growing isolation from the West. Moscow last landed a probe on the Moon in 1976, before shifting away from lunar exploration in favour of missions to Venus and building the Mir space station.",/en/science/
The world's renewed interest in lunar exploration,"India, China, Japan and Russia have all set their sights on the Earth's satellite, symbolizing a spirit of conquest. Reaching its orbit or surface is synonymous with modernity, advanced technology and even national prestige.","Three times this summer, the Moon was the object of a spatial mission. On August 19, Russia's Luna-25 lander experienced an anomaly during its final descent and crashed into the surface of our satellite. This failure prevented Moscow from reconnecting with its distant and glorious past (in 1976, the Soviet probe Luna-24 brought back samples of lunar soil) and cruelly illustrated the loss of Russian space know-how in exploration missions. On August 23, India became the fourth nation to land on the Moon with its Chandrayaan-3 mission. Finally, on September 7, Japan launched its SLIM probe which, if all goes well, will make it the fifth country to land on the lunar surface.Even though each of these three missions was modest in scope, together they are significant. They follow the major programs being conducted by the world's two leading powers. The United States is leading the Artemis program (in which the European, Canadian and Japanese space agencies are also participating), which aims to send humans back to the Moon in a few years' time. China, since 2007, has conscientiously completed successive stages of its Chang'e project, with successes such as the first rover on the far side of the Moon in 2019 and a sample return the following year. Beijing has made no secret of its ambition to send astronauts to the Moon by 2030, and even to set up a permanent base there.Why this renewed interest in lunar exploration, which had been neglected after the end of the Apollo program in 1972? There are many reasons, but as demonstrated by the pride evident in India after the successful landing of Chandrayaan-3, national prestige is not to be overlooked. There is also the desire to belong to the elite club of great space powers, synonymous with modernity and advanced technology. The Moon symbolizes a spirit of conquest, and it's hardly surprising that Narendra Modi, Xi Jinping and Donald Trump (who launched the Artemis program during his presidency) are all enthusiastic about it.On the other hand, it would be misleading to compare the Moon race of the 1960s to our times, replacing the USSR of yesteryear with China. With the Artemis and Chang'e programs, neither Washington nor Beijing is seeking to prove to the world the supremacy of its model of society, as was the case during the Cold War. Even though delays may prevent the Americans from walking on the Moon again by December 2025 as they had planned, their mastery of space technology remains far more advanced than that of China. China is still learning, with the declared aim of catching up and methodically reproducing what its Soviet and American predecessors achieved in the 20th century.",/en/science/

US opioid crisis: 'Overdoses are among the leading causes of death in several age categories',"    Epidemiologist Chelsea Shover discusses a new report about the recent findings on the opioid scourge that's ravaging the United States, more than two decades after the first wave of opioid deaths. ","The United States is sinking deeper into an opioid crisis. With some 120,000 overdose deaths predicted for 2023, the next wave seems likely to reach an unprecedented level. It's the ""fourth wave,"" in fact, pointed out epidemiologist Chelsea Shover, from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In an article published on Thursday, September 14, with her colleague Joseph Friedman in the journal Addiction, she describes its distinct characteristics.Forgive me for stating the obvious, but it comes after three other waves. The first developed in the late 1990s, fueled by the overprescription and misuse of legal opioids to treat pain. From 2010 onwards, we saw a significant increase in heroin overdose deaths among people previously dependent on opioid drugs. A few years later, around 2013, fentanyl began to take control of the illegal drug supply, with a further increase in the number of deaths across much of the US. Finally, in 2015, we began to observe that more and more deaths were occurring related to a combination of this synthetic opioid and other substances, mainly so-called stimulant drugs, cocaine and methamphetamine. What we are calling the fourth wave is unprecedented: In 2015, there were around 50,000 fatal overdoses. In 2022, the figures exceeded 110,000 deaths, and will probably be 120,000 in 2023.By a massive increase in the prescription of opioids for pain relief. This practice began to spread in the 1990s and early 2000s, reaching its peak in the 2010s. As awareness grew, health authorities took steps to limit prescriptions. But it was too late, the addicted population was too large. Heroin market forces also came into play and consumption shifted.For many users, the over-consumption of medicines was already based on illegal channels. They used painkillers bought by others: family, friends, but also people who resold them on the black market. Heroin was cheaper, and in some cases more available, as the conditions for issuing prescriptions had become stricter. The transition from one to the other, for people who were dependent and often desperate to satisfy their need for drugs, was fairly straightforward. As prescribing started to decrease, the supply of prescription opioids began drying up and heroin came in as a cheaper alternative, then fentanyl.",/en/science/
Oysters use epigenetics to fight viruses,"Attacked since 2008 by a powerful pathogen, the mollusc has found a quick defense mechanism: it modifies certain genes and, above all, their activity.","Oyster enthusiasts are a fairly widespread species. Willing to travel hundreds of kilometers to enjoy a coastal platter, they place the mollusc above all else. Some will quote La Fontaine or Lewis Carroll, while others will tell you that ancient Athenians used shellfish to vote, giving rise to the verb ""to ostracize."" Above all, they are generally experts on everything to do with the cultivation and consumption of Crassostrea gigas, the Japanese oyster, better known as the Pacific oyster.Of the 66 or so known species, the Pacific oyster alone accounts for 98% of the 130,000 metric tons produced each year on the French coast. That's a far cry from the 3.7 million metric tons farmed by the Chinese, but it still represents 90% of European production. Why a Japanese oyster on the Atlantic coast? Quite simply because, after centuries of uneventful consumption, the flat oyster was decimated by a pathogen in the 1930s. Producers then turned to the Portuguese oyster, which in turn succumbed to infection in the 1970s. This time, oyster farmers went as far as the Far East to find a resistant mollusc. But, once again, this sought-after solution came under attack. Dubbed POMS (Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome), this viral disease first appeared in the early 2000s. At first, it remained discreet. But in 2008, a new variant turned this little nuisance into a serial killer, wiping out 40% to 100% of affected larvae.Scientists then set to work. First, they realized that the herpes virus in question was attacking the bivalve's immune system, leaving it defenseless against opportunistic infections. They then studied this lethal phenomenon to try and understand how certain individuals, often entire colonies, managed to resist it. In an article published on Friday, September 8, in Science Advances, a team from the Host-Pathogen-Environment Interactions (IHPE) laboratory in Montpellier provided the answer: Resistant molluscs underwent ""rapid adaptation"" thanks to a few appropriate genetic mutations and, above all, epigenetic changes.For seafood lovers unfamiliar with the intricacies of molecular biology, it's worth noting that epigenetics isn't concerned with the genetic code and the nature of the proteins it synthesizes, but with the activity of genes, their ""expression,"" which can be strengthened or weakened by certain small chemical additions to the DNA. ""Our study has highlighted the crucial importance of these epigenetic modifications, sometimes in conjunction with genetic mutations, but sometimes in the absence of any mutation at all,"" emphasized Jérémie Vidal-Dupiol, researcher at the Institut Français de Recherche pour l’Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER, state-run oceanographic institution) and coordinator of the study.",/en/science/
NASA's Osiris-Rex capsule brings asteroid samples back to Earth,"    NASA's mission came to an end in the Utah desert, where a capsule containing 250 grams of samples collected from the asteroid Bennu landed on Sunday. ","Covering over 6 billion kilometers in space during its seven-year voyage, Osiris-Rex closely followed and examined the Bennu asteroid, collecting 250 grams of samples from it back in 2020. On Sunday, September 24, NASA's spacecraft flew by Earth in order to release a small capsule containing its precious cargo, which landed shortly before 5 pm (Paris time) in a vast 9,300 km2 military zone in the Utah desert.It was a critical maneuver, involving the smooth landing of an object originally traveling at 44,500 km/h. It all began at 12:42 pm, when Osiris-Rex, then just over 100,000 km above Earth, released the 50-kilogram capsule into space. Four hours later, it began its entry into Earth's atmosphere. Friction with the air raised the temperature of its protective shield to around 2,800°C.At an altitude of 31 km, a first parachute, 80 cm in diameter, sprang from the back of the capsule to stabilize it. A few minutes later, a second parachute, 7.3 m in diameter, took over for the final 1,500 m of descent. The entire journey was monitored by radar and cameras to help the recovery team find the capsule. The final destination for the sample will be the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, home to NASA's division in charge of foreign materials, such as moon rocks from the Apollo missions, solar wind particles and meteorites.Samples taken from asteroids are invaluable to astronomers. As Patrick Michel, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) at the Côte d'Azur Observatory and member of the Osiris-Rex scientific team, explained to Le Monde in 2019, ""asteroids are the remains of the bricks that built the planets."" In other words, they are remnants of the formation of the solar system. Unlike planets, which have undergone extensive heating and chemical metamorphosis, asteroids are only slightly transformed, preserving in a way the memory of these primitive bricks.Although not the first in situ sample of its kind, the Osiris-Rex shipment is likely to be the largest ever reported. The very first attempt, led by Japan with the Hayabusa spacecraft, ended in semi-failure. Due to a series of problems, only 1,500 microscopic grains from the Itokawa asteroid were returned to Earth in 2010. On the other hand, its ""daughter mission"" Hayabusa2 was a complete success, collecting just over five grams of material from the asteroid Ryugu. Far more than its initial target of a fraction of a gram, but far less than Osiris-Rex's estimated 250 grams. Not all of the material will be handed over to the researchers: 70% of the sample will be saved for later, until analytical techniques have progressed.",/en/science/
French scientists call for 'the implementation of a Manhattan Project for environmental transition',"A group, including Nobel Prize-winning physicist Alain Aspect and biologist Eric Karsenti, argue for the creation of a research center linked to the industry sector, similar to the American investment to develop the first atomic bomb.","Christopher Nolan's recent biographical film Oppenheimer reminded us that, in the face of a global emergency, humankind is capable of incredibly swift and effective collective action – however fateful its purpose. Five years after its inception, the Manhattan Project [which produced the first atomic bomb] was an unprecedented technical achievement. It embraced the most advanced science of the time and achieved its industrialization on a massive scale, involving over 130,000 men and women, from research laboratories to refining plants.And if humankind is capable of such feats of destruction, it can be just as capable of the common good in times of peace. At a time of never-ending climate disasters – fires, floods, heatwaves, droughts... – it is now undeniable that global warming is an existential threat. Limiting the warming and adapting to it is an imperative and overriding duty: the greatest challenge in human history. In agriculture, industry and transport, fossil fuels form the very basis of modern industrial society. Doing without them implies a new collective organization and, in particular, a profound transformation of our technical and industrial tools. Decarbonizing the energy, physical, chemical and agricultural processes that underpin the industrialized world in order to avoid millions of deaths: This is our historic responsibility.Yet the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned us: 40% of the technologies needed for environmental transition are not at a sufficient level of maturity. The agency gives the example of seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production, sodium batteries, CO2 capture or conversion, and heat storage. Unfortunately, far from contributing to the transition, many of these ""strategic technologies"" are still at the stage of laboratory experiments carried out by a few scientists with modest means.Despite the urgency, the transition has in fact not begun: Emissions continue to rise. We are failing and we are condemning our children. To meet this urgent challenge, we need to combine rapid scientific advances with massive industrial transformation. We, scientists from all backgrounds, are calling for the implementation of a Manhattan Project for environmental transition. France, and more broadly Europe, can make it happen.We are calling for the creation of a research and innovation center, tasked with developing the scientific and technological tools for the transition, in direct liaison with industry. Like CERN, the European organization for nuclear research, it will collaborate with the entire international academic and industrial fabric, including emerging and less advanced countries, and act as an open scientific and technological hub. This hub will bring together the best scientists and engineers with the means to move fast. In particular, all research will be directed towards the development of decarbonized processes and their rapid deployment on a large scale, moving them from the laboratory to industries capable of implementing the transition. In order to meet the COP21 objectives of carbon neutrality by 2050, we expect the project to have a lifespan of 25 years.",/en/science/
The Tasmanian tiger reveals its RNA,"    The thylacine, whose last specimen became extinct in 1936, is the first extinct species from which researchers have been able to recover ribonucleic acid (RNA), which translates into proteins and regulates the information carried by DNA. ","Determined to be the first to extract ribonucleic acid (RNA) from an extinct species, Emilio Marmol Sanchez with the Stockholm Paleogenetic Center and his colleagues naturally turned to the thylacine, or the Tasmanian tiger. ""It constitutes a famous example of recent human-caused extinction. The last known individual died in 1936 at Hobart Zoo,"" he said. On September 21, in the Genome Research journal, the Swedish team presented the results of their work.The aim was to prove that RNA, which is much more fragile than DNA, can also be recovered to shed light on the evolution of species that now only exist as specimens in collections. Why search for this molecule? It performs numerous functions within cells, including translation into proteins and regulation of the information carried by DNA. While the different tissues of an organism carry identical DNA, it is the activity profile of RNA that provides their specificity, and which could therefore provide more detailed information on their physiology.Recent years have seen the development of paleotranscriptomics, the science of studying ancient RNA, as a complement to paleogenomics (the search for ancient DNA, such as Neanderthal DNA) or paleoproteomics (proteins encoded from DNA). The RNA of Otzi, the famous, over 5,000-year-old ""ice man"" was recovered in 2017, along with molecules from dogs and wolves.Sanchez and his colleagues set their sights on the thylacine, the largest of the carnivorous marsupials, a specimen of which had been preserved in the Stockholm Museum since the 1890s. From muscle and skin samples, RNA sequences were successfully multiplied using PCR technology (the same used in some tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2, an RNA virus) and sequenced. However, the researchers had to ensure that the amplified RNA did not come from contamination by microbes, fungi, other animals stored in the stockpile, or humans.This is where work carried out on the other side of the world proved particularly useful. Andrew Pask and his team at the University of Melbourne proposed a first draft of the Tasmanian tiger genome in 2018, before publishing a more refined version in 2022. As DNA and RNA are complementary, the alignment of their sequences makes it possible to determine their origin by comparison. ""Our study greatly benefited from this reference genome,"" said Sanchez, adding that the sequencing of the Tasmanian devil, an endangered marsupial species related to the thylacine, was also very useful for sorting through the RNA soup.",/en/science/
"Spiders, sentinels of mercury pollution","Tetragnatha spiders feed on aquatic insects, reinjecting this heavy metal into the terrestrial food chain. They also tell us about its origin.","Mercury is a terrible poison. A ""global pollutant,"" according to scientists, because it is found all over the world. It's dreaded because it follows a convoluted path. It is found on land, but it reaches its full toxicity when transformed into methylmercury by aquatic bacteria in water. It then accumulates in all water creatures, from insects to fish. For humans, it can be harmful, particularly to the unborn. So much so that the World Health Organization has classified it as one of the 10 pollutants of greatest concern. Even though its use has been considerably reduced, gold mining, consumption of fossil fuels (particularly coal) and old industrial waste continue to pollute rivers, lakes and oceans. The European Environment Agency estimates that mercury levels in the seas are three times higher than they should be. It's worse in some lakes.Spiders of the genus Tetragnatha have a front-row seat to this sad spectacle. They even play a role in it – a secondary role, for the time being, but one that could grow, according to an article published on Wednesday, September 13, in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters. As scientists from the US Geological Survey (USGS) have pointed out, these creatures feed exclusively on aquatic insects and are eaten by frogs, snakes and birds. They therefore contribute to reinjecting the pollutant into the terrestrial food chain.Should we get rid of them? ""Certainly not,"" insisted Sarah Janssen, the principal author of the publication. ""Otters and muskrats also feed in water. Tadpoles grow up in the river and then, as frogs, emerge from it. Aquatic insects reproduce on land. They too contribute to the transfer."" Understand from this that we're not going to eradicate them all.Tetragnathes also have a trump card: They're true sentinels. They see all, and conserve all. In fact, the various sources of mercury (natural, combustion, waste) each present a particular balance between different isotopes. By analyzing the insects, fish and spiders in two tributaries of North America's immense Lake Superior, USGS researchers have shown, for the first time, that the latter retain the signature already observed in the first two.There's no contest between dragonflies, perch and spiders [for research purposes], underlined the scientists. Firstly, the spider not only provides information on aquatic pollution but also shows how mercury is transferred to the terrestrial environment. That's not all, said research coordinator David Walters. ""They're much easier to catch – you don't need any equipment other than a flashlight,"" he stated. ""They're also much more stationary, unlike fish, which are constantly on the move. So, they offer incomparable spatial information. Finally, Tetragnathes are found almost everywhere there's fresh water. So, they'll allow worldwide comparisons to be made.""",/en/science/
"'Fossils have become the foundations of a wide variety of beliefs, from Taiwan to Normandy'","    Paleontologist Éric Buffetaut explores the numerous myths and legends associated with fossils since prehistoric times. Some still endow them with healing properties, while others use them to 'ward off celestial dangers.' ","Fossils are more than just geological curiosities. Since prehistoric times, these remains of living beings preserved within the rocks of the earth's crust have been the subject of various beliefs, legends and superstitions, which have until now been largely overlooked by research in France. Paleontologist Éric Buffetaut, an emeritus director of research at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), aimed to address this by compiling the scattered traces of these myths in his latest book, Fossiles et Croyances Populaires. Une Paléontologie de l'Imaginaire (""Fossils and Popular Beliefs: A Paleontology of the Imaginary"").As a paleontologist, I specialize in vertebrates, and more specifically in dinosaurs and extinct birds. But I've always been interested in popular beliefs, out of curiosity. When I discovered that myths and legends were linked to fossils, it seemed natural to combine my scientific discipline with this personal interest.This project also aligned with a desire to fill a gap specific to France, distinct from Germany, the UK and Central Europe, where there are many books on the subject. In particular, two paleontologists warrant mention: the Austrian specialist Othenio Abel (1875-1946), who published several landmark works in the 1920s and 1930s, and the English paleontologist Kenneth Oakley (1911-1981), who was particularly interested in the symbolic and decorative uses of fossils.Maybe this lack stems from our deeply rooted rationalism, which tends to regard these beliefs as fairy tales. In any case, there are only a few scientific articles, based on the work of paleontologists, archaeologists and folklorists. I have compiled these scattered sources to put together this book, which is the first one to attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of French cases. Beliefs linked to fossils are particularly prominent in the Alps and Normandy, two regions abundant in this subject matter.It cannot be pinpointed exactly when popular beliefs associated with fossils were forged, but it is thought they have attracted human attention as far back as the Palaeolithic period (starting around 3 million years ago and ending 10,000 to 12,000 years ago). Even Neanderthals collected and gathered them: Petrified gastropods and corals have been found in caves' archaeological layers dating back over 35,000 years.Fossils have become the foundations of a wide variety of beliefs, and it's intriguing to note that these can be found all over the world. For example, healing fossils are found in China, Europe and South America. This gives rise to two hypotheses: Do these beliefs have roots in a shared ancestral origin, or are we witnessing a convergence phenomenon similar to what occurs in the evolution of living organisms?",/en/religions/
"In Casablanca, parents go all out for their children's birthdays","    In Morocco's economic capital, some families spend thousands of dirhams for their child, usually enrolled in an expensive foreign school, to blow out their candles. ","It's always the same scene: After four hours of partying in a Casablanca club, during which the kids shoot each other in teams in a laser game or scream as they cross Dubai on a virtual rollercoaster, the parents who come to collect their little ones inevitably end up reminiscing about their own birthday memories. ""In my day, it lasted an hour. It was at home with family and a cake. Mom and dad would never have imagined renting a hall for my birthday,"" explained Ilham (who, like the others we spoke to, did not wish to give her name), an insurance company employee who organized a 10th birthday party for her only son, Ali, on a recent Saturday in October.The plan: 20 or so friends, a giant cake inspired by the video game Minecraft, a mountain of gifts hidden behind a table and dozens of activities. The event lasted from 2 to 6 pm with a bevy of kids, led by an activity leader, performing a random choreography to the sound of the ""Macarena."" The cost was over 8,000 dirhams (around €750).What happened to Ilham to make her go against her parents' principles to such an extent, agreeing to spend almost three times the Moroccan minimum wage every year so that her offspring could blow out his candles? ""The desire to please him,"" she replied. ""Besides, all his friends do the same. Ali wouldn't understand if we didn't participate."" Is it out of a desire to conform to the norm? ""Not only that,"" said Mounir, a bank executive and father of two children born in Brussels. ""In Belgium, I used to hold their birthdays in a public park. We'd invite their friends, play football and board games and have a picnic. But Casablanca is a city where green spaces are sorely lacking.""For several years now, leisure centers have been springing up all over the port city, offering a wide range of birthday activities: indoors, with themed attractions (arcade games, laser games, escape games), or outdoors, in private parks on the outskirts of the city, with tree climbing, mini quad biking and even a ""kid city,"" with a recreation of a police station, post office, supermarket and school.For parents, the organization of a party follows a precise ritual: Spaces are reserved several weeks in advance, then invitation cards, complete with ""RSVP,"" are distributed in class. ""But there are always those who confirm the day before, and others who arrive at the last minute, when we weren't expecting them,"" said Khalil, a father of twins and head of a communications agency. ""You thought you had 15 kids to look after, and in fact, you're dealing with 25."" When it's not their child's birthday party, few parents stay behind.

"The demons of Stanislas, Paris's citadel of Catholic education",Investigation,"Last December, the renovated statue of Bayard, the valiant knight, was returned to its place in the courtyard of Collège Stanislas with great applause. More than a sculpture, the private Parisian Catholic school had recovered its guardian figure, whose motto ""without fear and beyond reproach"" inspired the establisment's motto, ""French without fear, Christian beyond reproach"".This symbolic choice dates back to 1872, when the clergy had to close ranks after the shameful defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the Paris Commune, which called for the separation of church and state. Louis De Lagarde, one of the founding fathers of the prestigious establishment on Rue du Montparnasse in the 6th arrondissement, where Edmond Rostand and Charles de Gaulle would study, said at the time: ""I wanted to bring about a fruitful and enduring alliance between France's religious and chivalric traditions. (...) We must prepare young people for a true crusade to safeguard religion, defend truth and uphold the fundamental principles of morality and society.""Over 150 years later, this grandiloquent call still thrills Stanislas, also known as ""Stan"". ""Ah yes, it hasn't changed! I spent three years there and found myself in a time capsule right in the middle of Paris. It's a sort of fairytale world where couples are always a mom and a dad, and where girls and boys would never, ever think of sleeping together before marriage,"" said Cécile, 24, still irritated by a place she describes as ""wrong about everything."" Frédéric Gautier, the director, seems almost amused by this kind of diatribe launched against the institution he has been proud to direct since September 2015. ""For me, Catholicism is by nature conservative, in the literal sense. It preserves the deposit of faith. The Church is against homosexual unions and abortion, as far as I know, isn't it? A Catholic school can't say otherwise.""At the beginning of summer, the director welcomed Le Monde to Stanislas, in the former 18th-century mansion where the administration is based. The old-fashioned decor adds to the formality of the place. Following in the footsteps of Father De Lagarde, Gautier presented his establishment – 3,660 students, including 750 boarders, from kindergarten through to preparatory classes – as a classic, traditional sanctuary. ""A school is a place of learning, not militancy,"" he said. ""That's why I refuse to let the wildest societal issues, such as wokeism, become a subject of concern here."" His priority, he said, is the pursuit of academic excellence.",/en/investigations/
"Hindu extremists are 'hunting down' Muslims, with impunity","    After religious violence between Hindus and Muslims in late July, radical groups like the Bajrang Dal are sowing terror in a climate of impunity. ","""We've chased away all the Muslim tailors who used to work there,"" said Ashish Kumar and Somvir Singh proudly. The two 20-something lanky companions seemed to be killing time in front of a mechanic's shop in the Badshahpur market in the town of Gurgaon and its pothole-ridden streets. Located in the state of Haryana, which borders the capital New Delhi and is home to the headquarters of multinational corporations like Microsoft and Google, the city witnessed an outburst of religious violence in early August. In retaliation for clashes that took place during a Hindu procession on July 31 in Nuh, some 40 kilometers away, Muslim-owned businesses were ransacked, a mosque was set on fire and one of its clerics murdered. The violence then spread across the state, resulting in the death of at least six people.In the days that followed, members of far-right Hindu organizations began hunting down Muslim families who had come from other states in the country to work in ""Millennium City,"" as Gurgaon is nicknamed. ""Youths from neighboring villages threatened Muslim shopkeepers with burning down their stalls, ordering them to leave,"" said Sonu Yadav, a resident who works not far from the Badshahpur district and witnessed the violence. The charred wreckage of a tire business still lies along the road, while other makeshift stores, spared by the rioters, have been left abandoned. Threatened, the owners opted to flee. The Muslim barbers who usually set up shop along the sidewalk also disappeared.Kumar and Singh boasted of having contributed to this climate of terror. Sitting on a plastic chair, Somvir argued that ""Almost 100% of the violence against Muslims is justified,"" repeating the conspiracy theories prevalent in extremist circles. Both are members of the Bajrang Dal, the youth movement of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (World Council of Hindus, VHP), an extremist group belonging to the same ideological family as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party. Founded in 1984, the Bajrang Dal is a militant organization promoting Indutva, the ruling party's Hindu supremacist project to transform secular India into a Hindu nation.Calls for a boycott of the Muslim community and threats by Bajrang Dal's members have proliferated throughout the state of Haryana. In the town of Hansi, 150 kilometers from Gurgaon, a member of the organization urged local shopkeepers to fire their Muslim employees, threatening them with a boycott. In a widely shared video on social media, he could be seen moving around town with a microphone in hand, escorted by a crowd and under the eyes of law enforcement forces. ""If in two days' time, a Muslim vendor is still there, he will be solely responsible for what happens to him,"" said the man, against whom the police have brought legal action, including for hate speech.",/en/religions/

"Descendants ask for restitution of Paris human zoo victims: 'People died, where are they?'","    The bodies of eight Kalina people from French Guiana who died in 1892 are held in national collections. Their remains could be returned to their homeland, as the French government has pledged to facilitate restitutions to overseas territories. ","On June 13, the Sénat adopted on first reading a bill that has wide support but remains sensitive. The legislation, sponsored by Senators Catherine Morin-Desailly (Union Centriste, centrist), Max Brisson (Les Républicains, right-wing) and Pierre Ouzoulias (Communist), will soon facilitate the restitution of foreign human remains held in French public collections.Up until now, a specific law required the return of any inalienable object kept in museums to be done on a case-by-case basis. Such was the situation for the Maori head handed over by the city of Rouen to New Zealand in 2011, or for the remains of the slave Saartjie Baartman, known as the ""Hottentot Venus,"" returned to South Africa by a 2002 law.""Restitutions have always been the subject of debate, as museums consider these pieces to be archives of humanity, preserved for their scientific interest. What's more, returning them has often been a government act, and when it comes to human remains, we've kept a low profile for a long while,"" said André Delpuech, general curator of French heritage and a specialist in colonial archeology. French presidents appreciate the fact that they can use these gestures to support their diplomatic initiatives. In 2020, Emmanuel Macron's handover to Algeria of 24 skulls of colonial war resistance fighters – in reality, a deposit limited to five years, in the absence of any legislation – constituted ""a deviation that should not be repeated,"" the senators stated.Now, a clear general framework should enable a more rapid response to a request from a third country to recover identified human remains on behalf of descendants. However, the collections, especially those at the National Museum of Natural History (MNHN) include French bones, including from overseas territories. In an amendment supported by Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak, the government has therefore promised to study ""a permanent procedure"" for returning the fragments from overseas. The MNHN holds 24,000 mostly anonymous human remains, 8,000 of which are French, and 1,200 of those from overseas territories.Eight of them had a tragic fate: They were Kalina (also known as Galibi), Amerindians from French Guiana who lived on either side of the Maroni River and froze to death in Paris in 1892. They are listed in the Museum's collections: six skeletons stored on racks, two others identified by casts. Thanks to the patient work of a French woman from this community, their names can now be brought to light. Corinne Toka Devilliers, head of the organization Moliko Alet + Po (""the descendants of Moliko""), is fighting so that her ancestors can return to their homeland. ""It's very painful not to have our dead by our side,"" she said.",/en/investigations/
"Yevgeny Prigozhin, Dmitry Utkin: What we know about the passengers listed aboard the Wagner plane",Investigation,"Just a few hours after the private Embraer RA-02795 jet crashed near Kujenkino, northwest of Moscow, on August 23, Russian-speaking Telegram channels went into panic mode. The list of the seven passengers and three crew members had just been published on the instant messaging app by the Federal Aviation Agency. Yevgeny Prigozhin's name was on it.The Wagner mercenary chief was not the only of the group's leaders recorded on the flight. Others, some of them high-ranking within the organization, were also supposedly on board. Thanks to open data and leaked internal Wagner documents, Le Monde has put together profiles for some of these passengers.He's the head of the Wagner Group. After several years of denying it, in September 2022 Prigozhin finally acknowledged having founded the mercenary group, in 2014. Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he has not stopped speaking out in defense of his men – even to the point of openly opposing the Russian Ministry of Defense.On June 23, 2023, Prigozhin and some of his mercenaries rebelled and headed for Moscow. The mutiny, which failed, resulted in the exile of some of his troops to Belarus.Utkin is a key figure within the Wagner group. Born in June 1970, the former member of the Russian special forces (GRU) went to fight in Syria in 2013 with the Slavonic Corps, a group of Russian mercenaries. On his return, he and his fellow fighters were arrested by the FSB. Mercenary work is officially forbidden in Russia. Utkin escaped conviction.The rest of his journey is not so clear. How, in what context and why did he meet Prigozhin? As early as 2014, he began leading soldiers paid by Prigozhin, according to Dossier Center, a group of investigators funded by Russian businessman and dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Utkin reported directly to Prigozhin and adopted his nickname, ""Wagner,"" which would soon be used to name the entire group. Since then, the Wagner Group steadily expanded its activities in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa, with the backing and complicity of the Kremlin.In an internal document seen by Le Monde, Utkin, nom de guerre ""Ninth,"" was listed as ""commander"" of Evro Polis in 2021, the Wagner Group's front company in Syria. Utkin was at the heart of the Wagner group right up to the very end.According to Dossier Center, the 47-year-old businessman held an important position within the Wagner Group. Chekalov was in charge of security and logistical support for the mercenaries. Nicknamed ""Rover"" and holder of serial number M-2444, he managed natural resource exploitation projects, particularly oil, in countries where Wagner was active.

Belarus brings in thousands of Ukrainian children to 'Russify' them,"    Minsk, with the aid of the Belarusian Red Cross, has brought more than 2,150 minors into its territory since the invasion of Ukraine, claiming to be offering them 'respite'. ","Russia is not alone in forcibly transferring Ukrainian children to its territory. Less well known is the fact that Belarus, Moscow's number-one ally in the war in Ukraine, also engages in this illegal practice, which could constitute a war crime. More than 2,150 Ukrainians aged between 6 and 15 living in Russian-occupied areas have been deported to Belarus since the Russian invasion in February 2022, according to official Belarusian documents and statements, consulted by Le Monde, and leaks compiled by Belarusian opposition politician Pavel Latushko, who was sentenced in March to eighteen years in prison in absentia in Minsk after a sham trial. A former member of the regime, Latushko submitted evidence of  Belarus' involvement in these forced displacements to the International Criminal Court (ICC) on June 27.In March, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova, for organizing the illegal transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko too could eventually be the subject of an arrest warrant.On September 13, the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning ""the illegal transfer of more than 2,150 children, including orphans, from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine to so-called recreation camps in Belarus, where they are subjected to Russification and indoctrination"". The European Parliament said that ""Alexander Lukashenko is as responsible for these war crimes as Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova,"" and called on the ICC to ""issue a similar international arrest warrant for"" the Belarusian leader.The Minsk regime makes no secret of these forced transfers. On the contrary, it claims that they are ""humanitarian"" operations designed to offer respite to war-torn children. In August, Lukashenko publicly acknowledged his direct involvement, in close collaboration with Russia. ""We agreed with Vladimir Putin that we would finance these trips from the state budget of the Union [a treaty linking Russia and Belarus],"" he said. ""We have done so and will continue to do so without worrying about any reproach.""Belarus, which has served as a rear base for Russian troops since the invasion of Ukraine, boasted that it had brought in ""over a thousand children"" in the spring.

"476,000 years old: Historic discovery of the oldest wooden structure","    An international research team has unearthed a prehistoric, wooden assemblage in Zambia that challenges our understanding of ancient humans, long before the arrival of Homo Sapiens. ","The Stone Age was also the Wood Age. But, until today, there had not been so much talk about that. While the lithic tools and shells used by prehistoric humans have stood the test of time, the same cannot be said for objects made of organic matter, which require very specific conditions to avoid decomposition. But on Wednesday, September 20, an international team announced the discovery of the oldest wooden structure ever unearthed in Nature. And it's 476,000 years old − meaning it dates from an age in which modern humans had not yet appeared.The find took place in northern Zambia, not far from the Kalambo River Falls. ""The site lies on the banks of the river, which floods regularly, bringing with it sediment. It is thanks to this permanent humidity that the wood was preserved,"" explained Veerle Rots, professor of prehistory at the University of Liège in Belgium and co-author of the study. Excavated as early as the 1950s by British archaeologist John Desmond Clark (1916-2002), the site ""had already yielded some interesting remains, but we didn't know how to date them. The chronological framework remained vague,"" added Rots.In 2019, a collaboration between the University of Liège and the British universities of Liverpool and Aberystwyth revived excavations at Kalambo Falls. In the waterlogged sands, the team discovered several wooden objects, including an astonishing cruciform assemblage. Two superimposed logs were embedded by a U-shaped notch, over 10 centimeters wide, ""clearly man-made,"" in Rots' words, who based her assertion on a series of marks left in the wood by stone tools.A tricky challenge remained: determining the period in which this structure had been produced. Carbon-14 dating was not useful, as it does not go back further than 50,000 years. To get their answer, the researchers used a technique that dates not the object itself, but the sediments in which it is buried: luminescence dating.It exploits the ability of certain natural crystals, such as quartz and feldspar, to act as dosimeters, thanks to small structural defects that act as electron traps. ""Under the effect of natural radioactivity, these crystals accumulate energy, which they release when heated or illuminated in the laboratory,"" explained said Lahaye, professor of geochronology at Bordeaux-Montaigne University and Director of the Archéosciences laboratory, which specializes in the study of archaeological heritage materials.Whenever sunlight strikes them, these grains of quartz or feldspar see their ""internal clock"" reset to zero. It restarts and accumulates energy when it's in the dark – in other words, when the sediments are buried. The amount of energy stored is proportional to the time spent in the dark. ""What we're going to measure with this technique,"" Lahaye summed up, ""is the time that has elapsed since these crystals were last exposed to light.""",/en/science/

How Ukraine is bringing the war to Russian territory,   ,"Devoured by flames, a Tupolev Tu-22 supersonic bomber slowly burns to the ground. Images of the moment quickly made the rounds across Western media. A few hours earlier, Ukrainian drones had struck Russia's military air base at Soltsy-2, near the Estonian border, on August 19, 2023. It's the launching pad for Russia's Tu-22M bombers toward Ukraine.Degrading Russia's military capabilities is not Kyiv's only objective at this stage of the war. For several months now, Ukraine has also been targeting Moscow. With the help of verified, geolocated videos, Le Monde found that the Russian capital was hit almost a dozen times between May and September 2023 by drone attacks. It's Kyiv's way of bringing the war in Ukraine, to the heart of Russia.",/en/videos/
How a rave party near Gaza turned into horror,Investigation,"Daylight was on the horizon and the music was still loud at the Supernova rave festival in southern Israel. People were smiling. Videos taken by those attending captured the scene. At around 6 am, in the distance, plumes of smoke appeared in the sky. Rockets that were fired from the Gaza Strip were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome, its anti-aircraft system. It was Saturday, October 7, and Hamas had just launched ""Operation Al-Aqsa Flood,"" a large-scale attack against Israel.Surrounded by fields and trees, the site of the rave was far away from residential areas. Between the two kibbutz of Be'eri, to the north, and Re'im, to the south, people danced less than 6 kilometers from the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. Some 3,500 people had been gathered that day.While the first rockets were intercepted far up in the sky, the DJs continued playing. But confusion quickly set in. Videos authenticated and analyzed by Le Monde show security and police officers passing among the rave-goers. They are ordered to leave the premises immediately. The instructions are also broadcast over loudspeakers. Some did not immediately understand the situation and asked why they were being asked to leave.Around 9 am, the first set of Palestinian fighters approached the venue. According to eyewitness accounts, there were dozens of them. The security force members present, barely a dozen, according to the images analyzed by Le Monde, were not equipped to deal with them. They wore neither bulletproof vests nor helmets – they just had handguns.They did, however, attempt to set up a roadblock on Route 232 a few dozen meters north of the entrance to the event. They were then joined by an Israeli Merkava tank. Equipped with a powerful 120 mm cannon, this tank was of no use at the time, except as a refuge thanks to its armored plating. Dozens of participants took cover behind it, along with some of the police. Bullets rattled. The assailants were there.Hamas commandos burst out from all sides, according to testimonies gathered by the Israeli press and Le Monde. They targeted those at the rave, firing into the crowd with automatic weapons.A car dashcam recorded part of the scene from the festival's parking lot. The moment, verified by Le Monde, shows a Hamas militiaman, armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, capturing one of the participants of the rave. Covered in blood but alive, the hostage emerged from behind the camera with his hands on his head.Seconds later, another attacker, armed with an assault rifle, appeared on the right-hand side of the screen, running towards the rear of a car.  A man was lying there, presumably wounded. The attacker shot him at point-blank range. The recording shows the time as 9:23 am.",/en/videos/

Israel-Hamas: The context behind the war,"    Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel has provoked a war that is unprecedented. It's the first time conflict has broken out on such a scale on Israeli territory, in a context that leaves less and less room for a peaceful outcome. ","During Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, which began on October 7, the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas infiltrated several hundred of its fighters into Israeli territory, killing on the spot or taking hundreds of hostages. To date, more than 1,200 people have been killed on the Israeli side, the vast majority of them civilians living near the Gaza Strip. On the Palestinian side, Israel's military response has led to the deaths of at least 830 people, according to the death toll as of October 12.The scale and violence of Hamas' surprise attack mark a new deadly chapter in the war between Hamas and Israel and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In this video, we examine the reasons behind this latest escalation.",/en/videos/
Researchers who enabled mRNA Covid vaccine win medicine Nobel Prize,    Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman have made a major contribution to the development of the revolutionary technology used in Covid-19 vaccines. ,"The Nobel Prize for Medicine is often criticized for only rewarding old scientists, usually men, who are almost always a long way from their discovery. Usually, the award is unrelated to current events, too. This year, however, the jury took the opposite route. On Monday, October 2, the Hungarian scientist Katalin Kariko, Vice President of BioNTech, and American scientist Drew Weissman, Professor of Vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania were awarded for their decisive contribution to the development of the messenger RNA vaccine. In other words, the jury awarded a woman and a man, both in their sixties – almost toddlers in the ranking – less than three years after the first use of this revolutionary technology.Meanwhile, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's messenger RNA vaccines have turned the world of research and healthcare upside down. In fact, they turned the world upside down. In the international race to immunize against Covid-19, these newcomers outstripped all previous technologies – inactivated or attenuated viruses, recombinant proteins, and viral vectors. In ten months, the two laboratories developed safe, protective vaccines. With an efficiency of 95% against the initial strain of the virus, they have even outperformed all their competitors. In Western countries, notably North America and Europe, they account for the overwhelming majority of doses administered. Without taking the slightest risk, we can therefore assert that the more than 13 billion injections of messenger RNA vaccines already carried out have made it possible to avoid an even deadlier catastrophe.The two scientists have already garnered a fine crop of awards. These include the Breakthrough Prize – the most endowed – the highly prestigious Princess of Asturias Prize and the prestigious Lasker Prize. The French Academy of Sciences also awarded its grand medal to Katalin Kariko. All that was missing was the laurels from the Swedish Academy, which everyone had been promising them for two years. Now they have them.But beware of false evidence. ""People should know that this wasn't just a one-off experiment that we did and the vaccine was made in 10 months,"" Drew Weissman told the New York Times. ""We did the modified mRNA and we are getting the honors, but the vaccines are based on 20-plus years of work by Kati and I and work by hundreds if not thousands of other scientists."" The prize list thus leaves in the shade those who came before, such as Americans Robert Malone and Philip Felgner, the first to have shown, in 1990, that a mixture of messenger RNA and fats could enter cells and produce proteins. Or France's Frédéric Martinon and Pierre Meulien, who established in 1993 that messenger RNA encapsulated in lipid spheres could trigger an immune response.",/en/science/
"What to know about Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel","    Considered a 'terrorist organization' by Israel, the United States, the European Union and many other countries, the Islamist movement was born in the late 1980s. ","Hamas, whose full name is the Islamic Resistance Movement, originated from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and was created in the wake of the First Intifada in 1987, the conflict between the Israeli army and the Palestinian population. The main goals of this Islamist movement, which does not recognize the State of Israel, have always been to reclaim the militarily occupied Palestinian territories and establish an Islamic Palestinian state.Since its creation, the movement has advocated for armed struggle and rejected peace processes such as the 1993 Oslo Accords. With its Al-Qassam military brigades, the group continues to multiply its attacks against Israel. The Jewish state always retaliates against these attacks, even if it means causing casualties among Palestinian civilians.Over time, Hamas has strengthened its ties with the Palestinian population, developed alliances with Arab countries and increased its military capabilities. Le Monde looks back over the last few decades, during which the organization has become Israel's main enemy, in this three-minute video.",/en/videos/
Israel-Hamas war: Images reveal the strategy behind the militant group's attack,Video,"The sun had not yet risen in Gaza when Hamas launched Operation Al Aqsa Flood on Saturday, October 7. Dozens of the organization's fighters advanced toward the Israeli border by car, motorcycle and on foot. They blocked cameras and defense systems and made at least seven breaches in the wall separating the two territories.Once through, the fighters simultaneously attacked at least six IDF military bases and seven civilian areas, including a town, five kibbutzim and a music festival.Using analyzed and verified images, Le Monde has reconstructed the group's master plan behind Saturday's attack, which involved lightning raids, simultaneous assaults and preparation.The border between the Gaza Strip and Israel consists of either high fences or a concrete wall. Its towers are guarded by remotely operated machine guns, so, to cross it, attackers have to neutralize its defense posts. Of the five posts filmed by Hamas militants, four were destroyed by an explosive device dropped from a drone.Also using drones, Hamas targeted telecoms infrastructures, such as a pylon near the Be'eri kibbutz. The aim: To cut off the Israeli army as quickly as possible.Elsewhere, by car, motorcycle and on foot, Hamas began its assault on the border. Some breaches were made by using hand-laid explosives, like near the Be'eri kibbutz. In a satellite image taken at the Erez Crossing, north of the Gaza Strip, a breach in the concrete wall separating it from Israel and two partial destructions could be seen.Once the border was opened, Hamas militiamen crossed it on all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and small motorcycles. At Kerem Shalom kibbutz, near the border with Egypt, the space cut into the fence was only wide enough for the motorcycles to get through.Images show that at least a dozen groups of Hamas militiamen had entered Israeli territory before 7 am. Less than an hour later, they simultaneously launched at least 13 assaults on military camps and civilian areas.At least six permanent IDF military bases were attacked at the same time, between 6:30 and 8:30 a.m. They included the Erez Crossing, the Nahal Oz military base, the base near the Be'eri kibbutz, the Sufa outpost, the Re'im base and a facility near the Kerem Shalom kibbutz.Armed with grenades, rocket launchers and extended firearms, Hamas militiamen penetrated the bases. They killed Israeli soldiers, captured others, and filmed themselves triumphantly next to their bodies. At the Nahal Oz base, they used a drone to drop explosives on groups of soldiers and armored vehicles.",/en/videos/

Gaza hospital: What detailed image analysis reveals about deadly blast,Investigation,"On Tuesday, October 17, Al Jazeera filmed the rooftops of Gaza live as it has been doing every day since the war between Hamas and Israel began. On screen, the TV channel's news banner showed that it was 6:59 pm local time when a light rose into the sky before disappearing into a flash. Eight seconds later, a new flash could be seen, this time on the ground. An explosion soon sounded at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza.Hamas quickly accused the Israeli army of bombing the hospital. According to them, 471 people were killed in the explosion. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari denied that the blast came from an Israeli air strike, and instead blamed the damage on ""an Islamic Jihad rocket that misfired.""Le Monde has authenticated and analyzed a dozen photos and videos of the blast. While these images cannot be used to ascert the origin of the explosion, they do provide a number of contextual elements, such as the trajectory of the projectile visible in Al Jazeera's video, the presence of rockets fired from Gaza in the moments preceding the explosion and the kind of damage that was caused.Located 1.4 kilometers northwest of the hospital, in the heart of Gaza, the Al Jazeera camera captured everything that happened to the east of the city. The images showed a projectile advancing from the right to the left of the screen. It formed a bell-shaped trajectory, then exploded in the sky. The images did not follow the trajectories of any debris that may have hit the ground.The camera then zoomed out and moved downward. Five seconds after the first explosion, another occurred on the ground. Three seconds later, a third, much larger explosion could be seen. Le Monde has been able to confirm that the third explosion took place inside the Al Ahli Arab Hospital, which can be identified by several buildings. Al Jazeera station reported the time as 6:59 pm local time.Israeli channel N12 also claimed to have obtained images of the moment the hospital was hit by an explosion, taken by a surveillance camera in Netivot, Israel, ten kilometers from the border. Le Monde pinpointed the camera's position, at the north-eastern end of the town. From there, it recorded everything that happened on the Gaza side, to the west.In the video, a series of lights can be seen rising into the sky, which was a salvo of projectiles, before they headed toward the right of the screen. The time was shown as 6:59 pm and 20 seconds.",/en/videos/
"The story of the Gaza Strip, explained","    Home to 2.3 million Palestinians, Gaza, wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea, has been under blockade for 16 years. This unprecedented situation is the result of a turbulent history. ","The Gaza Strip, an enclave that is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, takes its name from its shape: a long, narrow rectangle of 360 km2, wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.Gaza's borders as they exist today date back to 1967. From that time, the ""strip"" and its inhabitants lived under Israeli occupation for 38 years, until 2005. In 2006, the Islamist party Hamas, which calls for the destruction of Israel, won the legislative elections. After a Palestinian civil war that saw the historic Fatah party ousted from power, Israel, backed by Egypt, imposed in 2007 a land, air and sea blockade around the strip, which is still in place today.Following Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israeli territory, Israel's ""complete siege"" of Gaza, accompanied by massive bombardments since October 8, risks worsening an already ""dire"" humanitarian situation that will ""deteriorate exponentially,"" warned United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres.In this three-minute video, Le Monde explains how the Gaza Strip came to be, and why this enclave is so often compared to an ""open-air prison.""",/en/videos/
Why is the state of Israel located in the region of Palestine?,"    On October 7, Hamas attacked Israel, reigniting an almost century-old conflict that has shaken the region and the world. To understand this, we must go back to the creation of Israel. ","The Hamas attacks on October 7 have unleashed a war whose scale could surpass previous regional conflicts. Acts that could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity are condemned by both sides. The peace process initiated in 1993 during the Oslo Accords and the two-state solution have rarely seemed as inaccessible as they do today.In this video, we look back at a key stage in the history of this conflict: the creation of the state of Israel, from the conceptualization of Zionism to the establishment of a Jewish state in this region. This event, which was the result of European political choices made during a period of growing anti-Semitism, helped create a situation that today seems inextricable.To find out more about this seminal episode and its consequences, we refer you to the article below.",/en/videos/

The IDF said that it had retrieved ""approximately 1,500 bodies"" of Hamas members on its territory.Israel has since launched a retaliatory bombing campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. As of October 24, over 5,000 people had died, according to a count by the Hamas-run Health Ministry.",/en/videos/
Why does Israel build settlements in the occupied West Bank?,"    The West Bank, which is a Palestinian territory under international law, is dotted with numerous settlements where Israeli families and communities live. These settlements, which Israel wishes to integrate into its territory, complicate attempts to resolve the conflict. ","There are 2.8 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. But 475,000 Israelis also live in the same territory, which they call Judea and Samaria. According to the international community, this land is Palestinian, but Israelis have taken control of certain localities and made their home there. In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this is what is known as a settlement.A settlement can be as small as a few houses, or as large as an entire town with a university, as in Ariel. Under international law, they are illegal, but Israeli law recognizes a number of them and the Israeli army protects their inhabitants.In this three-minute video, Le Monde analyzes this situation and explains the three main reasons why Israelis move to settlements in the West Bank.",/en/videos/

Israel-Palestine: Six videos to understand the context behind the war in Gaza,    Le Monde breaks down the historical and contemporary context behind the conflict in these short explainer videos. ,"On Saturday, October 7, the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas infiltrated several hundred of its fighters into Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking hundreds of hostages. Later that day, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war on Hamas and launched a bombing campaign against the Gaza Strip as well as a ""complete blockade"" of the territory, banning the entry of essential items like food, water, medicine, fuel and electricity. The war has already cost the lives of thousands of Gazans (more than 7,000 as of October 26, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza).To understand this war, the latest in seven decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, we need to look at its historical roots as well as the current political tensions in the region. Le Monde breaks it down in six explainer videos.Home to 2.3 million Palestinians, Gaza, wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea, has been under blockade for 16 years.

Hamas and Israel have for years clashed with rocket fire and strikes. From 2008 to August 2023, over 6,400 Palestinians were killed, the vast majority in Gaza, while over 300 Israelis were killed in the same period, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.The State of Israel unilaterally proclaimed its existence in 1948, following a failed plan by the United Nations to partition Palestine into independent Arab and Jewish States, at the end of the region's British rule under a League of Nations mandate.

Explosion at Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza: New findings from our investigation,Investigation,"On October 17, just before 7 pm, the skies over Gaza were lit up by bright lights: a dozen rockets launched from Gaza, a missile fired from Israel, and two fighter jets. A few moments later, an explosion struck the Al-Ahli Hospital, killing a number of people that is still uncertain to this day.Two weeks after the blast, Le Monde's analysis of the images shows the trajectory and speed of a salvo of Palestinian rockets are compatible with the explosion at the hospital. Our investigation sheds light on a night of clashes, from exchanged fire to the presence of two fighter jets, probably Israeli, without establishing with certainty the cause of the explosion.At 6:59 pm, the parking lot of Al-Ahli Hospital was devastated by an explosion. Soon afterward, images revealed a crater barely a meter in diameter.As reported by the BBC, a photo taken 40 minutes after the blast shows a Palestinian police officer near the crater. He belongs to the Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD), which specializes in explosive devices and their neutralization, with duties that include collecting projectile debris and investigating explosions.Yet two weeks later, no photos of debris have been published by Hamas. According to Marc Garlasco, a former military expert for the UN, ""There's always a piece of a bomb after the fact. In 20 years of investigating war crimes, this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza."" Hamas representatives initially told the New York Times the missile ""is vaporized. Nothing is left."" They later told the Washington Post that they were in possession of remnants that ""will soon be shown to the world.""Israel was quick to blame a dysfunctional rocket from Islamic Jihad, another armed group in Gaza, and presented its evidence: Footage filmed by Al-Jazeera. The footage shows a projectile rising and then exploding in the air. In the same footage, a few seconds later, the explosion takes place in the hospital. According to Israel, this was a Palestinian rocket, whose debris landed and caused the explosion in the hospital.Using the three camera angles that show the projectile taking off, Le Monde was able to triangulate its position. It was actually fired from Israel, in an area where an Iron Dome missile system is located. This system detects Palestinian rockets in flight and attempts to shoot them down using guided missiles. According to the same images, the projectile exploded some 20 seconds after take-off, over Israeli territory.",/en/videos/

Are abortion rights under threat in France?,    French President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants to enshrine women's 'freedom' to have an abortion in the French constitution by 2024. ,"On Sunday, October 29, President Emmanuel Macron took a step toward enshrining the right to abortion in the French constitution, announcing that a bill to protect this right would be presented at the end of 2023. ""By 2024, women's freedom to have recourse to abortion will be irreversible,"" Macron said.However, some conservative and far-right leaders have criticized this constitutional reform, accusing the president of ""importing an American debate"" following the Supreme Court’s decision to eliminate the constitutional right to abortion in June 2022. The president of the Rassemblement National (far-right), Marine Le Pen, called the text ""totally useless."" ""No political movement, whether inside or outside of the Assemblée Nationale, is calling for abortion to be called into question,"" said the former presidential candidate on October 29.Yet several countries that recognize abortion as a legal right have recently clamped down on access to the procedure without actually banning it. This was the case in Poland, where since 2021, several pregnant women have died because they failed to get medical pregnancy terminations in time.In France, no political group is currently calling for a tightening of the rules governing abortion. However, not all French women have equal access to the procedure.

Germany unveils huge electricity price support package for industry,"    Announcing the deal, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the costs would be worth up to €12 billion in the next year alone. ","Germany announced on Thursday, November 9, a huge relief package including tax cuts on electricity for the manufacturing sector, in a bid to shore up an economy that many fear could end the year in recession. ""In the cIoming year alone, the relief will reach up to €12 billion,"" said Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a statement.In 2024 and 2025, electricity tax will be slashed from the current 1.537 cents per kilowatt to the European Union minimum of 0.05 cents per kilowatt for the manufacturing sector. The lowered tax could be extended for a further three years, said the government in a statement.The most energy-intensive companies most vulnerable to international competition will also have costs related to their emissions trading reimbursed under the package. The agreement on the help package for manufacturers came after weeks of hefty discussions between the industry and the German government.German companies, especially in sectors such as chemical and metal manufacturing, have struggled with a surge in power prices triggered by Russian energy supply cuts in the wake of Moscow's war in Ukraine. The higher electricity costs have undercut German exporters' price competitiveness on the global stage.For months, the economy ministry has been pushing for a cap for industrial power prices – essentially a subsidy on electricity. But the finance ministry had balked at the huge costs and warned against market distortion.Peter Adrian, the head of Germany's association of chambers of industry and commerce, called the package ""overdue"" but said it was ""doubtful if the package will be enough to ensure competitive electricity prices for the entire industry.""""Companies in services and trade too are dependent on affordable electricity prices,"" he noted, saying that there is a ""tinge of bitterness that the electricity tax hasn't been lowered in general to the minimum level"" to benefit all businesses.The German economy shrank slightly in the third quarter, while a string of recent weak economic data has added to fears of a prolonged downturn.

""If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so,"" he added.Powell's remarks come just over a week after the US central bank voted to hold its interest rate steady at a 22-year high for the second consecutive meeting, fueling expectations that it was done raising it.While the Fed's rate-setting committee is ""committed"" to achieving a sufficiently tight stance of monetary policy, ""we are not confident that we have achieved such a stance,"" Powell said. The Fed chair's comments suggest the US central bank is still concerned about the possibility of a re-acceleration of inflation, which has more than halved since peaking last year, according to the Fed's favored yardstick.But despite the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening, which brought rates to a level between 5.25-5.50% it recently noted that US economic activity remained strong in the third quarter. It also found that ""job gains have slowed in recent months but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low."" The strong economy has increased the likelihood of a so-called ""soft landing,"" whereby the Fed succeeds in tackling inflation without plunging the United States into recession.Speaking on Wednesday, Powell indicated the Fed would proceed cautiously, ""allowing us to address both the risk of being misled by a few good months of data, and the risk of overtightening.""Futures traders currently assign a probability of more than 90 percent that the Fed will vote to hold interest rates steady at its next rate meeting in December, according to data from CME Group.",/en/economy/
J.P. Morgan continues its large-scale philanthropy in France's Seine-Saint-Denis,"    Since 2018, the United States' largest bank has made the northeast suburbs of Paris the largest beneficiary of its philanthropic initiatives abroad. CEO Jamie Dimon announced a new five-year commitment on Wednesday, bringing the bank's total support to $50 million. ","In 2018, to mark the 150th anniversary of its presence in France, J.P. Morgan promised via its foundation to allocate $30 million (€26 million at the time) over five years to help the inhabitants of Seine-Saint-Denis ""benefit from new economic opportunities."" On Wednesday, November 8, Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of America's largest bank, announced an additional $20 million in philanthropic commitments over the next five years for the department that is part of the Greater Paris area.In addition, there will be a further $50 million in funds – drawn from the group's capital – intended to finance venture capital funds ""advised by women-led managers"" or ""managers positively impacting society and communities."" This ""superfund,"" entrusted to Bpifrance, is similar to a project launched in 2021 by the American firm in the United States.France is the main beneficiary, outside of the US, of J.P. Morgan's philanthropic actions, without any associated tax deduction. ""We pay a lot of taxes in France, we employ 900 people and we act as a responsible company. We're helping lift the country, and that doesn't just benefit those who are already at the top,"" said Dimon, a fan from the outset of Emmanuel Macron's economic reforms. He had met the French president that very morning.""We wanted to launch a large-scale operation in Paris, similar to what we have been doing in Detroit since 2014,"" explained Peter Scher, J.P. Morgan's vice president in charge of corporate responsibility, speaking with Le Monde. To help put America's automotive capital back on its feet, J.P. Morgan has pledged $200 million over nearly 10 years. ""Detroit and Seine-Saint-Denis are very different places, but our approach is the same: we want to act as a catalyst by supporting the right partners, in conjunction with public stakeholders,"" continued Scher.Around 20 associations active in Seine-Saint-Denis, one of the poorest areas in France but also one of the youngest, have benefited from this support. ""J.P. Morgan has taken an original approach by focusing a lot of resources on one area,"" said Quentin Moreno, deputy managing director of the Sport dans la Ville (""Sport in the City"") association, which aims to help young people who have dropped out of school find work. ""Thanks to the J.P. Morgan Foundation, we have been able to double the number of young people we support in Seine-Saint-Denis.""""We worked closely with J.P. Morgan to design programs to support entrepreneurs in these neighborhoods. We also had to ensure that this economic activity better served the local residents, which is why we focused on the building and public works sector as well as the restaurant industry: two sectors with strong local stakes in terms of employment and the attractiveness of these neighborhoods,"" explained Mathieu Cornieti, director of Impact Partners, an investment fund involved in projects in urban districts.",/en/economy/
Thomas Piketty: 'It's time for Western countries to take the BRICS seriously',"    In his column, the French economist argues that a minimum tax should be introduced on the world's most prosperous players, with a redistribution of revenues between all countries, to share power and wealth. ","The war in Gaza threatens to widen the gap between North and South. For many countries in the South, and not only in the Muslim world, the thousands of civilian deaths caused by Israeli bombardments in the Palestinian enclave, 20 years after the tens of thousands of deaths caused by the United States in Iraq, will doubtless embody the West's double standards for a long time to come.All this is taking place against a backdrop in which the main alliance of so-called emerging countries, the BRICS, has just been strengthened at its Johannesburg summit a few months ago. Initially created in 2009, the BRICS have comprised five countries since 2011: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Expressed in terms of purchasing power parity, the combined GDP of these five countries will exceed €40,000 billion by 2022, compared with just €30,000 billion for the G7 countries (United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom and Italy), and €120,000 billion on a global scale (an average of just over €1,000 per month for the world's 8 billion people). Differences in average national income per capita remain considerable, of course: almost €3,000 per month in the G7, less than €1,000 per month in the BRICS and less than €200 per month in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the latest data from the World Inequality Lab.In a few words, the BRICS present themselves to the world as the planet's middle class – those who have succeeded, through hard work, in improving their condition, and who have no intention of stopping there.In 2014, the BRICS created its own development bank. Based in Shanghai, it remains modest in size but could compete with the Bretton Woods institutions (International Monetary Fund and World Bank) in the future if they do not radically reform their voting rights systems to give greater prominence to the countries of the South.At the Johannesburg summit in August, the BRICS decided to welcome six new members (Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia and Iran) from January 1, 2024, reportedly chosen from among some 40 candidate countries.Let's face it: It's time for Western countries to overcome their arrogance and take the BRICS seriously. It's easy to point out the many inconsistencies and contradictions within what remains a loose, largely informal club. China's political model increasingly resembles a perfect digital dictatorship, and no one wants it any more than Russia's military kleptocracy. At least that guarantees the other leaders that the club won't stick its nose in their business.",/en/economy/
Myanmar junta attempts to attract tourists in a quest to bring in foreign currency,"    Tourist operators in France are readily promoting a country under military dictatorship rule since the coup d'état of February 1, 2021. ","Despite being under a military dictatorship, where almost 20,000 political prisoners are locked up, most of them tortured, Myanmar is also a ""world of light, art, living legends and a new-found serenity,"" according to the website of Paris-based cultural travel agency Clio. This agency is organizing a trip there in January 2024 including on the itinerary a visit to Pagan and its ""10,000 pagodas"" and a trip on the Irrawaddy River.Almost three years after the military coup of February 1, 2021, which overthrew Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, the junta is attempting to attract tourists from around the world as part of its quest to bring in foreign currency. In the 2022-2023 tax year that ended in March, the country gave out almost 370,000 tourist visas, up 187% on the previous year. Most of these visitors came from China, Russia, India and the Middle East. This figure is still a far cry from the four million tourists welcomed each year before the Covid-19 pandemic struck.At the IFTM-Top Resa trade show held in Paris at the start of October, tourism agencies at the Thai pavilion – there was no Myanmar stand –discreetly promoted Myanmar. The French federation Les Entreprises du voyage even published photos of the country on social media, before taking them down without any explanation.The French NGO Info Birmanie was concerned that this promotion of tourism ""normalizes the situation in the country while legitimizing the junta,"" according to its coordinator, Johanna Chardonnieras, who was must upset at an article published by Le Figaro on February 19 entitled ""When's a good time to go to Myanmar in terms of weather and climate...? The best times to go for each region.""In March, the NGO lodged a complaint with the French journalistic council for ethics and mediation [Conseil de déontologie journalistique et de médiation], denouncing the ""range of advertising propaganda currently deployed by the military junta with a view to making a tourist destination out of a country in chaos."" The complaint was eventually declared unfounded, and Le Figaro added a paragraph of context on the 2021 coup d'état, specifying that any travel there was ""not recommended."" ""This article is one of a long list of generic publications aiming simply to offer practical advice, such as the best dates for vacations in as many destinations around the world as possible,"" explained Marc Feuillée, General Manager of the Le Figaro Group, adding that the article ""was not commissioned by any tourist office.""",/en/economy/
Prince Harry wins in latest round of UK media litigation,"    The case for 'unlawful information gathering,' brought against British tabloid publishers by the former royal and others, was ruled 'a worthwhile claim', and could go to trial. ","The publishers of two UK newspapers on Friday, November 10, lost a bid to have a case for unlawful information gathering brought against them by Prince Harry and others thrown out of court, opening the way for a possible trial.Lawyers for Associated Newspapers (ANL) – publishers of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday – had argued that the claims were brought too late. But in a written ruling, Judge Matthew Nicklin disagreed and said the case could go ahead.The ruling is the latest chapter in Harry's turbulent relationship with the press, whom he holds responsible for the death of his mother Princess Diana in a 1997 Paris car crash as she fled paparazzi. Other claimants are pop star Elton John, his husband David Furnish, the actors Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, politician Simon Hughes, and Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was killed in a racist murder in 1993.ANL had ""not been able to deliver a 'knockout blow' to the claims of any of these claimants,"" the judge said in his 95-page ruling. ""In my judgment, each claimant has a real prospect of demonstrating that Associated [...] concealed from him/her the relevant facts upon which a worthwhile claim of unlawful information gathering could have been advanced,"" he wrote.Harry and the other claimants accuse ANL of methods such as hiring private investigators, tapping phone calls and impersonating individuals to obtain medical information for articles. The court has been told the alleged wrongdoing dates back to 1993 and continued to as late as 2018. ANL has dismissed the allegations, arguing the case should not go to trial.Harry, 39, and his wife Meghan, 42, quit royal duties in 2020 and relocated to California, in part blaming media attention for the move. The prince, who is formally known as the Duke of Sussex and is the younger son of King Charles III, has vowed to make reforming the British media his life's mission. The case is one of a number of legal battles he is waging with different UK newspapers over privacy concerns.",/en/economy/
"Living in low-income housing in upmarket Paris: 'Once you're here, everything changes'",    Some of the capital's public housing tenants live in neighborhoods with unmet social diversity quotas and where local residents are sometimes reluctant to welcome newcomers. ,"She was everywhere that evening. On September 14, as the Paris municipal team inaugurated the transformation of former Ministry of the Armed Forces offices into public housing in the very chic 7th arrondissement to the sound of a small brass band, Rachida Dati (Les Républicains, LR, center right), the arrondissement's mayor, was in every selfie. There were hugs, broad smiles, a word for everyone and an impromptu photo in the middle of the orchestra. It would have been hard to guess that in 2017, she hadn't backed this unprecedented project to add 254 social housing units on this exceptional site, located a few steps from the Assemblée Nationale.At the arrondissement council meeting, she lamented that most of these housing units would not be allocated to residents of the 7th because their incomes were too high. Citing the example of a similar operation to create social housing on the remarkable site of the former Laennec hospital, she deplored having to ""regularly police it."" ""When owners bought their homes for €10,000, €15,000 or €20,000 per square meter, and someone living across the street is throwing things over the balcony, or the common areas are not respected, the residents feel cheated at having saved up to find themselves in a situation of permanent conflict,"" Dati declared.A few days later, at the December 2017 Paris council, her deputy, Emmanuelle Dauvergne, voted against the project because it included too many ""very social"" housing units. Worrying about ""the ghettoization of entire buildings in the heart of Paris,"" she said the initiative ""would destabilize the neighborhood, our schools and our local businesses.""Six years later, there was a joyful fairground atmosphere in the cobbled courtyard, where the children of the many tenants had gathered to celebrate their move-in. The band's brass instruments contrasted with the calm of Rue Saint-Dominique and its art galleries.The French Ministry of the Armed Forces had agreed to set aside around 50 housing units for its troops. Among them, 43-year-old Valérie (all those mentioned by their first names wished to remain anonymous), a soldier previously based in Lyon, was delighted to find herself on this chic area, ""especially for its security. I'll have peace of mind for my children.""Kuthubkhan, a restaurant owner originally from Sri Lanka; his wife; and their two children were able to leave their one-bedroom apartment in the 10th arrondissement's social housing stock for a three-room apartment in a neighborhood where he expects ""the schools to be better."" Sandrine (her first name was changed), a victim of domestic violence for several years, was given a three-bedroom apartment quickly after submitting her application. ""For me, a new life is starting. I've been free for two weeks now,"" she said. ""The neighborhood is incredible. We're surrounded by monuments. It's a privilege, and I wasn't asking for this much. I'm living a daydream.""",/en/economy/
'Joe Biden's economic record is not a good enough argument for the Democrats to win the next election',"    As the incumbent US president prepares to run for a second term, Americans are not convinced that the Biden administration has improved their lives, despite flattering macroeconomic data, Stéphane Lauer writes. ","A slogan does not a track record make. Joe Biden is learning this the hard way. For several months, the US president has been criss-crossing the country to tout ""Bidenomics,"" a generic name he has appropriated to refer to the economic policies he has been pursuing for almost three years. But as he prepares to run for a second term, the White House's after-sales service is struggling to convince Americans that Biden has improved their lives, despite flattering macroeconomic data.After the shock of Covid-19, growth rebounded faster than elsewhere, and it continues to accelerate. No country has been spared from inflation, but it is slowing faster in the US. As for unemployment, the rate was 6.3% when Biden arrived at the White House. Three years later, that rate has been almost halved and 14 million jobs have been created – an unprecedented figure for a single term in office.Yet voters tend to see the glass as half empty. Two-thirds disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy. An ABC News-Washington Post poll indicates that a third of voters consider the jobs situation to be poor. According to a Yahoo!-Ipsos survey, only 21% of Americans feel that results are better than in other developed countries. Finally, two out of three don't believe inflation is coming down.""Even if the United States is doing well, 'Bidenomics' isn't making an impression on the population, and that's a disaster for the Democrats,"" said Laurence Nardon, a researcher at the Institut Français des Relations Internationales and author of a memo on Biden's economic policy. The president may perceive a certain ingratitude on the part of his compatriots, after he launched a vast program of investment and financial support for the middle class. He has taken protectionist measures to revive industryand helped trade unions, which are seen as the best way of improving living standards for wage earners. The aim is to close the liberal parenthesis that was begun under Ronald Reagan and restart social mobility, in order to turn voters away from the populist temptation of Donald Trump.A poll published in early November by the New York Times confirms that anything could happen: With a year to go before the election, Trump would win with a substantial lead in five out of six key states. Only 2% of those surveyed consider the economic situation to be good. One of the survey's findings is that voters are more concerned about inflation than jobs, while feeling that Democrats are focusing more on jobs.",/en/economy/
IMF managing director Georgieva: 'We have placed too much emphasis on the benefits of globalization',"    Kristalina Georgieva, in an inteview with Le Monde, expresses concern about the risk of the global economy fragmenting and rising geopolitical threats. ","While inflation is finally easing, the Middle East crisis and geopolitical risks could once again push up oil prices, warns Kristalina Georgieva. While visiting Paris from November 9 to 11, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spoke with Le Monde. She warned of the risk of fragmentation of world trade, which she believes is likely to increase poverty and insecurity for all.For a long time, we have placed too much emphasis on the benefits of globalization. They have been considerable: Over the last three decades, the global economy has tripled, in particular to the benefit of developing economies which have quadrupled, and the result has been an incredible reduction in poverty.But not everyone benefited from it. For too long, insufficient attention has been paid to those whose jobs and livelihoods have evaporated, because compensation mechanisms have been insufficient. This has created fertile ground for anti-globalization movements and populism.Worse, since the pandemic, we have witnessed a series of exogenous shocks that lead to massive interruptions in supply chains. This may push companies to want to bring part of their production closer together. But this is not without problems because it concentrates the risks in the same place in the event of a new shock.We cannot return to the past model, in which too many people lost out, and which does not sufficiently recognize that the security of supplies is also a question of economic security and not only national security. We need to rethink globalization as much as possible in collaboration with our partners. Our advice for countries is to not play the national interest card against others, but think about mechanisms to continue global integration and balance risks. Because greater fragmentation of global trade would have a very clear consequence: We would all be poorer and less secure.Depending on the scenarios, it could amount to between 0.2% and 7% of global gross domestic product (GDP). Seven percent, the extreme case, would be equivalent to excluding two countries like Germany and Japan from the global economy. To limit this risk, we must resist the temptation to impose trade barriers, the number of which has increased from around 500 in 2017 to 1000 in 2019 to 3000 in 2022.However, our research shows that if one of the three major economies in the world, the United States, Europe, China, takes a fundamentally protectionist measure, the probability that a partner country will take a protectionist measure in response is 73% within 12 months. This is a dangerous slope.",/en/economy/
Sixty European banks suspected of influencing tensions in South Sudan,"    The NGO Global Witness accused Deutsche Bank, Alliance, ING, and five major French financial establishments of financing two Chinese and Malaysian oil groups implicated in violence affecting the African country in the grip of civil war since 2013. ","Sixty European banks, insurance companies and investment firms have directly or indirectly financed two international oil groups implicated in violence in South Sudan, the non-governmental organization Global Witness, which specializes in the impact of natural resource exploitation on the environment and human rights, has claimed.Among the names singled out in the report published on Tuesday, November 14, are those of German groups Deutsche Bank and Allianz, Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo, the Netherlands' Aegon and ING, and France's BNP Paribas, BPCE, Crédit Agricole, Crédit Mutuel CIC and Société Générale.The NGO has identified more than €700 million in direct or indirect shareholdings by these European financial institutions in the oil group China National Petroleum Company (CNPC), the Malaysian company Petronas, and their listed subsidiaries, as well as €4 billion in loans and commissions received from bond issues by the two companies.Global Witness has accused CNPC and Petronas of encouraging intermittent violence in South Sudan, which has been independent since 2011 and, since 2013, has been in the grip of a civil war that has led, according to the United Nations, to the deaths of several hundred thousand people and the displacement of around 4 million people.Petronas is a shareholder in South Sudan's three major crude oil producers, Dar Petroleum Operating Company (DPOC), Greater Pioneer Operating Company (GPOC) and Sudd Petroleum Operating Company. Although the Malaysian oil company announced in December 2022 that it would sell its interests to the UK's Savannah Energy, the sale has not yet taken place, and the Chinese company CNPC still has a stake in DPOC and GPOC. Since 2018, Sudan's three oil companies have been on the list of entities that the United States deemed likely to pose a threat to national security.At the time, the US Commerce Department concluded that these companies represented a significant source of revenue ""to fund the purchase of weapons and other material that undermine the peace, security and stability"" of South Sudan.Global Witness hopes that the financial groups cited will be able to change the way they do business, but also intends to put pressure on European politicians who are debating the inclusion of the financial sector within the scope of the CSDD directive on corporate sustainability due diligence.BPCE denied that they are financing the companies in a reply to Global Witness. CIC said it has had no business relationship with Petronas since 2019 and stated that it never participated in financing activities in South Sudan, while Crédit Agricole said it has not financed Petronas ""for several years."" BNP Paribas and Société Générale made no comment on their relations with specific companies, but the former explained that Petronas is concerned by its strategy of exiting from fossil fuels, in other words: the bank could exclude the oil group from its investments. BNP said it applies ""a strict framework to the management of environmental and social risks.""",/en/economy/
Paris will have residents vote on increasing parking fees for heavy SUVs,"    The vote, to be held in February, will be the second city-wide referendum on urban matters, after residents in April voted to ban rental e-scooters from the capital.

The vote, to be held in February, will be the second city-wide referendum on urban matters, after residents in April voted to ban rental e-scooters from the capital. Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) can weigh 2,700 kilos or more, around a third more than regular automobiles.""They're accident-prone, heavy, bulky and polluting,"" the mayor's office said, and had been identified as ""the cause of many problems in the public space."" Quoted in the statement, Hidalgo said the fee increase would be ""very significant."" She did not, however, give a figure, or say what weight threshold would make an SUV ""heavy.""If the vote goes in favor of the fee hike, it would not concern SUV owners with residential parking permits issued by the city. The mayor's office said it hoped to send ""a message"" to auto companies inciting them to stop ""their race to gigantism that is unsuitable to quality of life in the city.""This, it said, would ""allow an improved sharing of public spaces in favor of clean mobility, streets with schools and pedestrians."" SUVs accounted for 49% of new passenger car sales in the European Union last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.In April, Parisians voted overwhelmingly to banish for-hire electric scooters from the streets of the French capital.

'The Indian New Year is also a time for economic hope',"The good economic health of the world's fifth-largest economy stands in stark contrast with the latest Chinese figures, which show a significant decline in consumption and exports.","On Sunday, November 12, India turned on the lights. Or rather, millions of lights. Thus began Diwali, the festival celebrating the victory of light over darkness. It's Indian Christmas, celebrated over five days when people give each other gifts and wish each other all the best for the coming New Year. The first gift, of interest only to economists and politicians, will be the publication of October's inflation rate.This should confirm the decline in price rises, which had reached 7% in July before receding in the following months and should, according to analysts, hover around 4.8%, close to the 4% target the central bank had set itself. It was therefore right not to raise rates, believing that the rise was temporary, due to the monsoon disasters.The new Indian era also opens with a piece of news that is exciting to the whole subcontinent: The country has qualified for the semi-finals of the World Cricket Championship, which will take place in India. India will take on New Zealand, while Australia will face South Africa. The country's former ruler, England, has thus bitten the dust, which is not to the displeasure of the Indian in the street.But this Indian New Year is also one of great economic hope. Its economic growth is the strongest of any major country. Its gross domestic product has risen from $2,000 billion (€1,871 billion) in 2014 to $3,750 billion in 2023. As the world's fifth-largest economy, it has not only overtaken the United Kingdom in cricket. Its demographics and youthful population, coupled with strong investment in infrastructure and digital technology, have created the conditions for exceptional momentum. Added to this are reforms in taxation, banking and the opening up of markets. Its global successes in digital services and pharmaceuticals could well be enriched by the development of an alternative industrial base for a China neglected by the West.All this contrasts strangely with the latest Chinese figures, which have marked a dramatic slowdown in consumption and exports. Deflation is threatening in a country aging at great speed. But, as in cricket, the match will be very long and unpredictable. The Indian team will have to fight its old demons: endemic corruption, a failing education system, an archaic social structure and an increasingly authoritarian political regime. The light has not yet conquered the darkness.",/en/economy/
'Indiana Jones of the Art World' recovers six historic paintings,    The Dutch art sleuth Arthur Brand recovered the six paintings just weeks after he found a stolen Van Gogh stuffed in an Ikea bag. ,"A Dutch art detective dubbed the ""Indiana Jones of the Art World"" has recovered another six paintings, including a portrait of William of Orange and the first depiction of a seventh-century king.Art sleuth Arthur Brand made headlines around the world last month when he recovered a stolen Van Gogh stuffed in an Ikea bag, and he believes that widely publicized success is leading to more discoveries.Thieves made off with the latest six paintings from the town hall of Medemblik, in the north of the country, last month. While the monetary value of the haul is not huge – around €100,000 ($105,000) – the paintings are considered of great historical significance, including the earliest known portrait of Radbod, king of the Frisians from 680 AD.Brand was sitting at home on Friday night watching football when the doorbell rang and a man in a van asked him for help to unload some merchandise. ""I asked him, 'What are we going to unload?' He said with a smile, 'Well, the paintings of Medemblik,'"" Brand recounted.After the initial burglary in September, Brand had been widely quoted in the Dutch press as saying the thieves should have stolen six bikes, as these would be easier to resell. Those comments, plus the publicity surrounding the Van Gogh recovery, probably led the thieves to simply hand the paintings back, explained Brand.""In some cases, they burn them, just to get rid of the evidence because they find out they cannot sell them,"" he told Agence France-Presse (AFP). ""So I'm very thankful that they decided to do the right thing. Stealing is wrong, but if you return it, at least you do something right,"" he added.Now Brand is hoping that the momentum from the Van Gogh will lead to another prize recovery – a masterpiece by Frans Hals called Two Laughing Boys. He also has his eye on recovering work from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, where paintings worth an estimated $500 million from the likes of Vermeer, Manet and Rembrandt were stolen in 1990.The authorities in Medemblik had offered a reward of €10,000 for the safe return of the paintings but this has gone unclaimed. Brand said he would not be collecting the cash himself. ""I told them to give me a good book voucher,"" he quipped.",/en/culture/
'Killers of the Flower Moon': Scorsese's epic revisits the silent massacre of the Osage tribe,"    Martin Scorsese's true crime film depicts the series of murders committed in the 1920s against the Osage Nation Native American tribe, mirroring the erasure of Native Americans from the US. ","After The Irishman (2019) was confined to Netflix, it's a delight that 80-year-old Martin Scorsese's latest film, financed by Apple, is making its way into cinemas. The remarkable Killers of the Flower Moon, his 27th feature film in his 60-year career, unfolds as a territorial epic – but with a secret side. It tells a dark tale of insidious invasion and evil contamination, painting one of the most appalling pictures of American history.The film draws on the historical vein of Scorsese's body of work (such as The Age of Innocence, The Aviator and Silence), is a counterpoint to his punkish moments (namely, The Wolf of Wall Street and Bringing Out the Dead) and brings him back to his typical formal extravagance. In fact, this adaptation of journalist David Grann's investigation unfolds with the characteristics of a more classical style of filmmaking, in the noblest sense of the term, that is sure of its strengths and not without an instructive aim.Indeed, the aim is to bring to light a massacre buried by history and committed discreetly, that of the Osage Nation Native American tribe that was targeted by white despoilers in the 1920s. At the end of the 19th century, as the film begins with reconstructed fake newsreels, oil deposits were discovered in Osage territory in their Oklahoma nature reserve. Its exploitation caused the people to become ""the wealthiest social group in the world per capita"" overnight.The region's industrial development immediately attracted a diverse range of opportunists, including seemingly respectable businesspeople, offended by these affluent Indians as if it were an affront to the natural order, and they had come to redirect these streams of wealth into more respectable pockets, which they considered to be their own. Gradually, violent killings on the Osage side grew in such proportions that they eventually justified the intervention of a federal police force in its formative period, under the direction of John Edgar Hoover.The story opens in the aftermath of the First World War, when Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), an out-of-work veteran, took the train to Gray Horse, a boomtown that had sprung up in the oil-rich plains. There, he met his uncle, William Hale (Robert De Niro), a prominent local rancher. Under the guise of philanthropy, the patriarch nicknamed ""King,"" a self-proclaimed protector of the Native Americans, orchestrates a sordid inheritance grab by marrying off his sons and nephews to Osage young ladies, who are then slowly eradicated.",/en/culture/

A few petroleum-black chocolate discs were laid out on trays, offered for tasting to the dozen or so privileged guests who had been invited by Alain Kablan Porquet, the establishment's owner and an artisan chocolatier at the head of the Cocoaïan cooperative.But be careful, you don't bite into a 92% cocoa chocolate like an industrial chocolate bar. ""Put the chocolate in your mouth and crunch very lightly to release the flavors,"" said Kristen Hard, a multi-award-winning American chocolatier and CEO of the high-end boutique Cacao Atlanta. ""Then let it melt on your tongue. You can inhale at the same time to fully take in the flavors."" With a solemnity similar to a wine tasting, one after the other, invitees tasted Ghanaian and Ivorian chocolates, from FairAfric and Cocoaïan, whose cocoa content amounts to 75 or 92%.These little discs, with their delicate notes of flowers or fruit, are the first samples of a greater ambition: transforming a cocoa-producing nation into a chocolate-producing nation. The paradox is well known: Côte d'Ivoire alone supplies 45% of the world cocoa market, but half the beans are exported raw and almost all the rest in the form of semi-processed products.There are only 24 chocolate makers in Côte d'Ivoire, half as many in Ghana. To expand the market – Porquet aims to increase their numbers tenfold over the next few years – he brought together Ghanaian and Ivorian players in the cocoa industry from November 2 to 4, just as the Salon du Chocolat was coming to a close in Paris. The immediate goal was to create a new, specifically African chocolate competition, the World Chocolate Initiative Competition, which is scheduled to be held for the first time in mid-2024.Ultimately, the aim is to launch a debate on the chocolate production standards set by European markets and to usher in a new era of cocoa production, in which power would return to producer countries. This comes at a time when the price of brown gold broke new records on the London and New York stock exchanges on October 30, thanks to the current quarter's poor harvest, which could turn out to be almost 30% less than last year's.""Chocolate is not a consumer product,"" thundered Gauz on the low sofa reserved for the invited speakers at the Bushman Café. ""It's pure thought, pure intellect! It's culture!"" In front of a small audience of journalists, industrialists and researchers, the Ivorian writer, author of the book Cocoaïans (2022), said angrily: ""Cocoa is not a native plant. It was imposed on us by a European bourgeois whim. Cocoa is an issue of civilizational thought, the site of a confrontation between African peasants, who produce this cocoa while destroying their ecosystem, and the hyper-bourgeoisie, who invented the taste of chocolate and imposed it through violence.""The 2.4 million tons of cocoa that leave the fields of Côte d'Ivoire every year are described by Gauz as ""2.4 tons of misfortune!"" ""The first crime we committed – a collective one – was to have perpetuated the colonial economic system. Coffee, cocoa, rubber, palm oil ... there's nothing new being produced here! This is the idea that needs to be put back at the heart of the debate. We need to rethink a class relationship, a relationship of domination.""To reverse this relationship, Porquet advocates for ""the non-nomadization of food."" Between two workshops, he settled into a corner of the Bushman Café, on a Louis XV armchair said to have belonged to Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. ""We want everything to be made locally,"" he explained, ""like wine or haute couture. We can move away from the role of supplier of raw materials and market a high-quality finished product, for both local use and for export.""This is because he is convinced that the alkalinization systematically practiced by chocolate manufacturers ""kills"" cocoa. ""Potash is designed to level out the taste. It removes bitterness, astringency and acidity. But if there's a need for that, it's because there was a fermentation problem from the start!"" His intention is to buy freshly harvested cocoa pods directly from farmers in Ivory Coast so that he can do the shelling, fermentation and drying himself. The producer saves time and money (Cocoaïan buys the beans above the fixed minimum price), and the chocolate maker retains control over his raw material from the outset. In other words, the Cocoaïan company is able to produce ""fine cocoa"" from Forastero pods, the variety grown in West Africa.The Ivorian chocolate maker has seized on a fermentation method invented by Dutch consultant Albertus Eskes, a former researcher at the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD, International Agronomic Research Cooperation Center), who, by his own admission, was ""married to cocoa for 53 years."" His ""Anima"" technique, developed in Brazil from 2015 to 2019 and recently applied by some producers, including Cocoaïan, eliminates bitterness and astringency from the bean without artificial alkalinization, but with guaranteed effectiveness on any cocoa variety. It's a simple, inexpensive method,"" confirmed Eskes. ""It can be applied by any farmer, anywhere in the world, without the addition of laboratory-grown yeasts, but simply with crates of fruit.""Far from wanting to protect their secret, Porquet and Eskes invited government representatives to convince them to deploy the method on a large scale. Beyond the competition, the aim is to establish national certification for cocoa production, based on the implementation of Anima fermentation. The Conseil Café-Cacao (CCC, Coffee-Cocoa Council) was present on the first day for discussions behind closed doors, and the CNRA on the following days.Enthusiastic cocoa breeder and CNRA research coordinator Mathias Tahi plans to meet with the CCC soon to share his observations and, perhaps, launch a nationwide public-private partnership. ""The world needs to know about Côte d'Ivoire's great capacity to produce quality cocoa,"" he said. ""For us, it's a niche market that's opening up, with far greater added value for the entire industry."" The certification also involves a small revolution: full price transparency. Farmers will know the price at which the chocolate produced from their beans is sold.""",/en/economy/
Bad Bunny releases an 'uncompromising' album,"    The most-streamed artist in the world for the past three years, Bad Bunny has conquered the English-speaking market with Spanish tracks. His fifth album, released on October 13, is dark and uncompromising. ","As the most-played artist on streaming platforms for the past three years, Puerto Rican Bad Bunny – real name Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio – has achieved a tour de force. He dethroned Britain's Ed Sheeran and Canada's Drake, with tracks performed solely in Spanish. The former choirboy is the first Latino rapper to top the American charts with two full-length albums, El Ultimo Tour del Mundo and Un Verano Sin Ti, both in Spanish – not even Ritchie Valens' ""La Bamba"" (1958) did better. All this while the rapper has branded himself with a ridiculous name worthy of a Mexican wrestler. The cover of his fifth album, Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana – released on Friday, October 13 – is thus full of meaning: A rider who masters his mount during a rodeo, the quintessential gringo sport.Another tour de force for Bad Bunny is that he hasn't won this award with the festive reggaeton of his predecessors – Daddy Yankee or Don Omar – but with music inspired by Atlanta trap. In this darkest form of trap, his style is close to that of Travis Scott, on whose track ""K-Pop"" – from Scott's latest record, Utopia – he featured. Bad Bunny has the nerve to challenge his American colleagues on their home turf in Spanish. This is the challenge he has set for himself once again on this 22-track album, overall sad ones. Only two titles at the end of the tracklist, ""Perro Negro"" and ""Un Preview,"" have the typical reggaeton rhythm. ""No Soy Trapero, Ni Reggaetonero,"" is how he described himself in this fifth opus.Right from the start, as if to drive the point home, Bad Bunny launches into a long, six-minute monologue set to solemn violins. He looks back on his early career in the track ""Nadie Sabe"" (""No one knows"" in English), addressed to his detractors as much as to his new fans who have made the mistake of not knowing him since his first releases: ""Diles"" (2016) or his song with rapper Cardi B and Colombian artist J Balvin, ""I Like it"" (2018).He does not take the easy road: He takes a stand against the murders of transgender people, protests against the corruption and homophobia of a governor in Puerto Rico, doesn't hesitate to dress as a drag queen in his ""Yo Perreo Sola"" video and defends sexual fluidity. ""Twenty years from now, I'll be able to love a man,"" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2020. In the meantime, his new girlfriend is model Kendall Jenner – little sister of the Kardashians – with whom he parades around in Gucci bags.Luxury and the desire to be among the happy few who attend the Monte Carlo Rally is the theme of his second track, ""Monaco."" It is a ""revenge on life"" for this son of a truck driver and a schoolteacher, who was bagging groceries for supermarket shoppers when he began his career, by broadcasting his tracks on SoundCloud. On this egotrip number, he samples Charles Aznavour's voice for his chorus: ""Hier encore, j’avais 20 ans, je caressais le temps/J’ai joué de la vie."" (""Just yesterday, I was 20, I was caressing time/I played with life."")",/en/culture/
"Geoffrey Standing Bear, Osage chief: 'It is amazing for us to see our voice being discussed and listened to'","    The Native American Principal Chief told Le Monde how his community viewed the production of 'Killers of the Flower Moon,' which looks back at the massacres they suffered at the beginning of the 20th century. ","Killers of the Flower Moon, Martin Scorsese's new film, is an adaptation of Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, a 2017 nonfiction book by American journalist and writer David Grann. Both shed light on the tragic fate of the Osage people, forced in the 19th century to settle in Oklahoma, in the United States's Great Plains. The discovery of oil on their lands in 1894 made them rich, but between 1918 and 1931 they were struck by a series of massacres as mysterious as they were barbaric.Grann is full of praise for Geoffrey Standing Bear, elected as principal chief in 2014 to lead this community of 25,000 people. ""Standing Bear is a leader like few others – wise, courageous, kind,"" David Grann told Le Monde. ""He has a strong sense of history and a great vision for his people."" These were just some of the qualities displayed by Standing Bear, a former lawyer, impeccably dressed in a suit and tie, during the online interview he gave Le Monde.My name is Geoffrey – spelled like it is in France and England – Standing Bear. Of the Bear clan. I am the elected principal chief of the Osage Nation. A little over 10 years ago, I was an attorney in the small town of Pawhuska – which is our tribal capital – where I still reside with my wife, and we have four children, eight grandchildren. I'm a product of the Roman Catholic school system, high school and grade school, and that is a direct result of the missionary work of the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church among the Osage.We are an oral history-based people – as are most Indigenous people – and so for a time period, so recent in our oral histories, it is very vivid. We have kept these discussions for the most part among ourselves. Some Osage have written books that never received much circulation. The Deaths of Sybil Bolton is one written by an Osage [Dennis McAuliffe Jr., whose grandmother was Osage] about that time period. Another is A Pipe for February, written by an Osage [Charles Red Corn, of the Peace clan of the Osage] about that time period. The story in the book by David Grann and made now into this movie talks about a time that was not talked about very often because it's very depressing. It was just horrible.",/en/culture/
'Van Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise. The Final Months': Revealing the daring boldness of the painter's last work,"    The Musée d'Orsay in Paris is exhibiting the artist's last paintings and drawings, in which a new way of painting is revealed. ","The tenacity of art lovers who endure long queues hoping to catch a glimpse of paintings through dense crowds must be applauded. The exhibition at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris devoted to the last months' Vincent Van Gogh spent in Auvers-sur-Oise (Val-d'Oise) is far from being an exception to this rule: The museum's rooms have been packed from the very first day it opened to the public on October 3. And it is understandably so, as this exceptional exhibition offers the kind of ensemble that we will never see again.Of the 74 paintings and over 50 drawings created by Van Gogh in the two months that led to his suicide on July 29, 1890, the museum brought together some 40 paintings and 20 drawings. The organizers, Nienke Bakker, curator of the Musée Van Gogh in Amsterdam, where the exhibition was previously shown between May and September, and Emmanuel Coquery for the Musée d'Orsay, have managed to borrow – the first time so many of them have been presented in the same place – 11 of the 13 ""double-squares,"" a panoramic format specific to this period of the painter's life.This exhibition was only made possible thanks to the partnership between the two museums. ""Between the two of us, we already had around 15 emblematic works, which is the substantial core of an exhibition,"" explained Coquery. They used this argument to convince other lenders, despite the fragility of the works that resulted from the artist's minimal concern for technique: Painting in oils more than one canvas a day, even ""alla prima"" (a single layer, rather thick in his case), is not without its posthumous drawbacks, the kind that make restorers restless. In spite of this, the loans came from all over the world: Many from the United States, some from Switzerland, others from Scandinavian museums, not to mention those sent by private collectors. There are a few notable absences, in particular the Landscape with a Carriage and a Train, but as it is kept in Moscow's Pushkin Museum, we unfortunately won't be seeing it any time soon.Van Gogh was 37 when he arrived in Auvers-sur-Oise on May 20, 1890. He had just spent a year in the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence (Bouches-du-Rhône). Despite a suicide attempt – he tried to poison himself by eating paint – he was declared cured by the doctor in charge of the institution. The artist sought to return to the North to see Paris again, but he knew his health was fragile. His brother Théo, an art dealer and his main supporter, also realized this. Rather than settle in the capital, Vincent preferred to stay on the fringes and, on Camille Pissarro's advice, chose this small town of just over 2,000 inhabitants, located an hour's train ride from the Gare du Nord. The railway made the town accessible to artists seeking to escape Paris, many of whom had preceded Van Gogh. In addition to Pissarro, Camille Corot, Charles-François Daubigny and Paul Cézanne also set up their easels here. Daubigny even built a country house. Van Gogh was captivated by the region, finding it ""gravely beautiful"" and feeling ""much well-being in the air.""",/en/culture/
Pompidou staff renews strike,"    The center's staff are calling for their jobs to be maintained during the five years of closure, from 2025 to 2030, and for a single location to be found for the redeployment of employees. ","On Thursday, October 19, some 400 employees gathered in the basement of the Centre Pompidou to vote for the renewal of the strike they had started on Monday, October 16. A new general meeting scheduled for Friday will decide on the continuation of the action. The previous large-scale industrial action at the museum, in 2017, lasted 12 days.For the last number of months, staff have been calling for their jobs and status to be maintained during the five years of closure, from 2025 to 2030, as well as their missions when it will reopen. At the heart of their demands, too, is the payment of Sunday and public holiday bonuses. ""Five years of closure is a long time in an employee's career,"" said Philippe Mahé, secretary of the Force Ouvrière labor union, adding that ""the consequences of the building's closure have been underestimated.""A number of different ways of redeploying the Centre Pompidou's activities during the closure have been found. The Bibliothèque Publique d'Information (Public information library) has found a new home in the Lumière building on Avenue des Terroirs-de-France, near Bercy Village. In the spring of 2024, an agreement with the Grand Palais is due to be signed, covering 2,800 square meters of exhibition space.The staff to be transferred there will replace those who, until now, have been outsourced. Other staff will be redeployed to the new facility in Massy, south of Paris, scheduled to open in summer 2026. The 2,500-square-meter space will be used mainly for storage and will host two annual exhibitions based on the collections, as well as a live performance program.For the staff, however, the situation remains unclear, compounded by a heavy workload linked to preparing to move collections and the increased organization of paying exhibitions abroad. Calling for the signature of a protocol meeting all 18 of their demands, the union was heard for four hours on Tuesday by Emmanuel Marcovitch, chief of staff to Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak.At the culture ministry, it has been promised that the jobs of all permanent staff and civil servants will be preserved during the works, with each staff member being offered an activity and a place of work in keeping with his or her individual work level. According to the memorandum of understanding, which Le Monde has been able to consult, the Centre Pompidou is committed to ensuring that the total wage bill covers the salaries of all staff on permanent contracts, civil servants, certain fixed-term contracts and the ""patronage"" jobs required for international projects. Future work schedules should guarantee that existing staff will continue to receive their extra pay for working on Sundays and public holidays. Should this not be the case, management promises that a compensation mechanism will be put in place.",/en/culture/
"In Kyiv, the movies offer residents an escape from war","    Despite the ongoing war, a film festival in the Ukrainian capital sold-out, offering audiences an escape from the harsh realities of everyday life. ","In mid-October, when the weather was still mild in Kyiv, the Zhovten (""October"" in Ukrainian) cinema was transformed into a festival palace. In front of this submarine-shaped jewel of Ukrainian Constructivist architecture, festival-goers at Kyiv Critics' Week exchanged a cigarette or took a selfie with their dog before entering the auditoriums. ""I've got to go, I've got Almodóvar,"" said a latecomer as he ran off. Among the posters for the seventh edition of the festival, which ran from October 12 to 18, was a small announcement: ""The nearest bomb shelter is at the Kontraktova Ploshcha metro station.""Back in 2022, when the capital was plunged into darkness after Russian bombs rained down, Zhovten stood ""like a cathedral,"" the only illuminated spot in the trendy Podil neighborhood, thanks to the humming truck-generator outside the entrance.Despite the war, more spectators attended the event: 6,500 people compared with 5,000 in 2021. ""People literally went toward the light to see the films,"" recalled Denys Ivanov, the event director, outside one of the cafés that contribute to the charm of the neighborhood. ""When the first screening was interrupted by a warning and the second canceled due to a power cut, our team thought it was the end. But the festival continued with packed houses."" Once again this year, the majority of screenings sold out. The capital's inhabitants love to take refuge in front of a big screen.The program included a cross-section of Ukrainian and Polish films, retrospectives and previews of feature-length films screened at Cannes and the Berlinale. ""The war goes on, but questions of gender and equality are always there,"" explained Ivanov. ""We didn't want to anesthetize the public. On the contrary, our aim was to put them in today's context.""At 10 pm on Sunday, October 15, 400 spectators, most of them young, filled the large auditorium to see Forever-Forever, the first film by Ukrainian director Anna Buryachkova, first shown in Venice. Before the auditorium plunged into darkness, the facilitator complied with the current requirements: ""In the event of an air raid, the siren will sound in the auditorium and the screening will be interrupted for a few minutes. Those who wish to do so can head for the shelter and the screening will continue."" War doesn't scare movie buffs.""We wanted to provide viewers with a window into another reality,"" explained festival co-founder Daria Badior, ""to show them that they're not alone. After all, that's what film festivals are all about."" At the microphone, voices, often trembling, shared their experiences between questions. A young man in his 30s admitted he cried through most of the film.",/en/culture/
Paris+ by Art Basel: Contemporary art's shining moment in the French capital,"    Despite economic and international upheavals, the second edition of the Paris+ contemporary art fair opened in an optimistic atmosphere. ","Paris+ by Art Basel, which has replaced the Paris International Contemporary Art Fair (FIAC) for the second year running, welcomed 40,000 visitors in 2022. The director of Paris+, Clément Delépine may have been pleased with this, while still nursing worries about the current edition, which received its invited visitors on Wednesday, October 18 and opened to the public on October 20.Indeed, the fair takes place during troubling times. So much so that Noah Horowitz, head of the four Art Basel fairs (Basel, Miami, Hong Kong and now Paris), felt obliged to send an e-mail to his VIP list deploring the Israel-Hamas war, while reassuring those who may be hesitant by pointing out ""the rigorous security measures implemented by public authorities"" and the similar procedures taken by the fair itself.In order to visit the stands of the 154 galleries – 60 of which are based in France – selected from 700 applications to be installed in the Grand Palais Éphémère on Paris' Champ de Mars, visitors must show their credentials, go through a number of detectors (although access is much smoother than at Basel), and pay an entrance fee of €40 (online purchase mandatory).This is a hefty sum, and is likely to dissuade onlookers: while in the city, access to their galleries is free, at a fair, the dealers prefer well-off customers. However, admission is free to the six events that Paris+ organizes outside its walls: the ""Conversations"" at the Musée Picasso, the works installed in the Tuileries gardens, Place Vendôme, the Petits-Augustins chapel at the Beaux-Arts de Paris, the Palais d'Iéna and in front of the Institut de France.The economic context is also uncertain. ""Start-ups are struggling, real estate is plummeting and shares on the stock market are fragile. For people, art is the only thing left to them in order to escape the slump and invest their money,"" said Parisian art dealer Georges-Philippe Vallois. Judging by the line of limousines parked outside the fair on the day reserved for professionals (and especially large collectors), some of which cost more than many of the works on show, money worries don't concern everyone. Neither the bloody escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, nor the war in Ukraine, nor the real estate crisis in China, nor the rise in interest rates that has put an end to free money, nor rumors of a bedbug infestation have deterred Art Basel's VIPs from the Paris+ fair.Since the niche occupied for 40 years by FIAC (whose first edition was held in 1976) was taken over in 2022 by the Swiss giant Art Basel, globetrotters have been pretending to discover the charms of Paris. Argentine collector Patricia Verges has never missed an edition of FIAC, but  as Art Basel's ""global art patron"", she now looks at the French city in a new light: ""Paris is much more open to the world than it used to be."" ""The capital is having its moment,"" said Delépine.",/en/culture/
Rothko at the Louis Vuitton Foundation: When color throbs,"    The Paris exhibition, spanning from October 18, 2023, to April 2, 2024, faithfully embodies the American painter's approach: The succession of rooms, with low-hanging paintings and excellent lighting, creates a remarkable sensory experience for visitors. ","According to an anecdote told by his daughter, Kate Rothko Prizel, who does not vouch for its accuracy, a conflict arose between Mark Rothko and the curator of New York's Museum of Modern Art, Peter Selz, when the artist had a solo exhibition there in 1961. Rothko, who insisted on reduced lighting, apparently got into the habit of adjusting the electric switches in order to dim the lights whenever he came into the rooms. Selz, as soon as he was informed of the painter's secret meddling, would turn them back up.The anecdote seems quite plausible given Rothko's prickly nature and his dissatisfaction is easy to understand, judging by the photographs that remain of the exhibition. Beams of light are sometimes directed straight at the canvases. Others cast inappropriate shadows. And, clearly, the rooms were too narrow for the 54 paintings selected, meaning that they had to be arranged too close together.The retrospective at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris is designed to avoid all these mistakes. First of all, the exhibition is compactly arranged. The 115 works are spread over four floors in 10 rooms. Works from the 1930s and 1940s, which were still quite small, are logically placed in the lower gallery, with its lower ceilings. Paintings from the following two decades are housed on the other three floors, whose monumental dimensions match their own. They have all the space they need and, on several occasions, one work stands alone on a wall, thus radiating out even further.Where there are series of works, they occupy the longest galleries and are composed either according to a chromatic predominance – the ratio of red, pink and white, for example – or because the colored zones are placed in a similar way – three bands of similar widths or the superimposition of two or three quadrangles. This method of categorization aligns with the inherent logic of the work. At several points, Rothko gives himself what is known in music as a ""theme"" – here a color, there a type of composition – and develops it by modulating variations. This was the case on at least three occasions: in the mid-1950s, with what might be called his ""fauve period""; a little later, with the – by contrast, very dark – canvases of Seagram Murals; and, at the end of his life, in the black-and-gray suite of 1969 and 1970. The visual coherence of the rooms is a testament to the coherence of the artist's creation.A second satisfying element is the heights at which the paintings are hung. Rothko wanted them low, whatever the format. This principle is strictly adhered to so that you are not merely facing a painting, but it's as if you are inside it. This close, almost tactile perception arouses sensations and emotions every time you approach the painted surface. If the word were not so overused today, one might say it's immersion, in a flow or a cloud. Given the intensity of the colors and the sensuality of the red and yellow scales, these sensations are powerful and long-lasting. Hardly any other 20th-century painter has gone so far in the art of absorption, pushed to the point of rapture. It is hardly surprising that, during his travels in Italy, Rothko went to Assisi, Arezzo and Florence each time, to Giotto, Piero della Francesca and Fra Angelico. Nor is it surprising that he wanted to create a chapel, where the viewer is surrounded by canvases.",/en/culture/
Platforms and record labels lobby to block French music streaming tax,"    Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music, YouTube and the record companies are trying to block a tax suggested by President Emmanuel Macron, intended to finance the National Center for Music. ","Lobbying pays off. The streaming music platforms – Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music and also YouTube Music, aided by the major labels (Universal Music, Warner and Sony Music) – have been maneuvering ever since hearing of the threat of a tax to finance the National Center for Music (CNM). They've done this very effectively, since – for the time being – these stakeholders seem to have succeeded in blocking, or at least postponing, measures that would have hindered them.On June 21, President Emmanuel Macron stated that if no agreement emerged within the music industry by September 30, the government would endorse the proposal made by former Paris senator Julien Bargeton (Renaissance, President Macron's party) to levy a tax of 1.75% of sales within France on all music streaming platforms.This is seen as a way to finance the CNM on a permanent basis, to the tune of an additional €20 million a year. Today, only a 3.5% tax, levied on all concert tickets, and a contribution from collective management organizations fund this establishment, which was inaugurated on January 1, 2020, just before the pandemic. According to its missions, the CNM must support musical creation, innovation, the green transition and exportation.But the CNM's fragile revenues are likely to be insufficient. With the organization of the Olympic Games in 2024 alone, the six-month stoppage of major concerts at the Stade de France, Accor Arena and Paris La Défense Arena will result in a ""shortfall of more than €8 million in the CNM's budget,"" warned Olivier Darbois, president of the Syndicat National du Spectacle Musical et des Variétés (Prodiss, the national union for musical and variety shows). In 2023, the CNM will benefit from a budget of €65 million, thanks to the remainder of exceptional subsidies linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. This windfall is likely to fall to €15 million next year if nothing is decided.The entire industry was expecting Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak to announce on Friday, October 13, that a government amendment aimed at taxing the streaming giants would be tabled in the 2024 finance bill. However, this was not the case. The Culture Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. However, several amendments were presented on the subject on October 16, including one by Renaissance MP Fabienne Colboc. The amendment is supported by a group made up of several of her colleagues from the majority party and it defends the principle of a tax. Discussions in the Assemblée Nationale started on October 17.",/en/culture/
Algeria refuses Nobel Prize-winning writer Annie Ernaux's visa request,"    No explanation was given by the Algiers authorities. According to observers, the decision may be linked to a May op-ed co-signed by Ernaux, calling for the release of Algerian journalist Ihsane El Kadi. ","French writer Annie Ernaux, winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize for Literature, will not be attending the Algiers International Book Fair, the 26th edition of which opens on Wednesday, October 25.

The Algerian ambassador in Paris, Said Moussi, personally intervened in this matter, according to the same source.No explanation was given by the authorities in Algiers. According to observers, the decision may be linked to an op-ed co-signed in May by Annie Ernaux calling for the release of Algerian journalist Ihsane El Kadi. The text, published in Le Monde, denounced ""police and judicial harassment of El Kadi, and all of the other prisoners of conscience in Algeria.""Addressing Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, the authors of the letter – which caused quite a stir in the North African country – argued that ""Algeria remains an ideal far greater than the dungeon it is becoming for its boldest journalists and most outspoken dissidents. It is the promised land of the wretched of the earth.""By refusing to grant a visa to the writer, ""the Algerian regime no longer even knows how to identify its friends,"" said an academic, who wished to remain anonymous, noting that Ernaux was also one of the signatories of an ""appeal from the world of culture for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza,"" published in L'Humanité on October 22.The text, which condemns ""war crimes, those of Hamas and those of the Israeli government,"" as well as ""oppression and racism, in all [its] forms,"" has been well received in Algeria, where the position of the French authorities, perceived as too favorable to Israel, is the subject of severe criticism.""You can't close the door on a friend in these grave times of dramatic cultural confrontation when every country is counting on its friends and allies to make its voice heard,"" wrote journalist Ghania Mouffok on her Facebook page. ""By not receiving Annie Ernaux,"" she continued, ""Algeria is providing weapons to fight against what it itself defends, from the depths of our history, which is anti-colonial and in favor of an equitable sharing of resources, from Palestine, the Western Sahara, and the Sahel to Muslim women whose right to practice their faith with or without a hijab is insulted.""",/en/culture/
Britney Spears reveals the woman within,"    'The Woman in Me,' the pop star's autobiography, hit bookstores worldwide on Tuesday, October 24. It sheds light on her hypersexualized adolescence, pressure to abort and guardianship by her father – reflecting modern American society. ","A simultaneous release in 26 countries, pre-orders topping online sales sites, a monumental presence in bookshops worldwide (100,000 copies in France), with an estimated $15 million in sales (around €14 million), leaks to the press... The Woman in Me, available since Tuesday, October 24, is one of the publishing events of 2023.And with good reason, since the woman in question, the book's author, is one of the world's most famous stars: Britney Spears. A star revealing herself is nothing new under the entertainment sun, you might say. And yet.If The Woman in Me – written with an unnamed ghostwriter – is one of the major releases of the year for English publishing giant Simon & Schuster. If the American media fought hard to obtain an exclusive interview with the singer – with the weekly People winning by a wide margin – it's because Spears is not a star like the others. ""There's a real sense of expectation around this book,"" pointed out Véronique Cardi, general manager of JC Lattès Editions, which is publishing the French version, ""from fans, of course, but also from all those who see her as an icon of our times.""Let's recap. Spears, the daughter of a middle-class family from the southern United States, has become one of the most listened-to singers on the planet in the space of 25 years. She's also been the talk of the town. For her syrupy lyrics, with their sexual allusions, for her marriages, her revealing outfits, a few scandals... She has often shocked mainstream America. In this respect, Spears has followed a path notably blazed by Madonna. But the woman who grew up in Kentwood, Louisiana, has also fueled the legal chronicle.In 2008, following suspicions of a mental disorder, the singer was placed under guardianship. The management of her day-to-day life, from finances to relationships, fell into the hands of her father, James Parnell Spears. A fleet of lawyers, accountants and psychologists monitored her every move.On social media, her fans, judging the case as excessive, launched the #FreeBritney movement. In autumn 2020, the singer decided to seek justice. In early 2021, a documentary produced by the New York Times, Framing Britney Spears, revealed that she was indeed a victim of this guardianship and under the influence of her father and his entourage. The much-discussed trial resulted in the guardianship being lifted at the end of 2021.This, of course, is the very essence of an autobiography: The Woman in Me revisits key moments in its author's life. ""But this word is free, at last!"" said Cardi. There are, of course, the descriptions of a childhood spent dreaming of becoming ""a star like Madonna, Dolly Parton or Whitney Houston,"" her debut, at the age of eight, on The Mickey Mouse Club show, and her first concerts in shopping malls.",/en/culture/
"Bob Dylan, the eternal enigma",Investigation,"On May 10, 2022, the town of Tulsa, Oklahoma, crossed by Route 66, became the Louvre for Bob Dylan fans. On that day, the Bob Dylan Center opened its doors, the third stop on a pilgrimage that includes Hibbing, Minnesota, where the man born Robert Zimmerman in 1941 grew up, and Greenwich Village, the bohemian New York neighborhood from which he rose to fame. Gospel and soul singer Mavis Staples (a childhood sweetheart) and two disciples, Elvis Costello and Patti Smith, attended the center's inauguration. Once again, Dylan lived up to his elusive reputation.The Tulsa museum is in good company, just 50 meters from the one dedicated to folksinger Woody Guthrie (1912-1967). The man whose guitar bore the slogan ""This machine kills fascists"" was a hero whom Dylan, then unknown, visited in the hospital on his arrival in New York in 1961. Before selling his copyrights to Universal in 2020, and his recording rights to rival Sony – two transactions estimated at more than $500 million combined – Dylan had already ceded his archives in 2016 to the foundation of billionaire George Kaiser, owner of the Woody Guthrie Center, which decided to open the Bob Dylan Center. On public display for the first time, this collection has not failed to attract Dylan fans and support their favorite activity: interpreting the sphinx's lyrics.For, even more than his peers elevated to the rank of poet (Leonard Cohen, Lou Reed, Jim Morrison or Patti Smith), his words, spread over more than 600 songs, are methodically scrutinized, analyzed and interpreted by legions of researchers. Dylanologists examine every word, just as others decode hieroglyphics. ""His refusal to dissect and explain his body of work, or himself, has made Dylan and his work especially enigmatic and open to interpretation,"" explained archivist Parker Fishel, curator of the exhibition at the Bob Dylan Center. ""People continue to write about Dylan because there is no Rosetta Stone.""Mark Davidson, director of the Bob Dylan Center and the Woody Guthrie Center, noted that the temple of Dylanology has plenty to keep enthusiasts busy. It brings together ""more than 100,000 items spanning Dylan's career, including handwritten manuscripts, notebooks and correspondence; films, videos, photographs and artwork; memorabilia and ephemera; personal documents and effects; unreleased studio and concert recordings; musical instruments; and many other elements.""It differs from other museums dedicated to singers, whose collections often include only guitars and stage outfits, in its literary abundance: ""One can see that Dylan worked on whatever he had at hand, whether it was the massive amount of materials he generated on his typewriter in the mid-1960s or the countless hotel notepads that he used to craft songs from the 1980s onward while he was constantly touring.""",/en/culture/
The distress of Gazan artists living in France,"    French-Palestinian artists who arrived in France in the early 2000s are anxiously seeking news of their loved ones who stayed in the Gaza Strip, and call out their adopted country for having 'zero empathy' for civilians affected by Israel's bombardments. ","On Hani Zurob's worktable, there was a roll of adhesive tape, two cutters, a kitchen blowtorch, a magnifying glass, paintbrushes and a laptop connected to the Al-Jazeera news channel's live feed.Since the start of the fifth Gaza war on October 7, in retaliation for the bloodbath caused by Hamas in southern Israel, the visual artist who is originally from the Palestinian coastal enclave but has lived in France for almost 20 years, has been unable to take his eyes off the images of his homeland. The small ground-floor studio apartment he uses as an art studio in the 14th arrondissement of Paris echoed with the sound of Israeli bombardments, the cries of the grief-stricken population and the horrified comments of the Qatari channel's correspondents.Zurob, aged 47, with his graying beard and coal-black eyes, paid particular attention to the banner at the bottom of the Al-Jazeera screen, which lists the day's victims, petrified at the thought of seeing a family member's name. They live in Rafah, in the south of the Gaza Strip. ""I haven't had any news for 40 hours now,"" he said flatly. ""The last sign of life was a text message from my niece. I'm like a zombie. I've never felt so alone in my life.""By the 19th day of the war, the shelling of the Gaza Strip had caused more than 6,500 deaths, the vast majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Gazan health ministry, which is run by Hamas. Eighty-one Palestinians were also killed by Israeli settlers and soldiers in the West Bank. The Hamas offensive against adjacent areas in Gaza left 1,400 people dead, again mostly civilians, according to the Israeli authorities.At the other end of Paris, in the 18th arrondissement, another ground-floor studio was home to another Gazan artist, 56-year-old Taysir Batniji. Here too, dramatic images from Al-Jazeera, broadcast on a computer screen, took over the entire space, despite being cluttered with creative tools, such as canvases, pencils, photos and paint pots. ""I know the Gaza sky by heart; its colors, its light,"" said Batniji. ""It's the one you see in the Al-Jazeera correspondents' live broadcasts, shot from the roof of a building. But this sky is the only reference point I have left. When the camera comes back down to the ground, I don't recognize anything anymore, it's too destroyed.""Zurob and Batniji are part of the micro-community of Gazan creators who started to settle in France in the early 2000s following in the footsteps of painter Samir Salameh, who died in 2018 and who split his time between Ramallah and Sarthe. The small troupe also includes Paris-based painters Shadi Alzaqzouq and May Murad, opera composer Moneim Adwan, who lives in Aix-en-Provence, Marseille-based filmmakers Arab and Tarzan Nasser, and painter Mohammed Joha, who also lives in Marseille.",/en/culture/
"Saw X: The bloody return of John Kramer, virtuoso of the human barbecue","    The saga's tenth installment stays true to its agenda, this time with a series of torture scenes directed against a fake medical team who exploit distressed patients. ","If it had ended with a movie named Saw 6 (homonymous with saucisse, sausage in French, 2009), the franchise would have said its last word on its philosophy: Human barbecuing, the dismemberment of bodily integrity, the pleasure of both showing and seeing suffering inflicted – in short, the spectacle of sadism in its most barbarous form, even under fictional license. But it was not to be. The saga has been claiming victims for 20 years now, in the wake of James Wan's first feature-length film (Saw, 2004), which laid the foundations for this sub-genre of horror films, aptly named torture porn. Based on a concept whose strength lay in its simplicity – a series of torture scenes inflicted by a psychopath on a small group of people he has trapped – it was an instant success that quickly elevated the saga to horror film nirvana.As a quick reminder, John Kramer, aka Jigsaw, has a fatal brain tumor and uses the time he has left to discipline sinners through trials they have little chance to escape. A kind of Puritan, in short, who inflicts on his victims abuses far more terrifying than the faults he charges them with. Kramer dies in the third installment, but other protagonists carry on the tradition. This tenth volume, however, takes us back to the beginning of the saga, somewhere between the first and second films, by bringing back two of its inaugural characters, John Kramer (Tobin Bell) and Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith), one of his first victims who, enchanted by the experience, ends up becoming his disciple.The festivities of this tenth episode take place in Mexico City and under the ominous invocation of the Aztec gods. Kramer comes here after meeting one of the members of his discussion group for stage 4 pancreatic cancer patients who miraculously seems to be in total remission. He gives him the address of a Norwegian doctor, Dr. Pederson, who came up with a revolutionary treatment that forces him into hiding because of the danger it represents for pharmaceutical companies. Treated by the doctor's daughter with the help of the best professionals in the field, Kramer is operated on in a wealthy hacienda before discovering that the whole affair is a scam preying on distressed patients.This, of course, is where the festivities begin: Kramer, assisted by Amanda, kidnaps the pseudo-medical team that has swindled him and inflicts the usual ""game,"" consisting of lethal contraptions that force victims to severely self-mutilate within a very limited timeframe if they want to survive. On today's menu: legs cut off with saws, ankles blown off with mallets, flesh carved with razors, skulls opened, cerebellum punctured, intestines eviscerated, faces burned with rays, heads sliced off. Greenish atmosphere, disused industrial buildings, steel instruments. While the tricks occasionally recall sardonic grand-guignol humor, the film gets mired in an overarching sense of discomfort.",/en/culture/
Brian Eno gives a rare and brief Paris concert,"    The English musician, composer and producer, known for his work with David Bowie and U2, had not performed in France since 1975. ","It's hard to imagine that this smooth-headed Englishman in his 70s was such an eye-catcher during his brief stint (1971-1973) with Roxy Music. It was the time of triumphant glam rock, and Brian Eno, behind his synthesizer, stole the show from singer Bryan Ferry, with his long hair, made-up eyes, furs and feathers. After his departure, the short-lived rock star became a fascinating explorer of sound, with a complete absence of commercial consideration, besides for his musical clients.Although the general public may be familiar with Eno's name, it's usually thanks to his many collaborations as producer and composer, for David Bowie (the so-called ""Berlin trilogy""), Talking Heads, U2 at its best (the albums The Joshua Tree, in 1987, and Achtung Baby, in 1991) or Coldplay, among others.To say the least, Brian Eno's stage appearances have been few and far between. The concert he gave at La Seine Musicale, Boulogne-Billancourt (west of Paris), on Thursday, October 26, was his first in France since... 1975, when he came to the Paris Olympia in the company of guitarist Robert Fripp, the mastermind of King Crimson. He may have made a few scattered appearances, but he hadn't embarked on a tour since Roxy Music. This belated excursion includes only a handful of dates at venues such as La Fenice in Venice and the Berlin Philharmonic. Places where art music is played.The artist who kept the audience waiting, enveloped in Zen-like softness, reminded us of what we owe him. With his series of four albums, starting with Music for Airports in 1978, Eno is credited as the inventor of ambient music, a genre that was destined to become a category of electro, even if its origins go back to the ""furniture music"" conceptualized by Erik Satie as early as 1917. The short set (80 minutes) was not in this vein, as the musician was seized by the urge to sing. This would appear to be his Achilles' heel, despite the technical manipulations and the support of soprano Melanie Pappenheim. To kick things off, there were four tracks from The Ship (2016), a modern allegory based on the sinking of the Titanic.To (re)discover it, Eno employed a young orchestra, the Baltic Sea Philharmonic, conducted by Kristjan Järvi. The instrumentalists entered one by one, taking center stage and moving freely with their conductor. There is no score for this work composed by a ""non-musician,"" as Eno defines himself. The work focuses on timbres, flat tones and volume when the brass rumbles. In the end, a melody emerged, but it was Lou Reed who was responsible for it, with a cover of ""I'm Set Free"" (1969) by The Velvet Underground. Respectful, if not enthusiastic, applause followed.",/en/culture/
Matthew Perry fans pay tribute at iconic NYC 'Friends' building,"    After the death on Saturday of the actor who played Chandler Bing in the hit sitcom, fans traveled to the building on the corner of Bedford Street and Grove Street, which served as the exterior shot of the characters' apartments throughout the show's 10 seasons. ","Matthew Perry was always their friend, too.That was the feeling among fans of the American actor, known for his iconic role as Chandler Bing on the hit sitcom ""Friends,"" as they gathered Sunday outside the New York apartment building used in the show's filming. ""I grew up watching him,"" said Taylor Lanthier, 26, who was among those making the pilgrimage, where many left flowers and handwritten letters in Perry's memory.The 54-year-old was found dead Saturday, October 28, – too soon for many fans, in a testament to the staying power of ""Friends,"" which aired from 1994 to 2004 and continues to live on for viewers across generations in reruns and on streaming services.The light rain wasn't enough to keep visitors from paying their respects on the instantly recognizable street corner in the trendy West Village neighborhood where the six-story building sits, adorned in classic New York style with a brick facade and metal fire escapes. ""I'm sure you could find stories of people who move to New York because of the show 'Friends,'"" said Chris Triebel, 39, who leads tours focusing on TV shows and movies filmed in the city.And part of that would be due to Perry's Chandler, himself a sarcastic 20-something who long resisted growing up. ""He's had a very impactful role in my life and always has given me tons of laughs, and it's sad to hear about his passing,"" said Lanthier, who recently graduated law school in Vancouver. ""Chandler is a funny guy. He's a loving guy. He's someone who's very dedicated to his friends,"" she added. ""And that's what I think Matthew was as well.""""I just wanted to pay my respects,"" she said, having come with a yellow rose that she placed next to a note left by another passerby. It read: ""Thank you for all the laughs.""Like much of American pop culture, the show had been reevaluated by some in recent years, criticized for its lack of diversity or the simple, sanitized reality it presented. It was also filmed in California, with the building at 90 Bedford Street used for establishing shots.Yet none of that stopped the West Village neighborhood from becoming a place of interest for fans across generations, who have been making the trek to the building for years -- even if Central Perk, the New York coffee shop where the friends spent so much time, was also a figment of the screenwriters' imagination.""It's just a lighthearted show,"" said Eva, a 16-year-old high school student who lives nearby. ""It was something that I watched when I was sad or just if I wanted a nice laugh.""Triebel, the tour guide, had already planned a stop outside the building before Perry's death, though the news had given the visit a somber air. ""He's one who's definitely gone too soon,"" he said. ""I think there was a lot more that he could have done.""",/en/culture/
Cinemed film festival provides counterprogramming to war in the Middle East,"    The shadow of the conflict between Israel and Hamas hangs over the Mediterranean film festival in Montpellier, which invites Palestinians and Israelis alike to present their work. ","Almost everything was ready. The program was finalized, and invitations sent out to some 250 professionals – filmmakers, actors and producers – from all over the Mediterranean basin. There were just a few details to be ironed out, as is the case before every edition of Cinemed, the festival which, for 45 years in Montpellier, has been showcasing the Mediterranean powder keg, its solidarities and its disparities.And then terror struck in the early hours of October 7, first in Israel, then in Palestine. Film events were canceled one after the other, in Egypt, Qatar and Tunisia. Cinemed teams thought hard, as Israeli and Palestinian guests dropped out. Some preferred to look after their loved ones. Others mourned their loss. Israeli filmmaker Shaylee Atary, whose short film Single Light was selected, lost her husband, Yahav Winner. Also a filmmaker, he was killed by a Hamas terrorist while defending their home on the Kfar Aza kibbutz. Wasn't still holding the festival, scheduled from October 20 to 28, derisory, even indecent?""We hesitated. Then we said to ourselves, 'If we don't show these works, who will?'"" said director Christophe Leparc, justifying his decision to go ahead in spite of everything. On opening night, two video messages were broadcast. The first was sent by Israeli filmmaker Dani Rosenberg, 44, whose second feature, The Vanishing Soldier, is in competition. The second featured a well-known figure in Palestinian cinema, the actor and director Mohammad Bakri, 69, to whom a retrospective is dedicated, together with one of his sons, the actor Saleh Bakri, 46.From one video to the next, the faces betrayed the same dejection. Rosenberg stayed with his family in Tel Aviv. On October 7, he had just landed in South Korea to attend the Busan International Film Festival. The on-the-spot screening of The Vanishing Soldier, which follows the escape of an Israeli soldier fleeing Gaza to join his lover in Tel Aviv, was ""a frightening experience,"" he said, given the film's resonance with current events. ""We shot on the Gaza border, and the soldier character, Shlomi [Ido Tako], arrives in Israel through the Zikim base, one of the points through which Hamas entered Israel, on October 7. Then Shlomi passes through a village that was attacked. It's as if my film was crashing into the walls of reality.""Rosenberg is thinking of the ""Palestinian victims, who should not have to pay the price of this war."" He didn't mince his words against the current Israeli leadership: ""Freeing the hostages is not their priority, they only talk about revenge. This is a serious mistake. They strengthened Hamas at the expense of Fatah to divide the Palestinians and kill the dream of a two-state solution. They didn't protect us during the October 7 attacks."" The filmmaker is still reeling from the footage on social media. ""Hamas broadcast videos of burnt houses, pregnant women with open stomachs and decapitated children. It's like an attack on the mind."" He teaches cinema in Jerusalem and feels helpless in the face of this material, which is at the heart of his profession. ""We're faced with an overflow of images, which prevents us from understanding what's happening.""",/en/culture/
New museum honors the French language in history-rich château,"    The highly political Cité Internationale de la Langue Française, on Emmanuel Macron's agenda since 2017, was inaugurated on October 30 in the restored former home of King François I. ","The clatter of jackhammers had died down. On the grounds of the Château de Villers-Cotterêts (Aisne, northern France) – where King François I signed an order in 1539 imposing the use of French in judicial and administrative acts, which were previously drafted in Latin – the coming and going of workers had stopped and the fine dust covering the floors had been cleaned. After four years of work, temporary buildings and scaffolding had been dismantled. Emmanuel Macron's promise, announced in March 2017 during his first presidential campaign, had taken shape: The Cité Internationale de la Langue Française (""International City of the French Language"") was inaugurated by the president on Monday, October 30, at 10 am, before it opens on November 1.The prestigious facility, which justifies a total budget of €211 million, is not limited to the 1,600 square meter interactive tour of the French language, including its expansion and enrichment thanks to all of the French-speaking world. It provides space for local associations (fencing club, public writers' office, etc.); residencies for French-speaking authors; and, in its vast auditorium, current forms such as rap, slam and one-person shows. The aim is to attract museumgoers from a wide range of backgrounds: French-speaking foreigners and people from the region, museum regulars and less accustomed visitors.According to Marie Lavandier, who took over from Philippe Bélaval as president of the Centre des Monuments Nationaux (CMN, National Monuments Center) in May, the Cité is ""more than a monument, more than a park, more than a national project."" Catering to multiple uses, it aims to translate the president's vision of a cultural bond linking the deindustrialized Picardy region to the capital and the vast French-speaking world to mainland France. ""For the president, language is the foundation of our imagination, our permanence and our commonality. It is an instrument in the fight against decivilization,"" said a member of Macron's entourage.This grand vision was violently shattered on October 13 when Dominique Bernard, a French teacher, was brutally murdered in Arras. His October 19 funeral, which Macron attended, postponed the inauguration of the Cité, which had been scheduled for the same day. ""We can't ignore it,"" Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak told Le Monde. ""The language, taught by passionate teachers all over the country, is what unites us, what makes us a nation. The more uptight and inward-looking we become, the more we need spaces for dialogue, sensitive awakenings and encounters like this one."" She added, ""French is also the language of humor, of impertinence, of irony. This has been on our minds ever since the attack on Charlie Hebdo.""",/en/culture/

"In Barcelona, censored art now has its own museum","    Since 2018, Catalan collector Tatxo Benet has purchased almost 200 artworks from around the world that were subjected to censorship for one reason or another. Around 40 of these are on display in his Museum of Forbidden Art, which opened on October 26. ","The man welcoming visitors is wearing a grey raincoat, dark glasses and a thin mustache and is seated on a chair with his hands on his knees – a crude cardboard mannequin. This ""spectator of spectators"" sets the tone for the Museum of Forbidden Art, which opened its doors in Barcelona on Thursday, October 26. Representing both an agent of the political police and a Francoist censor, he was created by Equipo Cronica. In 1972, this group of Valencian artists placed around a hundred of them in the auditoriums, exhibition halls and concert halls of the Rencontres de Pamplona to remind national and international artists and visitors that Spain was still subject to the moral, social and political control of an authoritarian regime. One of these mannequins is now exhibited in the museum's lobby, which was designed by the Catalan collector and businessman Tatxo Benet as a refuge for creative freedom from censors of all kinds.Within the walls of Casa Garriga Nogues, a vast modernist palace built in 1900, some 40 works by Spanish and international artists, most of them contemporary, have been brought together. There's the Lego portrait of Filippo Strozzi (the son of one of Florence's most powerful families during the Renaissance), created by the Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei despite the Danish firm's refusal to supply him with small bricks for his political works. Or the statue of Christ as Ronald McDonald entitled McJesus by the Finnish artist Jani Leinonen, who was attacked with smoke grenades by Christian opponents in Israel's Haifa Museum of Art. And finally, the erotic drawings in Pablo Picasso's 347 series and the scenes of misery and torture depicted in Francisco de Goya's Caprichos. What the works on display have in common is that they were subjected to political, religious or commercial censorship, social pressure and even attacks.One of them is the photomontage Con Flores a Maria (2018) by the Spanish artist Charo Corrales, in which she appears as the Virgin Mary, gazing up at the sky, her hand in her crotch. The canvas was slashed by the knife of a visitor at an exhibition in Cordoba. ""I'd like this museum to become a center for reflection on freedom of expression and to help draw an atlas of censorship,"" said Benet, a 66-year-old man with messy hair dressed in a gray suit.It was in February 2018 that this former journalist, who co-founded the multimedia group Mediapro and has been collecting contemporary art for some 20 years already, began his collection of censored works by accident. That year, he bought Santiago Sierra's Political Prisoners in Contemporary Spain at Madrid's contemporary art fair Arco. The title of this set of 24 photographs of individuals whose faces have been pixilated and who had been convicted of assaulting police officers, apology for terrorism or sedition, in the case of the Catalan independence leaders behind the illegal referendum of October 2017, caused such a scandal that it was withdrawn from the fair at the request of the director of the IFEMA exhibition center.",/en/culture/
Louvre Abu Dhabi: A  twist in the antiquities trafficking case?,"    German art dealer Serop Simonian, who has been suspected of selling objects of dubious provenance to the museum, was extradited to France in mid-September. ","New light should soon be shed on the ongoing case of antique objects of illicit provenance purchased by the Louvre Abu Dhabi, which has already led to the 2022 indictment of the Louvre's former president, Jean-Luc Martinez, as well as of Jean-François Charnier, the former scientific director of Agence France Muséums, which was set up to steer the Louvre Abu Dhabi project. According to Le Monde, Serop Simonian, one of the alleged masterminds behind the case, was extradited from Hamburg to France in mid-September. He has been charged with fraud and money laundering, and is now in prison.Born in Cairo in 1942, this naturalized German art dealer officially runs a coin-collecting business, Dionysos Antike Münzen und Antiquitäten (""Dionysus Ancient Coins and Antiquities""). According to investigators from France's Office Central de Lutte Contre le Trafic de Biens Culturels (Central Office for Combating the Trafficking of Cultural Goods, OCBC), the octogenarian dealer is in possession of no fewer than 25,000 antiquities stored in Europe and the Middle East.The Simonian family was behind the 2017 sale of the sarcophagus of the priest Nedjemankh, which New York's Metropolitan Museum had to return to Cairo in 2019, following an American police investigation. From 2014 to 2018, the Simonian family sold seven objects of problematic provenance to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, for the sum of €50 million. All these objects were sold through the intermediation of Lebanese-German art dealer, Roben Dib, who represented the Simonians. He was extradited to France in March 2022 and indicted for organized fraud.According to  Le Quotidien de l'art, Simonian has maintained that he is innocent, claiming that the antiques came from his siblings, antique dealers originally from Cairo, and were legitimately exported to Germany in the 1970s. Contacted on several occasions, his lawyer, Christophe Ingrain, did not respond to our requests.At the same time, a shadow is also being cast over Charnier, who intends to appeal his indictment before the highest French court, on Tuesday, November 14, pleading a lack of serious and corroborating evidence. From 2013 to 2018, the archaeologist played a leading role in managing six of the seven cases of acquisitions of artifacts destined for the Louvre Abu Dhabi.According to information from the investigation obtained by Le Monde, police found evidence of favors on a seized computer belonging to Hicham Aboutaam, an antiquities dealer with an unsavory reputation. Alongside his brother Ali, he co-founded the Swiss gallery Phoenix Ancient Art. The two brothers, who exhibit at international fairs and sell to some of the world's greatest museums, including the Louvre Abu Dhabi, have been under investigation for a long time. In December 2003, Hicham Aboutaam was arrested in the United States for attempting to illegally import an object looted in Iran.",/en/culture/
Asian immigration beyond stereotypes on display in Paris,"    The National Museum of the History of Immigration exhibition 'East and Southeast Asian Immigration since 1860,' shows 150 years of evolution in the representation of Asian populations in France. ","Despite collectively representing an estimated 6% of immigrants in France, Asian populations are barely mentioned in the permanent exhibition of the Musée National de l'Histoire de l'Immigration (National Museum of the History of Immigration) since it reopened in June, following major renovations. This omission is addressed by a new exhibition, entitled ""East and Southeast Asian Immigration since 1860,"" presented on the first floor of the Palais de la Porte-Dorée in Paris, which houses the museum.The exhibition comprises photos, archival documents, maps, written and filmed testimonies, artworks and objects – some of which were collected through a call to individuals and associations. Through these, its two curators, Simeng Wang, a sociologist, and Emilie Gandon, the head of the Histoire du Musée (""History of the Museum"") collection, shine new light on the historical, social, cultural and political trajectories of people who arrived in France from Japan, China, Vietnam, Korea, Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines.""A scope chosen because of the influence – particularly the cultural influence – of ancient China on the whole region, the inter-regional migratory flows between these different countries and, finally, the relatively similar process of racialization experienced in France by people from this part of Asia,"" Wang explained.Indeed, it was this last point, and the stereotypes generally applied to these populations, that triggered the desire to create this exhibition, according to Constance Rivière, director general of the Palais de la Porte-Dorée. ""In 2020, the arrival of Covid-19, originally from China, exacerbated discriminatory attitudes towards the Asian community, a form of racism that dare not speak its name,"" she said. Numerous testimonies at the time reported hate speech, threats and an overall climate of hostility towards those perceived as Asian nationals, with Le Courrier Picard, a French newspaper, even going so far as to run a front-page headline reading ""Yellow Alert.""The exhibition unfolds chronologically, beginning with the 1860s and the rise of French imperialism in the Far East under the Second French Empire (1852-1870, under Napoleon III). It was a period that saw the arrival in Paris of many officials and diplomats tasked with renegotiating the terms of French occupation – an effort that would prove futile. We discover their portraits in a series of black-and-white photos – curiously shot at the Natural History Museum – in which they pose in their resplendent outfits. In their wake came the first wave of migrants, mainly workers who were destined to replace slave labor on colonial plantations.",/en/culture/

The attosecond is currently the smallest measurable unit of time (one billionth of a billionth of a second).L'Huillier had already won the prestigious Wolf Prize in 2022, sometimes a precursor to the Nobel Prize, along with Krausz and Canadian physicist Paul Corkum.Before L'Huillier, only four women had won the Nobel Prize in Physics since it was first given out in 1901: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018) and Andrea Ghez (2020).Prior to Tuesday's announcement, three of the last six Nobel Prizes in Physics were awarded to physicists working ""in astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology,"" noted Physics World magazine, which considered it unlikely that the work associated with the discoveries of the James Webb Space Telescope would be rewarded this year.Last year, the Swedish Academy awarded the prize to Alain Aspect (French), John Clauser (American) and Anton Zeilinger (Austrian), pioneers of the revolutionary mechanisms of quantum physics.",/en/science/
US TV provider given first-ever space debris fine,"    The Federal Communications Commission came down on Dish for 'failure to properly deorbit' a satellite called EchoStar-7, in orbit since 2002. ","US authorities have issued a ""breakthrough"" first-ever fine over space debris, officials said on Tuesday, October 3, slapping a $150,000 penalty on a TV company that failed to properly dispose of a satellite.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) came down on Dish for ""failure to properly deorbit"" a satellite called EchoStar-7, in orbit since 2002.""This marks a first in space debris enforcement by the Commission, which has stepped up its satellite policy efforts,"" the FCC, which authorizes space-based telecom services, said in a statement.As the geostationary satellite came to the end of its operational life, Dish had moved it to an altitude lower than the two parties had agreed on, where it ""could pose orbital debris concerns,"" the FCC said. The commission said Dish pledged in 2012 to elevate the satellite to 300 kilometers above its operational arc. But with fuel running low, it retired the satellite at an altitude just over 120 km above the original arc.""As satellite operations become more prevalent and the space economy accelerates, we must be certain that operators comply with their commitments,"" said the FCC enforcement bureau chief Loyaan A. Egal. ""This is a breakthrough settlement, making very clear the FCC has strong enforcement authority and capability to enforce its vitally important space debris rules.""The FCC said: ""The settlement includes an admission of liability from the company and an agreement to adhere to a compliance plan and pay a penalty of $150,000.""Dish did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The European Space Agency estimates that around 1 million pieces of debris larger than a centimeter – big enough to ""disable a spacecraft"" – are in Earth's orbit.They are already causing problems, from a near-miss in January last year involving a Chinese satellite, to a 5-millimeter hole knocked into a robotic arm on the International Space Station in 2021. With satellites now crucial for GPS, broadband and banking data, collisions pose significant risks on Earth.",/en/science/
Nobel Prize for Physics honors tiny light pulses that capture changes in atoms,"    French-Swedish Anne L'Huillier, Frenchman Pierre Agostini and Austro-Hungarian Ferenc Krausz were honored for their work in observing electronic processes on the smallest possible time scale. ","It was the quickest Nobel Prize ever! On Tuesday October 3, the Swedish Academy celebrated the ""attosecond"" – a very, very short time – by awarding the Nobel Prize for Physics to French-Swedish Anne L'Huillier, Frenchman Pierre Agostini and Austro-Hungarian Ferenc Krausz. Attosecond? The blink of an eye might be fleeting, but it is still 1,000,000,000,000,000 times longer than a hundred attoseconds. In one attosecond, light travels three angstroms, the typical size of an atom.One attosecond is equal to exactly 10-18 seconds. It is 1,000 times shorter than another unit that was previously rewarded by the Nobel jury, in 1999, but in chemistry section: the femtosecond.This year's Nobel Prize in Physics does not celebrate a new word, of course, but the pioneers who brought it to life in the form of ultraviolet flashes of light lasting a few hundred attoseconds. It took more than 10 years of work and effort for the winners to reach this point.L'Huillier, 65, a professor at Lund University in Sweden, became the fifth French physicist to win this award, the 16th Nobel medal for France. And Agostini, born in 1941, former researcher at the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and now at Ohio State University, won the 17th. The French pair shared the prize equally with Krausz, 61, professor at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, near Munich (Germany).Missing from the list was Canadian Paul Corkum, soon to be 80, of the University of Ottawa, who was awarded the Wolf Prize in 2022, along with L'Huillier and Krausz. This prize is often considered to be a placeholder for the Nobel Prize. The three physicists' names were circulating so intensely that last year, the University of Ottawa anticipated the Nobel jury's announcement by prematurely posting a winning press release, which remained online for more than a few attoseconds.These scientists have each contributed to equipping chemists and physicists with ultra-fast cameras to film processes that are otherwise invisible because they are far too brief to be captured. Using lasers with pulses lasting just a few femtoseconds, chemists were able to see chemical bonds being broken for the first time. As in the stroboscopic effect, where scenes appear to freeze under the effect of the succession of flashes. Here, the scenes are not nightclub dancers, but equally stirring objects, on infinitely smaller scales: the electrons at the heart of molecules, which are responsible for chemical bonds.Attoseconds reveal an even more profound and agitated world. We see electrons tearing themselves away from a nucleus, jumping from one atom to another, taking on bizarre shapes in space, or moving from one internal energy state to another, like climbers on a ladder.",/en/science/
Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to three scientists for their work on tiny quantum dots,"    After the prize was unexpectedly leaked early on Wednesday morning, the chemistry prize was announced for US-based scientists Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov for their work on semiconductor nanocrystals known as quantum dots. ","Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday, October 4, for their work on tiny quantum dots. Moungi Bawendi, of MIT, Louis Brus, of Columbia University, and Alexei Ekimov, of Nanocrystals Technology Inc., were honored for their work with the tiny particles that are just a few atoms in diameter and whose electrons have constrained movement. This affects how they absorb and release visible light, allowing for very bright colors. They are used in many electronics, like LED displays.""These tiny particles have unique properties and now spread their light from television screens and LED lamps. They catalyze chemical reactions and their clear light can illuminate tumor tissue for a surgeon,"" according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which announced the award in Stockholm.In a highly unusual turn of events, Swedish media reported the names of the winners before the prize was announced. The academy did not comment on the leaked names before the announcement.The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the physics, chemistry and economics prizes, asks for nominations a year in advance from thousands of university professors and other scholars around the world.A committee for each prize then discusses candidates in a series of meetings throughout the year. At the end of the process, the committee presents one or more proposals to the full academy for a vote. The deliberations, including the names of nominees other than the winners, are kept confidential for 50 years.Last year, Americans Carolyn R. Bertozzi and K. Barry Sharpless, and Danish scientist Morten Meldal were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for developing a way of "" snapping molecules together"" that can be used to explore cells, map DNA and design drugs that can target diseases such as cancer more precisely.The Nobel Foundation raised the prize money by 10% this year to 11 million kronor (about $1 million). In addition to the money, winners receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma when they collect their Nobel Prizes at the award ceremonies in December.",/en/science/
Nobel Prize in Chemistry announcement disrupted by a leak,"    Four hours before the official announcement on Wednesday, a press release from the Royal Academy of Sciences revealing the winners was sent out in error. ","The Nobel Prize is a well-oiled machine. Everything is programmed down to the last detail, starting with the email sent to journalists at the beginning of September inviting them to the official announcement. The prize distribution schedule is also meticulously structured, with one award bestowed each day during the first week of October, starting with medicine, followed by physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and concluding with economics, all leading up to the ceremony on December 10.But on the morning of Wednesday, October 4, a glitch derailed everything. While the live presentation of the winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was scheduled for 11:45 am from the Royal Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, Swedish newsrooms began to panic a little after 7:30 am. Several journalists had just received a press release announcing that the prize had been awarded to Moungi Bawendi (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Louis Brus (Columbia University) and Alexei Ekimov (Nanocrystals Technology Inc.), ""for the development and synthesis of quantum dots.""While taking the precaution of using the conditional tense, the kingdom's media published the names of the winners a few moments later. For there was no room for doubt – the press release had indeed come from the Royal Academy of Sciences, a fact confirmed by several of its members, while assuring them that the official decision would only be taken in the morning, at a meeting of the committee responsible for awarding the prize.For a little over four hours, the situation was unclear, before geneticist Hans Ellengren, the Academy's permanent secretary, confirmed at 11:45 am that Bawendi, Brus and Ekimov were indeed this year's winners. Speaking live on the phone, Bawendi saved the committee's honor, assuring them that he was completely unaware of the mix-up and that he was fast asleep in his bed when the committee woke him to tell him the news.Damage was accordingly limited. At the press conference, however, Ellengren apologized for this departure from tradition, saying he was ""deeply sorry,"" without being able to explain, however, what might have happened. A ""very active"" investigation to determine the origin of the blunder is underway, he affirmed, assuring once again that the winners had been officially designated in the morning, but without saying whether other candidates were in the running. This will have to wait until 2073, as required by the rules, which only allow archives to be opened to the public after 50 years.",/en/science/
Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded for quantum dots breakthrough,"    Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov were recognized for their contributions to the development of the nanocrystals used in television screens, optoelectronics and biological imaging. ","On Wednesday, October 4, the Nobel Committee confirmed that it had awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Moungi Bawendi (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Louis Brus (Columbia University) and Alexei Ekimov (Nanocrystals Technology Inc.) for the development of quantum dots. The names of the winners were leaked to the Swedish press following a ""blunder"" on the part of the committee, which had mistakenly sent a press release to certain Swedish media outlets earlier that morning.Discovered in the early 1980s, quantum dots have since been used in many industrial sectors. On television screens, they facilitate the full range adjustment of diode blue light, typically enhancing color richness. They are also used in optoelectronics (thermal cameras) as infrared light detectors in particular, at a lower cost than microelectronics techniques. In biology, they can be attached to proteins or markers, aiding in pinpointing their presence in small, highly specific quantities. Some people also dream of using quantum dots as future processors for quantum computers. ""We've been waiting a long time for this award. It highlights the founders of a field that is still very active,"" noted Thomas Pons, an Inserm physicist at ESPCI-Paris-PSL, who studies neuronal activity using these nanocrystals.Following this year's Nobel Prize in Physics, the chemistry prize also acknowledges the significance of electrons. This time, the laureates haven't tried to capture their lightning-fast movement around nuclei with attosecond precision. Instead, they've managed to harness and confine electrons within materials, enabling them to generate various colors on demand.What they have in common is the development of a very small component, just a few nanometers in size, or one billionth of a meter. It is 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair...This component, originally made of cadmium sulfate or selenide, but which can also contain gallium, indium, phosphorus or arsenic, is like a mini-crystal in which electrons are trapped. This confinement gives them their quantum character. While within the same massive material, they could move freely with any energy, within this context, their energy is ""quantized"". It cannot take on any value. It's like pushing a boulder up a slope: you can't just push it, you have to push it up a series of steps. Electrons are no longer free but can jump from one level of a ladder to another.The tighter the confinement, i.e., the smaller the crystal, the further apart the levels of the ladder become and the more violet the light emitted will be after a laser has exited the box. Varying the dimensions therefore changes the colors emitted. It's exactly as if the electrons were enclosed in an artificial atom, even though the object itself is made up of several hundred atoms.",/en/science/
"Researchers find 23,000-year-old footprints in the United States","    New analyses confirm the age of footprints discovered in 2021, which prove the presence of humans in America during the last glacial maximum. ","Around 23,000 years ago, in present-day New Mexico, a group of hunters and gatherers roamed the shores of a lake surrounded by conifers and sagebrush, leaving their footprints in the mud alongside tracks of mammoths, wolves and giant sloths. These bare footprints, described in 2021 in the journal Science, are now preserved in the rock in the white gypsum desert of White Sands National Park. In a new study published on Friday, October 6, in the same journal, Matthew Bennett (University of Bournemouth, United Kingdom) and his colleagues confirm their age, using two new dating techniques.Since this discovery was announced, its age has been the subject of intense debate. These footprints challenge one of the dogmas of New World archaeology, which posits that humans did not inhabit the Americas before 13,500 years ago, the time when the ""Clovis"" culture is documented, characterized by distinctive lanceolate stone points. According to this theory, Paleo-Indians arrived in America from Asia via the Bering Strait, a route considered impassable during the last glacial maximum (approximately 26,500 to 19,000 years ago).The footprints at White Sands contradict this prevailing view. The initial dating, based on the analysis of radiocarbon in seeds of an aquatic plant called spiral rush, found mixed with the footprints, faced criticism. Radiocarbon dating can be influenced by the absorption of inorganic carbon dissolved in the water by these plants. This carbon may have an older origin, thus affecting the measurement. Recognizing this potential source of error, Bennett and his team also collected fossilized pollen samples, which are not susceptible to this ""reservoir effect."" They extracted approximately 75,000 pollen grains from each of the three samples, yielding radiocarbon dates ranging from 23,400 to 22,600 years, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2,500 years.For added reliability, they relied on a third dating method called ""optically stimulated luminescence."" This technique is based on the principle that minerals like quartz, when shielded from sunlight, accumulate charge based on the radiation they receive from their surroundings. This charge is reset when these crystals are exposed to light or heat. The time elapsed since their burial can be estimated by measuring the luminescence signal they emit when stimulated with monochromatic light. The quartz at White Sands provided a date of 21,500 years (plus or minus 2,000 years) using this method.",/en/science/
French biotech company posts promising results for cancer vaccines,"    Transgene, whose vaccines use 'viral vector' technology to trigger an immune response, has reported encouraging results from early trials with head and neck cancer patients. ","When his oncologist at the Institut Curie, the French foundation for cancer research, in Paris suggested he take part in the clinical trial of a therapeutic vaccine designed to prevent a recurrence of his tongue cancer, Hervé F didn't have to be asked twice. ""Between a high risk of relapse and the thought that through this vaccine I might have a few more years ahead of me, I didn't hesitate.""The 65-year-old had perviously undergone traditional treatment for his cancer, which was diagnosed in mid-2021 – surgery to remove the tumor, which also led to the removal of a large part of his tongue, followed by radiotherapy sessions. ""An extremely painful treatment that ended in January 2022."" When we spoke to him by phone he had some difficulty in articulating himself, but Hervé said he was speaking and eating better and better, thanks to rehabilitation.The date July 25, 2022 remains engraved on his memory. On that day, Hervé F received his first injection. Then came a further 20, one a week for the first six weeks, then every fortnight. ""If this vaccine can delay or prevent the return of the cancer, it's a tremendous hope,"" he said, adding that he was doing well, had regained weight and had not experienced any side effects.Named TG4050, the vaccine targets ENT cancers, also known as ""head and neck cancers"" (mouth, pharynx, larynx). Caused by tobacco, alcohol and, in some cases, certain types of papillomavirus, these cancers come with a high risk of recurrence – 50%. The vaccine has been developed by French biotech company Transgene, based in Illkirch-Graffenstaden, just outside Strasbourg in northeastern France, a subsidiary of Institut Mérieux and listed on the stock exchange.The international trial began in January 2021 in Toulouse, led for France by Jean-Pierre Delord, oncologist and director of the Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse (IUCT)-Oncopole, and Christophe Le Tourneau, director of the early clinical trials department at the Institut Curie. Thirty-two patients being treated for ENT cancer (negative for HPV, human papillomavirus) were included in this randomized phase 1 clinical trial (16 vaccinated patients and 16 patients in the control group).Unlike Moderna and BioNTech, which use Messenger RNA (mRNA) to develop their therapeutic vaccines, Transgene relies on ""viral vector"" technology. The aim is the same: to educate the immune system to spot anomalies to which it does not react. In other words, to stimulate T lymphocytes – the cells capable of recognizing and destroying tumor cells.",/en/science/
"In Sweden, a night of horror to explore the link between fear and pleasure","    In collaboration with Danish researchers, the Liseberg amusement park provided volunteers with an opportunity to confront their greatest fears in an experiment that took place on the night of October 11. ","""Face your worst nightmares. All alone. One night somewhere in Sweden."" Sweden's Liseberg amusement park in Gothenburg issued the challenge on September 13. To underscore the seriousness of this proposition, a short video clip was posted online, featuring images inspired by horror movie classics, such as bloodied hands, demonic laughter and a blade slicing through a piece of meat.By the September 25 deadline, 1,500 volunteers of all ages and from all over the world had applied. To take part, volunteers had to be over 18, love thrills and be available to travel to Sweden on Wednesday, October 11, when the Peak Fear Experiment would be held in collaboration with the Recreational Fear Lab, a research institute on recreational fear at the University of Aarhus, Denmark.Details of the event were kept secret, and for good reason: ""Not knowing what will happen is also part of the experience,"" said Marten Westlund, communications director at Liseberg. In tests carried out on people waiting in line for a haunted house in Denmark, Danish researchers noticed that visitors' hearts were already racing. ""People seem to systematically overestimate how scary an experience is going to be. And when they find out that it wasn't that bad, they get some relief and pleasure out of it,"" said Mathias Clasen, co-director of the laboratory.However, Westlund revealed that ""fewer than five volunteers"" would be subjected to their worst fears for one night. Among these fears, four regularly crop up: the fear of not knowing what's going to happen, the fear of heights, the fear of being alone and the fear of clowns. The volunteers would be equipped with various measuring devices, enabling scientists to gather data.To maintain safety, each candidate chose a safeword that they could say if they wanted to stop the experiment, and a doctor oversaw the experiment. The goal is to find out the optimal point between pleasure and terror. In a study published in November 2020 in the journal Psychological Science, the Aarhus researchers, who have dubbed it the fear ""sweet spot,"" demonstrated that ""enjoyment has an inverted-U-shaped relationship with fear,"" explained Clasen. To be entertaining, the fright must not be too intense, at the risk of becoming unpleasant.This was just one of many studies the Danish scientists have carried out since their first collaboration with an amusement park in 2016. Three years ago, it led to the creation of the laboratory.",/en/science/
Thomas Pesquet: 'I'd make a better living if I had stayed a pilot with Air France',"    In an autobiography, France's most famous astronaut tells all about his life above the Earth. Now addicted to space, he dreams of a third space mission. Objective: the Moon. ","The first thing that strikes you when you see Thomas Pesquet is his athletic physique, with pectoral muscles that could pop the buttons on his impeccably ironed white shirt. We were all familiar with his ""ideal son-in-law"" looks, ocean-blue eyes and good-natured smile, but we hadn't realized that a large part of the astronaut's job was to maintain a competition-winning figure at all costs. Weak eyes? A cavity? Hearing problems? You're out of the program. This is no laughing matter in the world of astronauts. We suspected as much, but on reading his autobiographical book, Ma Vie Sans Gravité (""My Life Without Gravity,"" to be published on October 18), there is – contrary to what the title suggests – little room for light-heartedness in the race to the stars.When we met him at La Closerie des Lilas – a legendary restaurant in the Montparnasse area of Paris – Pesquet ordered a Perrier with a slice of lemon. Normally, the self-described ""geographical bachelor"" – his partner, Anne, lives and works in Rome for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, while he works in Germany – allows himself to enjoy a drink with colleagues after work. But this morning, he only had time to run eight kilometers, so alcohol was out of the question. He politely asked the waiter for a table away from prying eyes. Not that he minds signing autographs, but it now happens often enough that he knows it could take all evening. He had come from Cologne, where he still works for the European Space Agency (ESA). Because Pesquet, 45, is not content with being the first Frenchman to have already been selected for two missions (Soyuz and SpaceX), totaling 396 days, 11 hours and 34 minutes in orbit: he's training hard to secure a third. A madman.When you read and hear about it from him, frankly, space adventure doesn't sound very appealing. Between his selection in 2009 and his 2016 lift-off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome (Kazakhstan), the young Pesquet, an aeronautical engineer turned Air France pilot, worked like hell, all with no guarantee of ever being chosen to climb aboard the rocket. Frankly, if we were in his shoes, we'd have given up a long time ago.Taking off is awful – especially for those who stay on the ground, family and friends, the astronaut readily admitted. ""When you say goodbye to them, you don't know if you're going to see them again."" The statistics are sobering: 5% chance of not making it back. From below, the image is, to say the least, anxiety-inducing: a giant stick of dynamite on fire. Inside, 54 hours of clenching your teeth in 3.5 square meters, a diaper in the spacesuit that makes you look like one of the Teletubbies, an 80-centimeter-diameter ""corridor"" to get out of the capsule – if you're claustrophobic, don't bother. Once inside the International Space Station, things don't get much better, comfort-wise. Insomniacs will get no help here: you have to sleep with your pillow attached to your head, without a blanket – because of the absence of gravity – and put up with 16 sunsets and sunrises every 24 hours. Hygiene-wise, we won't bore you with the details: wash with a towelette, underpants every other day, two pairs of socks a week, and don't miss the toilet (10 centimeters in diameter).",/en/science/
"An archaeological dig near Paris unearthed beginnings of urbanization dating back to 4,200 BC",    Archaeologists recently finished exploring the remains of a village in Ivry-sur-Seine surrounded by a vast wooden enclosure from the so-called 'Cerny' culture. ,"Tirelessly and methodically, a small group of archaeologists from the Institut National de Recherches Archéologiques Préventives (INRAP) and the Val-de-Marne department's archaeology service worked to rescue the settlement of our distant Middle Neolithic ancestors, 6,000 years ago, from oblivion and into the light. Time was of the essence. The day was September 27, and they had only two days before they would have to pack up and hand over the site to Ivry Confluences, one of the largest urban development projects in Paris' inner suburbs (145 hectares), near the junction of the Seine and the Marne rivers on the territory of Ivry-sur-Seine (Paris region), which has been underway for over ten years. These archaeological excavations are being carried out on the orders of the French state.What makes this latest campaign exceptional is the richness, density and quality of its finds. In recent years, 11 campaigns have been organized on several plots of land, three of them on the former site of the BHV department stores' warehouses, closed in 2012: In 2014, 2017, and this year from April to September.According to INRAP archaeologist Fabrice Marti in charge of the dig, 2023 is shaping up to be a vintage year. ""We came across portions of Middle Megalithic 1 walls, more specifically from the Cerny culture. A diagnosis usually enables us to more or less know what to expect, but this has been a very big surprise. We're inside a village. It's a first for this period. There's no equivalent."" The Cerny, named after a town in Essonne (south of Paris), spread across much of northern France and especially the Paris basin from the second half of the fifth millennium BC. It was characterized by the construction of walls, the rearing of cattle, and the production of ceramics with round pots adorned with geometric motifs hallmarked in bands. It also marked the beginning of megalithism in France.The first Ivry residents settled here around 4,200 BC. They built a wall, the full length of which has not been found, but it is estimated that several thousand large trees (around 30 centimeters in diameter) had to be felled to erect it. Because the site was a wet meadow, the trees had to be brought in from another location – a monumental task.Around 5,500 artifacts have been discovered, including shards of Cerny ceramics, flint, arrowheads, broken stone axes and two small pieces of jewelry made from elongated shells from the Atlantic Ocean... On the flip side, very few skeletal remains have been found. They were probably used to make glue or various objects, such as needles. This would imply that the meat they ate mainly came from livestock, with the overwhelming majority being beef and the remainder divided between mutton, goat and pork. As for game, which very much provided a minority of their meat supplies, it consisted of deer and wild boar.",/en/science/
'Ring of fire' eclipse brings cheers and shouts of joy  across the Americas,News,"First came the darkening skies, then the crescent-shaped shadows on the ground, and finally an eruption of cheers by crowds that gathered Saturday, October 14, along the narrow path of a rare ""ring of fire"" eclipse of the sun. It was a spectacular show for millions of people across the Americas as the moon moved into place and blocked out all but a brilliant circle of the sun's outer edge.Hundreds of people filed into the planetarium in the Caribbean resort city of Cancún to watch the eclipse. Some peered through box projectors, while others looked through telescopes and special glasses. Excited children whistled, as some adults raised their arms toward the sky as if to welcome the eclipse.Vendors selling plants outside observed the dance between the moon and the sun in a more natural way – with the help of trees as the shifting sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting unique shadows on the sidewalk.""There was silence and like a mist, as if it was dusk, but only a few minutes later the birds were singing again,"" said Carmen Jardines, 56, one of the vendors.Artemia Carreto, was telling passersby about her experience as a child in southern Mexico, when they were told to look instead at the river where it reflected beautifully on the sand beneath the water.While she wasn't near a river this time, Carreto said she was carried away by the sensations induced by changing temperatures and a feeling of heaviness that she pegged to the rotation of the Earth.Ancient Maya astronomers who tracked the movements of the sun and moon with precision referred to eclipses as ""broken sun."" They may have used dark volcanic glass to protect their eyes, said archeologist Arturo Montero of Tepeyac University in Mexico City.Unlike a total solar eclipse , the moon doesn't completely cover the sun during a ring of fire eclipse. When the moon lines up between Earth and the sun, it leaves a bright, blazing border.The entire eclipse – from the moment the moon starts to obscure the sun until it's back to normal – lasted 2 1/2 to three hours at any given spot. The ring of fire portion was from three to five minutes, depending on the location.Saturday's US path: Oregon, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Texas in the US, with a sliver of California, Arizona and Colorado. Then: Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Brazil. Much of the rest of the Western Hemisphere got a partial eclipse. NASA and other groups livestreamed the event.In Mexico, hundreds of people filed into the planetarium in the Caribbean resort city of Cancun to watch the eclipse. Some people peered through box projectors, while others looked through telescopes and special glasses.Excited children whistled, as some adults raised their arms towards the sky as if to welcome the eclipse. ""It is the third one that I have seen, but I come because of the energy it gives you. It is something that nature brings us and that we must watch,"" said Pilar Cáceres, 77, a retired elementary school teacher who watched the eclipse through a piece of cardboard that reflected the shadow on the ground.Cáceres wondered how the Maya civilization would observe the celestial event, because they were fearful of the phenomenon despite being great astronomers. ""We were told that some Maya people thought that eclipses were a curse because they burned their eyes and made them blind,"" she said.The Maya – who called eclipses ""broken sun"" – may have used dark volcanic glass to protect their eyes, said archeologist Arturo Montero of Tepeyac University in Mexico City.In the US, some eclipse watchers traveled to remote corners of the country to try to get the best view possible while those in Albuquerque got a double treat as the eclipse coincided with an international balloon fiesta that typically draws tens of thousands of spectators and hundreds of hot air balloon pilots from around the world.There were hoots, hollers and yelps from the balloon launch field as the moon began to cover the sun. Some pilots used their propane burners to shoot flames upward in unison as the spectacle unfolded. ""It's very exciting to be here and have the convergence of our love of flying with something very natural like an eclipse,"" said Allan Hahn, a balloon pilot from Aurora, Colorado.At Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah, enthusiasts hit the trails before sunrise to stake out their preferred spots among the red rock hoodoos. With the ring of fire in full form, cheers echoed through the canyons of the park. ""I just think it's one of those things that unites us all,"" said John Edwards, a cancer drug developer who traveled alone across the country to watch the eclipse from Bryce Canyon.Kirby James and Caroline McGuire from Toronto didn't realize they would be in a prime spot when they planned their trip to southern Utah. ""Nothing that you can read could prepare you for how it feels,"" said Kirby James, 63, a co-founder of a software company. ""It's the moment, especially when the ring of fire came on, you realized you were having a lifetime experience.""For the small towns and cities along the path, there was a mix of excitement, worries about the weather and concerns they'd be overwhelmed by visitors flocking to see the annular solar eclipse.In Eugene, Oregon, oohs and ahs combined with groans of disappointment as the eclipse was intermittently visible, the sun's light poking through the cloud cover only at times.Koren Marsh and her parents drove five hours from Seattle to be within the path of the eclipse. Making the trip to see the ring of fire was part of the celebrations for her 16th birthday, and she still appreciated getting glimpses between the clouds. ""It was worth it to me because I like science,"" she said.Viewers on the East Coast saw much less of the event, if anything. Much of the northeastern part of the region was socked in by clouds and rain.In southern Colombia, the Tatacoa desert played host to astronomers helping a group of visually impaired people experience the perfect golden ring created by the moon and sun through raised maps and temperature changes.Colombia Science Minister Yesenia Olaya said moments like this should inspire people to promote science among children, so they see it as ""a life project."" Juan Pablo Esguerra, 13, waited months to make the trip to the desert with his father to witness the eclipse. ""I like the astronomy because it's a spectacular experience,"" he said. ""This is the best that I've seen in my life.""In Mexico City, some children came dressed as astronauts as thousands of people gathered at the main esplanade of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the country's main public college. People shared special glasses, and the university set up telescopes.Saturday's eclipse marked the first for Brazil since 1994. The country's national observatory broadcast the event online while thousands flocked to parks and beaches in the north and northeastern regions to soak in the phenomenon.In April 2024, a total solar eclipse will crisscross the US in the opposite direction. That one will begin in Mexico and go from Texas to New England before ending in eastern Canada. The next ring of fire eclipse is in October 2024 at the southernmost tip of South America. Antarctica gets one in 2026. It will be 2039 before another ring of fire is visible in the US, and Alaska will be the only state in its direct path.",/en/science/
"Tree stumps reveal exceptional 14,300-year-old solar storm","    By analyzing the carbon-14 contained in prehistoric Scots pine trees, a French-British team has been able to trace a major solar eruption. ","Trees keep a chronicle of the past which researchers can read in two ways. The first, known as ""dendrochronology,"" involves counting and studying tree rings, the rings of wood that form each year at the periphery of the trunk. In Paris's Natural History Museum, it is possible to view the cross-section of a giant sequoia some 2,000 years old, with labels going back to the birth of Christ.The second way of tracing the past through wood is based on the carbon-14 present in each ring. By combining the two methods on the remains of very old trees, a French-British team has just made an astonishing discovery. In an article published on October 9 in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, the team revealed that there was an exceptional solar storm 14,300 years ago, undetected until now.To understand the link between tree remains thousands of years old and solar ejections 150 million kilometers away, it is important to delve into carbon-14. This radioactive carbon isotope is virtually stable in the atmosphere. Its gradual decay (which explains why it can't be used to date archaeological objects that are more than 55,000 years old) is constantly offset by the formation of new atoms, thanks to the cosmic rays that constantly reach the Earth. At the end of a cascade of reactions, a neutron takes the place of a proton in the nucleus of nitrogen atoms, transmuting them into carbon-14 atoms.So much for the everyday life of 14C, as atomic physicists write the isotope. Occasionally, however, the Sun gets in on the act. During one of its eruptions (or coronal mass ejections) large amounts of electrically charged particles are propelled into space. On reaching the Earth, they form a carbon-14 surplus in the atmosphere. If the amount of matter ejected is colossal, this extra 14C is detected in wood. This phenomenon was revealed in 2012 by Japanese researcher Fusa Miyake, who, when studying Japanese cedars, discovered a carbon-14 peak for the year 774, attributed to a solar event.The Scots pines involved in the latest discovery are much older trees, called ""subfossil trees."" Edouard Bard, Professor at the Collège de France and lead author of the study published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A explained: ""We call them 'subfossils' because, without being rock, they have begun a small transformation."" For the study, the European Centre for Research and Teaching in Environmental Geosciences, where Bard works, drew on the wood samples that the Mediterranean Institute of Biodiversity and Marine and Continental Ecology has been collecting for a quarter of a century, in the southern Alps between Grenoble and Sisteron. Buried in the thick alluvial deposits of the Drouzet, a local river, 172 subfossil trees have been recovered and studied.",/en/science/
'The European space industry needs to get its act together before it's too late',    The space summit that will be held in Seville in early November is a crucial opportunity to revamp the industry's organization from top to bottom and set ambitious and inspiring targets. ,"The European space industry is at a pivotal point in its history. The sector is going through a launch vehicle crisis, marked by the successive postponement of the Ariane 6 while the Vega-C rocket is still grounded. These setbacks have been coupled with deep-seated disagreements between European countries over its strategy. The European Space Summit that will be held in Seville, Spain, on November 6 and 7 is a crucial event for the continent's technological future.Europe must seize this opportunity to revamp the industry's organization from top to bottom and set ambitious and inspiring targets. Otherwise, Europe runs the risk of ending up on the wrong side of the telescope, condemning themselves to being spectators in a space race that has only just begun.The delay of the European launchers and the technical problems are only the tip of the iceberg. Behind these temporary misfires lies a deeper problem illustrated by the US competition, SpaceX.From launcher sizes, reusability, and economies of scale, the factors that can be used to lower transport costs for customers are in SpaceX's, owned by Elon Musk, favor. Added to this is SpaceX's fearsome efficiency in terms of decision-making speed and ability to adapt to unforeseen events, made possible thanks to greater digitalization.Europe, on the other hand, is locked into the rule of the ""geographical return."" In practice, each country contributing to the European Space Agency's (ESA) budget ends up recovering the equivalent of its contribution as contracts awarded to its industry, even if the country is not the best performer in its field. This model's cumbersome and inefficient nature has become a burden in the new space age.""The problem for Europe is not just a question of financial resources: For every euro invested, SpaceX is ten times more efficient, and the only way to increase efficiency is to introduce competition,"" argued Cédric O, a former French secretary of state for digital affairs and the co-author of ""Revolution Space,"" a report written by 12 experts and presented to the ESA in March.Competition: The word was long considered taboo until Germany sought to free itself from a model deemed too costly and that it suspected primarily served France's interests. Historically, France's nuclear deterrence has relied on technology launcher technology. German patience finally reached its limits a year ago, when Arianespace's then-boss promised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in person that the first Ariane 6 launch would take place in 2023, even though this was an impossible pledge. Since then, mistrust has reached new heights, such that Berlin has told Ariane, ""nein, danke.""",/en/science/
How gestation remodels brains of mice to promote maternal behaviors,    Two sex hormones target a small population of neurons in the rodent brain to prepare it for motherhood. ,"After every mammal birth, if everything goes well, a small miracle happens: maternal attachment. But to what extent are maternal behaviors linked to changes in the brains of mothers-to-be during pregnancy? In the October 6 issue of the journal Science, a British team from the Francis-Crick Institute in London provided part of the answer. In mice, two sex hormones remodel the mother's brain during gestation, promoting behaviors such as returning to the nest, grooming and breastfeeding.It was long thought that the sex hormones released during childbirth played a decisive role in the onset of maternal care. However, the British study showed that estradiol and progesterone are active in the brain of the mother-to-be even before she gives birth.Here's how: These two hormones target a small region of the hypothalamus, called the medial preoptic area, known for its important role in the control of mating and offspring care. To be more precise, these hormones act on a small population of neurons within this region, called the ""galanin neurons,"" which govern maternal behavior.In female mice that had never mated, the authors made these neurons insensitive to one or both of these hormones by selectively inactivating the hormone receptors carried by the cells. Then they let half of those females mate. As a result, those that had offspring showed a complete loss of feeding behavior.But the two hormones worked differently. Estradiol made the neurons more excitable, fortifying the mothers' receptiveness to their offspring's signals. This modification faded as the offspring grew.Progesterone, on the other hand, encouraged the formation of excitatory synapses on the galanin neurons. This rewiring persisted, reinforcing maternal behavior long after the offspring had been weaned. ""This observation would explain why females of many species behave maternally towards offspring that are not their own, once they have experienced motherhood,"" said Margaret McCarthy from the University of Maryland in Baltimore (USA).London team coordinator Johannes Kohl said, ""What's fascinating is to see that the brain prepares well before birth for this major life change."" Its rewiring leads to ""a shift in priorities"": While virgin mice focus on mating, mothers must ensure the survival of their young. Postdoctoral fellow Rachida Ammari, first author of the paper, added, ""To prepare for this future behavioral challenge, there is a window of plasticity in the brain.""According to the authors, women's brains also undergo a similar process during pregnancy. In mothers' brains, in fact, there is a before and after those nine months of accommodation and growth of the fetus in utero, as was revealed by a Dutch team in 2022. On the one hand, pregnancy seems to induce specific and lasting changes in the volume of cerebral gray matter. It reorganizes a small region involved in our ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes, which is the same region that is activated when mothers look at their babies. This reorganization seems to last at least two years after delivery. On the other hand, the brain's white matter is also remodeled. As in mice, this reconfiguration seems to be linked to estradiol, which is released during the third trimester of pregnancy. This could be one of the keys to a mother's attachment to her offspring and her receptiveness to the signals they send her, even if it's not the only determining factor. A special bond, of course, can also develop during the process of adoption.",/en/science/
Artificial Intelligence deciphers images perceived by the human brain,"    A Meta team has reproduced, in some cases with impressive precision, photographs viewed by volunteers based on AI analysis of their brain activity. ","Will artificial intelligence (AI) one day be able to read our brains and track our thoughts? A series of recent studies suggests that AI is capable of decoding and translating our cerebral activity, in the form of text and images, as we're listening to a story, wanting to talk, or looking at images. The latest of this work, presented in Paris on Wednesday, October 18, by a team from Meta AI (formerly Facebook), demonstrates these spectacular advances.Jean-Rémi King and his colleagues described how their AI algorithms were able to faithfully reproduce photographs viewed by volunteers, based on analysis of their brain activity. Their observations were presented in a preprint – a paper not yet peer-reviewed before publication in a scientific journal. They were based on data sets obtained by magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on volunteers who were shown photographs. This data was then submitted to a series of AI decoders, which learned to interpret and transcribe them back into images.The result? Although the likeness between the original and the copy is not perfect, the similarities are often striking. A zebra is clad in a cross between cowhide and okapi, a little girl with a kite has an unidentified object above her head, but a surfer seems to be riding the same wave as the model in the photo, and a skier in a red wetsuit retains the same posture as the original. The ""wow effect"" is guaranteed, ""even for the researchers on our team,"" admitted King, an academic researcher (CNRS, ENS) currently on a five-year assignment with Meta AI. ""Just two years ago, I would have never thought that this kind of result would be possible.""In recent months, several papers in the field of speech have demonstrated the potential of AI to decode brain activity, whether by invasive means – data collection via electrodes implanted in the brain of paralyzed people – or non-invasive ones, as with MEG, fMRI, large machines in which the subjects' heads are immersed, but also with a simple cap for electroencephalograms (EEG).On May 1 in the journal Nature Neuroscience, a team from the University of Austin (Texas), led by Alexander Huth, described an attempt to use an AI decoder to reproduce short stories heard by subjects placed in an fMRI scanner. The experiment was not entirely conclusive but showed that the AI could partially retrieve the words and general meaning. It was also able to produce a text from a story imagined by the volunteers, or from a video they watched. Part of the meaning was preserved, with greater fidelity than a purely random text. It's as if the brain, through these various modalities – by listening to, imagining or observing the narrative – produced ""a neural code shared between the visual and the spoken word,"" said King.",/en/science/
China launches new mission to space station,    The world's second-largest economy has pumped billions of dollars into its military-run space program in an effort to catch up with the United States and Russia. ,"China sent a fresh crew to its Tiangong space station on Thursday, October 26, in the latest mission for a growing space program that plans to send people to the Moon by 2030.The Shenzhou-17 blasted off from the Jiuquan launch site in northwest China at 11:14 am (4:14 am Paris time), carrying a three-astronaut team with the youngest average age since the space station's construction.At a farewell ceremony, hundreds of supporters waving the Chinese national flag and clutching yellow flowers cheered on the three astronauts – wearing white and blue spacesuits – as they were introduced to the crowds. The patriotic song ""Ode to the Motherland"" was sung as the space travelers walked slowly down a short pathway between the crowds, smiling and waving goodbye before boarding a bus to the launch site.Captaining the crew is Tang Hongbo, who is on his first return mission to the space station. Accompanying him are Tang Shengjie and Jiang Xinlin, both in their thirties and each making maiden space voyages. The all-male crew is the youngest ever to man a mission to the space station, with an average age of 38.They are set to ""perform various in-orbit space science and application payload tests and experiments,"" Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday. They will also conduct some maintenance work on the station to fix some ""minor damages"" from space debris, he said. ""We have found that the solar wings of the space station had been hit by tiny space particles several times,"" Lin explained.Members of the previous Shenzhou-16 crew – aboard Tiangong for nearly five months now – are preparing to receive the trio before returning to Earth next week.Hundreds of spectators gathered on Thursday morning near the rocket site at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, in the Gobi Desert, some wearing the blue uniforms of China's space agency. Excitement broke out among the crowd as a loudspeaker blared a countdown and the rocket lifted off, sending plumes of smoke across the launch pad and the dry, flat desert expanse surrounding the site, before the increasingly loud roar of the engines drowned out the applause.A livestream showed the crew onboard the space station monitoring their ascent in anticipation of their arrival. After the rocket had been airborne for about 15 minutes, a space program official proclaimed the launch a ""complete success."" Tiangong, the crown jewel of Beijing's space programme, is constantly crewed by rotating teams of three astronauts.Plans for China's ""space dream"" have been put into overdrive under President Xi Jinping. The world's second-largest economy has pumped billions of dollars into its military-run space program in an effort to catch up with the United States and Russia.In June, the return capsule of the Shenzhou-15 spaceship touched down at a landing site in the northern Inner Mongolia region, with state media hailing the mission as a ""complete success.""That month also saw the launch of the Shenzhou-16 capsule, which carried the first Chinese civilian – Beihang University professor Gui Haichao – into orbit. That crew will return to Earth on October 31 after completing a handover, officials said Wednesday.Beijing also aims to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030 and plans to build a base on the lunar surface. Deputy director Lin reiterated that aim Wednesday, saying that the ""goal of landing Chinese people on the moon by 2030 will be realized as scheduled.""",/en/science/
Enigma of Mars' internal structure finally solved,    Two studies published Wednesday in the journal 'Nature' conclude that there is a 150-kilometer-thick layer of magma in the lower part of the mantle surrounding the Red Planet's core. ,"In December 2022, NASA announced the end of its InSight Mars mission. After more than four years on the surface of the Red Planet, the lander, on whose panels a thick layer of dust had settled, no longer had enough energy to work. Death by suffocation, as it were. However, in space exploration, long after the robots stop working, the data recorded continues to feed science, and InSight is no exception. The anomaly in the internal structure of Mars was resolved on Wednesday, October 25, in the journal Nature, which published two studies, independent of each other but based on measurements from the lander's main instrument, the SEIS seismometer supplied by France.Two years ago, in the summer of 2021, the InSight team described the internal structure of Mars for the first time. To achieve this, they deciphered the seismic waves created by ""Marsquakes"" and meteorite impacts. The speed at which these waves propagate depends on the properties (such as density, temperature and compressibility) of the medium they pass through. This reveals its chemical composition and whether it is solid, soft or liquid. The result obtained in 2021 shows three simple layers: a thin crust overlying a rocky, homogeneous and unstratified mantle, which itself surrounds a fairly large metallic and liquid core, with a radius of 1,830 kilometers (the Martian radius measures 3,390 kilometers).However, there was a snag, an anomaly summarized by Henri Samuel, a CNRS researcher working at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) and lead author of one of the two studies: ""The nucleus we had was not very dense. To achieve this low density, we had to add light elements to the iron, such as sulfur, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. The problem was that we had to add a lot, too much compared to what was allowed.""Of course, there's no instruction manual for a planetary core, but the laws of physics and chemistry do set constraints. ""Experiments have been carried out in the laboratory, under high temperature and pressure, attempting to incorporate light elements into iron alloys,"" said Samuel. ""The limits that these tests established were somewhat exceeded by data from the Mars core.""What's more, the quantities of light elements assumed to be present in the Mars core did not tally with the materials available at the time of planet formation, 4.5 billion years ago. Since the anomaly could not be solved, ""we learned to live with it,"" said Samuel with a smile.However, on September 18, 2021, an unexpected event shed new light on the matter. On that day, a meteorite crashed on Mars, some distance from InSight. This generated waves that were different from the previous ones and capable of propagating in liquid, where their speed was halved. As Samuel pointed out, ""the propagation time recorded for this event was far too slow to be explained by a homogeneous, solid mantle."" The 2021 model no longer held water: the mantle had to be heterogeneous and based on a liquid layer, which is stable because it is weighed down by iron, which had previously been confused with the upper part of the core.",/en/science/
Wild chimpanzees also experience menopause,"    This is a first for a wild primate. In the community of Ngogo, Uganda, females continue to live up to 10 years after the end of their fertile period, according to a study published Friday in the journal 'Science.' ","This discovery promises intense debate among primatologists, anthropologists and doctors alike. On Friday, October 27, American scientists announced, in the journal Science, that they had for the first time demonstrated the presence of menopausal females in a group of wild chimpanzees.The observation was made by Kevin Langergraber's team from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), using data collected over a period of 21 years on the Ngogo community, a group of over 200 chimpanzees based in Uganda's Kibale National Park. According to the researchers' calculations, females spend an average of 20% of their adult lives in a ""post-reproductive"" state.In the wild, almost no vertebrate lives beyond its reproductive period, with the exception of a few species of toothed whales (including orcas) and humans. The laws of evolution seem clear: what's the point of a species burdening itself with individuals unable to procreate? As for humans, there are two opposing theories. The cooperative theory, often summarized as the ""grandmother hypothesis,"" holds that post-menopausal females help their daughters with maternal care, thereby boosting their grandchildren's chances of survival, and therefore the transmission of their genes. The other, known as the competition theory, considers that menopause helps to avoid a struggle for resources to raise a calf within the same family, between mothers of two different generations – mother and daughter or mother-in-law and daughter-in-law – from which the older ones could come out on the losing side. In orcas, the key role played by matriarchs argues in favor of the cooperation theory.What about non-human primates? In zoos, several studies have found that females spend an average of 20% to 25% of their lives without reproducing. But captivity upsets all life parameters, especially longevity. So it's out of the question to draw any rules from such observations. Conversely, menopause has never been observed in any wild population.It's now a fact, said the UCLA researchers. They base their claim on 21 years of data collected between 1995 and 2016 at Ngogo, in the center of Kibale National Park, in southwestern Uganda. A considerable amount of work according to program coordinator Kevin Langergraber. ""This means 20 years in the forest, almost every day, to record births, deaths, emigrations and female immigrations between the different groups,"" he explained. They collected demographic data on 185 females.They show that these animals began to give birth from the age of 13 or 14, with a peak between 15 and 19, and that a clear decline in fertility was observed from the age of 30 onwards, with a total halt ""near age 50, as in humans,"" the article stressed.",/en/science/
Scientific journal impacted by Israel-Hamas war,"    The editor-in-chief of 'eLife' magazine, Michael Eisen, was fired after a controversial tweet about the Israel-Hamas war, provoking a debate about freedom of speech. ","The shockwaves of the Israel-Hamas war continue to spread. Scientific journals, which might have thought themselves immune from the tremors, are now being hit. The editor-in-chief of the scientific journal eLife, Michael Eisen, was dismissed on October 24 following a controversial tweet on X (formerly Twitter). This decision on the part of the board of directors has provoked a heated debate within the publication but also more widely in the research community, where many voices were upset by this challenge to freedom of expression.It all began on October 13. Eisen, who is a professor of biology at the University of California, Berkeley, and has run the journal since 2019, retweeted an article, on his personal account,  from the satirical newspaper The Onion about the bombings in Gaza. Its headline sets the tone: ""Dying Gazans Criticized For Not Using Last Words To Condemn Hamas."" ""Bingo,"" Eisen commented. He then posted a second tweet: ""The Onion speaks with more courage, insight and moral clarity than the leaders of every academic institution put together. I wish there were a @TheOnion university.""The controversy quickly spread on the social media platform, an amplifier of all negative feelings. A number of Israeli scientists announced that they would no longer submit articles to the magazine as long as Eisen was editor-in-chief. This first led the board to distance itself from the offending tweet. Then, on October 24, it announced Eisen's ""replacement."" The stated reason: ""[H]is approach to leadership, communication and social media has at key times been detrimental to the cohesion of the community we are trying to build and hence to eLife's mission."" According to this statement, his tweet was just ""a further incidence of this behavior.""It's true that Eisen is not exactly a champion of consensus. A renowned molecular biologist, he has gained much of his celebrity for the fight he has waged over the past 25 years against the dominant model of scientific publishing, which elevates journals as the sole judges of the quality of scientific work and imposes exorbitant access fees on readers. With two other researchers, he first created the PLOS group, which offers readers free access to published content. This alternative model, which charges publication fees to the authors of the articles, has been a great success – but has also earned Eisen some strong enemies in the process.Things got even worse in 2019, when he transformed eLife. The journal now only publishes articles that have already been submitted to preprint servers. What's more, it makes all peer reviews public, unlike most journals. And, since January this year, all peer-reviewed articles are published, even if the reviews are negative. No more monopoly on publication, no more secret judgments, no more rejection by reviewers...",/en/science/
Europe's space industry searches for a way out of its crisis,"    The 22 member states of the European Space Agency are meeting in Seville on Monday, in an attempt to find a compromise between the German and French positions and to secure the funding operation of Ariane-6. ","A bitter anniversary looms. On December 2, 2014, unsettled by the sudden emergence of Elon Musk, who was imposing himself on the launcher market by smashing prices, the Europeans reacted by deciding to design Ariane-6, a rocket capable of competing with the billionaire's Falcon 9s. The goal was to achieve a first flight in July 2020.Almost nine years later, this deadline has long passed unachieved. Worse still, Musk's SpaceX dominates the market and sets the rules. As of this autumn, Europe no longer has access to space. The last Ariane-5 was launched in July and the planned transition to its successor, Ariane-6, has not gone ahead as planned due to accumulated delays. The first launch is not expected before 2024. To make matters worse, the small Italian Vega rocket made its last launch in October, and the program for the next model, Vega-C, was suspended after an in-flight failure.In addition to the technical and industrial difficulties experienced by the Ariane-6 program and its cumbersome organization, political tensions have been mounting in recent years. Germany, one of the three main partners in the project led by the European Space Agency (ESA), alongside France, the program's prime contractor, and Italy, now wants to go it alone in space. It intends to put an end to ArianeGroup's French leadership in this field by pursuing its own development of mini-launch vehicles, which would compete with Ariane and Vega. To open the competition up, Berlin is exerting pressure by threatening to stop funding the European launcher, judged to be too expensive and poorly managed.It is against this tense backdrop that the representatives of ESA's 22 member countries will meet on Monday, November 6 in Seville (Spain). This looks set to be a crucial meeting for the first of the two days of the Space Summit, held every six months in the country currently holding the rotating presidency of Europe – currently Spain – and which will continue the following day, Tuesday, with a European Union Council meeting devoted to space issues.The aim is to find a compromise that guarantees the first 10 years of the Ariane-6 operation and to prepare for the future by opening up the launcher market to competition. If the discussions succeed, a new chapter in European space history will be written, marked by a paradigm shift similar to that experienced in the United States with the arrival of private competitors such as Musk.The controversial issue is the funding of Ariane-6. Over time, the program's cost overruns have been grudgingly acknowledged by all participants who subscribed to the first 15 launches. But nothing has been resolved for the next phase, the operational phase. Initially, ESA's plan was for Ariane-6 to become autonomous from the 16th launch, with no need for additional contributions from member states. This is not the case, as soaring raw material prices and general inflation have aggravated the situation.",/en/science/
Europe's Euclid satellite reveals its first images of the cosmos,"    The satellite, whose mission will be to track down dark matter and dark energy, will enter its operational phase in January 2024. ","The Perseus cluster of galaxies, the famous Horsehead Nebula in the constellation Orion, the beautiful spiral galaxy IC 342, the irregular galaxy NGC 6822 and a globular cluster of stars located in the Milky Way 7,800 light-years from Earth: These are the subjects of the first five color photographs taken by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid satellite and unveiled on Tuesday, November 7. They were not five close-up portraits, but rather five landscapes. Euclid's main characteristic is to take wide-field images, unlike the Hubble or James Webb Space Telescopes, which focus their gaze on tiny portions of the sky.Launched on July 1 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the cosmology satellite, whose mission is to track down dark matter and dark energy – two mysterious entities that form 95% of the Universe – has still not entered its operational phase. It took a month to reach its final destination, the 2nd Lagrange point, a stable zone in space 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, on the opposite side of the Sun. This is where the James Webb Space Telescope is also located. The next step was to check that the device and its instruments were working properly, with all its challenges.The ESA was disappointed to discover that, at times, Euclid's fine guidance system, disturbed by protons from the Sun, was losing its guide stars, which had the effect of destabilizing the device and producing images where the stars appeared to be looping. To put things right, a corrective patch had to be written and uploaded to the satellite.Another area of concern for researchers was the phenomenon of ice deposition. As Francis Bernardeau, an astrophysicist at the French research laboratory CEA and deputy head of the Euclid scientific consortium, which brings together more than 250 laboratories worldwide, explained, ""the water contained in the satellite's materials evaporates and re-condenses on the instruments. This is a problem encountered by every space imager, which is very difficult to assess and model. But in this case, with Euclid, we're better off than we thought.""The researchers and engineers who remotely monitor the satellite are now in the process of evaluating its performance. This is crucial, as Euclid is aiming for extremely high image quality in order to study the distribution of dark matter and draw up the largest three-dimensional map of the Universe. The gamble appears to have paid off, according to Bernardeau: ""As far as image sharpness is concerned, we're well up to expectations. The trick will be to maintain this quality over the six years of the mission."" Nevertheless, the images revealed on November 7 reveal the presence of strange bluish spots. ""These are ghost images due to the inevitable imperfections of the optical system,"" explained the CEA researcher. ""But once everything is calibrated, we'll be able to clean them up.""",/en/science/
The crucial paradigm shift undertaken by Europe's space agency,The ESA opened up its market to greater competition at a time when control of space has become a question of sovereignty in an increasingly conflict-ridden world.,"Once again, the principle that Europe only makes progress during crises is proving true. At a time when the European space sector is going through one of the most difficult periods in its history, the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA) took a salutary leap forward in an attempt to get out of the rut at the Seville summit on November 6 and 7. By radically modifying its organization and opening up its market to greater competition, Europe's space industry is undergoing an essential paradigm shift. But this shift is only one step toward ensuring that the European Union fully masters its destiny in this field.At a time when the international space race was in full swing, the situation called for an urgent response, without which Europe was destined for irredeemable relegation. Deprived of a launcher for months due to the repeated delays of Ariane-6 and the temporary failure of Italy's Vega-C rocket, outclassed by Elon Musk's SpaceX, ESA was at an impasse. In just eight years, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets have carried out as many launches as Ariane-5 did in 27 years, and the performance gap between the two models continues to widen.The agreement reached in Seville was a compromise set against a backdrop of French-German rivalries. The French side could be satisfied with having secured financing for Ariane-6 operations for the next few years, in exchange for cost-cutting efforts. In return, the Germans have opened up the launcher market to competition. This is a major shift, but not unprecedented: NASA underwent a similar restructuring 15 years ago, culminating in the success of SpaceX.This choice marks a smooth transition from the ""geographical return"" rule, which had become entangled with bureaucracy and costs at a time when the ecosystem is undergoing profound change with the emergence of the new space industry. Until now, each country contributing to the ESA budget could recover an amount equivalent to its contribution in the form of contracts awarded to its industry, even if it was not the best performer in its field. The organization of a competition is intended to make the European space industry more responsive and efficient.At the same time, ESA has also been given the go-ahead to launch a tender for a cargo spacecraft capable of shuttling goods between Earth and low-Earth orbit. It will be up to companies in the sector to define their own project and raise funds from private investors within the framework set by the European agency. In the absence of its own resources, the ESA was condemned to stagnation in the field of space exploration. The tendering solution opens up new prospects, including the possibility of manned flight in the longer term.Although belated, this move away from a pattern that has run out of steam comes at a time when control of space has become a question of sovereignty in an increasingly conflict-ridden world, in which technological competition is exacerbated. In the long term, this context will also call for a change in decision-making within Europe's space industry. The EU cannot simply remain one of ESA's clients (which include Switzerland, the UK and Norway). It must be able to take its space destiny into its own hands, to ensure its sovereignty. This ambition necessarily requires a change in governance, which has yet to be achieved.",/en/science/
Crisis over for Europe’s Ariane-6 rocket,"    After two years of tension between France and Germany, a financial agreement guaranteeing the operation of the future launcher was reached on Monday, at a meeting of the 22 member states of the European Space Agency. ","The purpose of this audit was to get Ariane-6 out of the crisis. At the meeting in Seville on Monday, November 6, the 22 member states of the European Space Agency (ESA) reached an agreement to ensure the operation of the future launcher. The agreement was subject to conditions, as the first step is to limit public funding to a maximum of €340 million per year for three years from 2026.France, the principal sponsor for the ESA program, will contribute 55.3%, followed by Germany (21%) and Italy (7.6%), with the remainder divided between the 10 other countries participating in the project. To achieve this, the manufacturers involved – mainly France’s ArianeGroup, Germany’s MT Aerospace and Italy’s Avio – were asked to reduce their costs by 11%. An audit was underway to achieve this. The aim was even to reduce public funding to below €300 million over the years.This financial commitment guaranteed 27 Ariane-6 launches between 2026 and 2028. What’s more, France, Germany and Italy decided to go beyond these three years, adding a further 18 months and committing to a further 15 launches, for a total of 42 launches between now and 2030. ""This guarantees the solidity of the Ariane-6 business model for the next decade,"" said the Paris-based company.Reaching an agreement was a prerequisite for France to make progress on other issues, in the face of Germany, which for two years had been contesting the management of the project and calling for the launcher market to be opened up to competition. France was all the more insistent in view of the fact that, after the €4 billion invested in Ariane-6 for its development, the operating phase after the 16th launch in 2026 was initially scheduled to be self-financing. This has not happened, however, due to the sharp rise in raw material prices and the return of inflation since the war in Ukraine.""The priority is to get Ariane-6 to its maiden flight as quickly as possible, and to get Vega-C back on track,"" insisted ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher, the imperative for Europe being to regain autonomous access to space as quickly as possible, something it has lost in recent months. Both Ariane-6 (launched four years late) and the small Italian rocket Vega-C will have to wait until 2024.In return for continued support for Ariane-6, an agreement was reached to open up the European launcher market to competition, in a space market destabilized over the last ten years by the arrival of Elon Musk with Space X.",/en/science/
"Scientists make heads, instead of tails, of starfish anatomy","    An international study has unraveled the age-old mystery: that the echinoderm has no tail or trunk, just a head. ","It sounds like a children's game or an absurd question: Where is the starfish's head? In reality, the enigma has been occupying specialists for over a century, given the unusual structure of the animal and all its cousins in the echinoderm group (sea urchins, sea cucumbers and so forth). While all species from the Deuterostomia super-branch are axially symmetrical (right-left) with a so-called anteroposterior distribution (head to tail), the starfish and its relatives are nothing like this. All exhibit five-fold radial symmetry. As for the location of the head and tail, no one knew until now.Researchers from American (Stanford, Berkeley and Columbia), British (Southampton) and Japanese (Okinawa) universities have just unraveled the mystery. ""Basically, we can say that the starfish is just a head,"" summed up Laurent Formery, a French postdoctoral student at Stanford and lead author of the Nature article announcing this result. To establish this, the scientists relied on molecular studies. Where anatomy had hitherto failed, genes have made it possible to draw a conclusion.Formery and his colleagues set out to map gene expression in the animal. Using two cutting-edge techniques – RNA tomography and in situ hybridization – they were able to track the activity of some of these genes and see how the traditional head/trunk/tail distribution observed in bilateral species was reflected in starfish. In fact, the same genes code for these different major body parts throughout living things.Unexpected results emerged. The prevailing hypothesis, that each arm should reproduce the classic head-to-tail unfolding, was overturned. Instead, the researchers observed that the head genes were expressed along the entire length of the animal's arms. Head everywhere, but trunk and tail nowhere. In fact, they found none of the molecular markers associated with those body parts. But by following the genes coding for the different parts of the head, they found the equivalent of an anteroposterior axis, extending from the center to the periphery of each arm.This discovery will enable us to be a little more equipped in diving into two black boxes that were previously hermetically sealed. Firstly, to try to understand how the animal can go from a classically bilateral larval stage to an adult stage with five-fold symmetry. Secondly, to determine its evolution. We know that our common ancestor, some 600 million years ago, was, like us, bilateral. Why and how did echinoderms branch out into this extraordinary form? Formery, who wrote his thesis on sea urchins, is now looking for answers in sea cucumbers.",/en/science/
"Russian ISS segment suffers third leak in under a year, but crew reported safe","    The Nauka module was launched in 2021, and is also known as the Multipurpose Laboratory Module-Upgrade (MLM). ","The Russian segment of the International Space Station (ISS) sprung its third coolant leak in under a year Monday, raising new questions about the reliability of the country's space program even as officials said crew members were not in danger.Flakes of frozen coolant spraying into space were seen in an official live feed of the orbital lab provided by NASA around 1:30 pm Eastern Time (5:30 pm GMT), and confirmed in radio chatter between US mission control and astronauts.""The Nauka module of the Russian segment of the ISS has suffered a coolant leak from the external (backup) radiator circuit, which was delivered to the station in 2012,"" Russian space agency Roscosmos said on Telegram, adding temperatures remained normal in the affected unit. ""Nothing is threatening the crew and the station,"" added the statement.Nauka, which means ""science"" in Russian and is also known as the Multipurpose Laboratory Module-Upgrade (MLM), launched in 2021.US mission control in Houston could be heard asking astronauts on the American side to investigate.""Hi, we're seeing flakes outside, we need a crew to go to the cupola, we think windows five or six, and confirm any visual flakes,"" an official said to the astronauts. ""There's a leak coming from the radiator on MLM,"" NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli replied a little later.NASA later confirmed the events in a statement Monday, saying that ""the crew aboard (the) station was never in any danger,"" and that the leak was coming from Nauka's backup radiator.""The primary radiator on Nauka is working normally, providing full cooling to the module with no impacts to the crew or to space station operations,"" NASA said, adding that the crew ""was asked to close the shutters on US segment windows as a precaution against contamination.""This is the third coolant leak to hit the Russian side of the ISS in less than a year.On December 15, 2022, dramatic NASA TV images showed white particles resembling snowflakes streaming out of the rear of a docked Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft for several hours. Speculation about the cause centered on an unlucky strike by a tiny space rock, or micro meteorite.That spaceship returned to Earth uncrewed, and then another uncrewed Soyuz was sent to replace it a few months later. Two Russians and an American crew had to stay for a year-long mission as a result, returning home only last month.A similar leak in mid-February also affected the Russian Progress MS-21 cargo ship, which had been docked to the ISS since October 2022. The succession of leaks lowers the probability they were caused by meteorites.Space analyst Jonathan McDowell told AFP: ""You've got three coolant systems leaking – there's a common thread there. One is whatever, two is a coincidence, three is something systematic,"" he said, speculating that a subcontractor company may be at fault.""It really just emphasizes the degrading reliability of Russian space systems. When you add it to the context of their failed Moon probe in August, they're not looking great.""The Russian space sector, which has historically been the pride of the country, has been facing difficulties for years, between lack of funding, failures and corruption scandals.The ISS is one of the few areas of cooperation still ongoing between Moscow and Washington since the start of the Russian offensive in Ukraine and the international sanctions that followed.",/en/science/

'Europe's space project has overcome its contradictions and rivalries by reinventing itself at a key moment in its history',"At the close of the European Space Summit in Seville on November 6 and 7, the launcher crisis remains acute. But the Europeans have mapped out the technological and industrial future of Europe's space project with ambitious views on climate and the environment, writes Philippe Baptiste, president of the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, in an op-ed for 'Le Monde.'","The European Space Summit in Seville, which ended on Tuesday, November 7, saw agreement reached on ambitious objectives, notably around the use of space for climate and environmental preservation. It also answered two fundamental questions posed by the French president in Toulouse in 2022: What is Europe's ambition in terms of exploration? What is the future of Europe's Ariane and Vega launchers?Europe is a space leader in Earth observation, with major programs such as Copernicus, which provides valuable satellite data for our environment. For decades, European satellites have been continuously scanning the Earth, and it's thanks to them that we can measure and understand changes in climate, our environment and biodiversity.To provide a concrete response to climate change, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales [CNES] has also created the Space for Climate Observatory. With 44 international partners, we cross-reference space data with in situ observations to produce analysis and simulation tools that enable populations to adapt locally to climate change.We are putting in place simple solutions that enable us, for example, to assess water resources, monitor coastlines and control the risk of coastal flooding. In Seville, Europe made these issues a top political priority, enabling it to maintain its scientific, technical and industrial leadership.The European Union [EU] has also looked at the space race, and Europe's space project has overcome its contradictions and rivalries by reinventing itself at a key moment in its history. At a time when SpaceX is hammering away that its Starship will ""make mankind a multi-planetary species,"" India, meanwhile, has successfully completed the lunar landing of Chandrayaan-3, while China has sent a crew of young astronauts to its space station. These sometimes excessive ambitions are a reminder of the geostrategic stakes inherent in space exploration. What role should Europe play in this race towards what could be a ""new frontier""?Seville marked an important first step towards strengthening Europe's autonomy in exploration. While maintaining strong cooperation with our American partners, Europe needs to catch up and assert its leadership in key segments, starting with control of low-Earth orbit.We'll do this by mobilizing European manufacturers like ArianeGroup or Thales Alenia Space and start-ups like Space Cargo Unlimited or The Exploration Company, which design space capsules. By developing a proactive services purchasing policy, space agencies will help space exploration champions emerge.",/en/science/
"For the first time, a whole eye has been transplanted","    An American team accomplished a partial double transplant of a face and one eye. Five months on, the surgery has been a success, even though the patient's vision has not been restored. ","It's a new step in the history of face transplants. The first partial face and whole eye transplant took place on May 27 at New York Langone University Hospital (NYU) in the United States, the medical team announced at a press conference on Thursday, November 9.The patient, Aaron James, 46, an Arkansas resident and US veteran, was electrocuted in June 2021 by over 7,000 volts while working on a high-voltage line. The accident resulted, among other things, in the loss of his left eye, nose, mouth, chin and teeth, as well as part of his left arm.Supervised by Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, the plastic surgeon in charge of NYU's facial transplant program, the project was conceived as early as August 2022. The ambitious plan mobilized 140 people from all specializations.Since the first face transplant in France in 2005, only 48 face transplants have been performed worldwide, according to a 2021 publication, and eyes have only been involved in partial transplants, mainly of the cornea. The few attempts to transplant a whole eye – some dating back to the 19th century – have failed, one of the main challenges being to reconnect the optic nerve to restore vision.So why try this procedure on James? In recent years, research has made significant progress in the use of immunosuppressive drugs, prescribed for life to avoid transplant rejection. But these drugs are not harmless: beyond the risk of infection, they are also likely to attack the kidneys or accelerate aging. ""Given Aaron needed a face transplant and will be taking immunosuppressive drugs regardless, the risk versus reward ratio of transplanting the eye was very low,"" Rodriguez explained in a press release.After just three months, a compatible donor was identified – size, skin color and biomarkers. To optimize the result, Rodriguez's team used cutting-edge technologies. The Belgian company Materialise, which specializes in 3D planning and the manufacture of made-to-measure medical devices, provided 3D models of the operation to come. It also designed custom 3D-printed cutting guides ""enabling us to take bone segments from the donor and place them precisely on the recipient, like a jigsaw puzzle,"" Rodriguez explained. The titanium screws holding the bones together were supplied by DePuy Synthes, a company owned by Johnson & Johnson.""The team practiced on numerous corpses to create the models and fully rehearse the procedure,"" explained Emily Jones, engineer at Materialise, who was involved in the project. ""On D-Day, we had 24 hours to receive the donor scans, print the custom cutting guides and adjust the surgical plan to the new data.""",/en/science/
France bans wearing Islamic abaya dresses in schools,"    French Education Minister Gabriel Attal justified the decision, citing a violation of French secular laws. The decision has reignited a longstanding debate in France over religious freedom and civil liberties. ","French authorities are to ban the wearing in school premises of abaya dresses worn by some Muslim students, the education minister said Sunday, August 27, arguing the garment violated France's strict secular laws in education.""It will no longer be possible to wear an abaya at school,"" Education Minister Gabriel Attal told TF1 television, saying he would give ""clear rules at the national level"" to school heads ahead of the return to classes nationwide from September 4.The move comes after months of debate over the wearing of abayas in French schools, where girls have long been banned from wearing the Islamic headscarf. The right and far right had pushed for the ban, which the left argued would infringe on civil liberties. There have been reports of abayas being increasingly worn in schools and tensions within schools over the issue between teachers and parents.""Secularism means the freedom to emancipate oneself through school,"" Attal said, describing the abaya as ""a religious gesture, aimed at testing the resistance of the republic toward the secular sanctuary that school must constitute. ""You enter a classroom; you must not be able to identify the students' religion by looking at them,"" he said.A law of March 2004 banned ""the wearing of signs or outfits by which students ostensibly show a religious affiliation"" in schools. This includes large crosses, Jewish kippas, and Islamic headscarves. Unlike headscarves, abayas – a long, baggy garment worn to comply with Islamic beliefs on a modest dress – occupied a grey area and had faced no outright ban until now.However, the education ministry had already issued guidelines on the issue in November last year. It described the abaya as one of a group of clothing items whose wearing could be banned if ""worn in a manner as to display a religious affiliation openly."" The note put bandanas and long skirts in the same category.Approached by head teachers' unions about the issue, Attal's predecessor Pap Ndiaye had said he did not want ""to publish endless catalogs to specify the lengths of dresses.""At least one union leader welcomed Attal's announcement on Sunday. ""The instructions were unclear; now they are, and we welcome it,"" said Bruno Bobkiewicz, general secretary of the NPDEN-UNSA union representing head teachers.The president of the opposition's right-wing Les Républicains party, Eric Ciotti, welcomed the news. ""We called for the ban on abayas in our schools several times,"" he said.Clémentine Autain of the left-wing La France Insoumise party denounced a ""policing of clothing."" She said Attal's announcement was ""unconstitutional"" and against the founding principles of France's secular values.The debate has intensified since a radicalized Chechen refugee beheaded a teacher, Samuel Paty, who had shown students caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad near his school in a Paris suburb in 2020.The Conseil Français du Culte Musulman, a national body encompassing many Muslim associations, said clothing items alone are not ""a religious sign.""The announcement is the first major move by Attal, 34, since he was promoted this summer to handle the hugely contentious education portfolio. Along with Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, 40, he is seen as a rising star who could potentially play an important role after Macron steps down in 2027.",/en/religions/
Ban on abayas in schools reopens the French left's historic split on secularism,"    France's far-left party La France Insoumise has announced its intention to appeal the ban, a government measure supported by some Socialists and the Communists. ","A new bone of contention has inflamed the French left, as Education Minister Gabriel Attal announced on August 27 the abaya would be banned from schools. ""Attacks on secularism have increased considerably,"" he justified, likening this long garment of Middle Eastern origin worn by young Muslim girls to a ""religious garment"" in the same way as the qamis, its equivalent worn by men.That's all it took to revive the divide over secularism on the left. ""Sad to see the start of the new school year politically polarized by yet another absurd and entirely artificial religious war over women's clothing,"" lamented La France Insoumise (LFI, hard-left) leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, calling for ""civil peace"" and ""true secularism that unites rather than exasperates"". LFI coordinator Manuel Bompard announced on French television channel France 2 on Tuesday morning his decision to challenge the ban at the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest administrative court.The line is the antithesis of that taken by the Communists and the Socialist Party (PS), which voted for the 2004 law banning religious symbols in schools. ""Our compass is the ban on ostensible signs in schools,"" retorted Socialist MP Jérôme Guedj, who is in favor of a ban on abayas. ""Secularism is, along with Europe, the most divisive issue on the left,"" political scientist Rémi Lefebvre pointed out. ""A large portion of the PS sticks to a fairly strict secularism and part of LFI and the ecologists have a more accommodating conception of it in the name of defending minorities – and well-understood electoral interests,"" according to Jérôme Fourquet, director of the Opinion department at IFOP, the French institute of public opinion.""As soon as the abaya or qamis are worn in an ostentatious way, they should be banned, as the 2004 law allows, without any major difficulties,"" said Guedj, drawing the wrath of MP Nadège Abomangoli (LFI). ""A European list with this? No thanks,"" she replied on X (formerly Twitter) referring to the June 2024 European elections.At the heart of the controversy is whether or not the clothing is religious. For Guedj, who urges his partners on the left to ""not be angelic,"" there is no doubt. ""There are people with a political project to challenge secularism,"" he says. It was therefore necessary to ""send out a clear message in the face of a phenomenon that didn't exist a few years ago"" and which is growing. In one year, breaches of secularism have increased by 120 % between the 2022-2023 school year and the previous one, according to a note from state services quoted by Le Monde on August 28. ""School principals were asking for support,"" justified the elected official.",/en/religions/
"'Religious freedom is real in Mongolia, despite an alliance between Buddhism and the government'","    As Pope Francis visits Mongolia, which boasts one of the world's smallest Catholic communities,  anthropologist Grégory Delaplace analyzes the stakes of his trip through the prism of the country's religious situation. ","Pope Francis will be in Mongolia from Thursday, August 31, until Monday, September 4. This is the first visit by a pope to this East Asian country, which boasts one of the world's smallest Catholic communities, with only some 1,500 followers out of a population of three million. Situated between Russia, of which it was a satellite at the time of the Soviet Union, and China, its main trading partner, Mongolia is an important diplomatic intermediary for the Holy See.But this former Soviet country also represents a high-potential mission land for Francis, who intends to put the Church's ""outskirts"" back in the spotlight. In August 2022, the Pope made the Italian missionary Giorgio Marengo – the apostolic prefect of Oulan-Bator, the Mongolian capital – a cardinal, which, at 48, made him the world's youngest. But is there really room for the development of Catholicism in Mongolia? In an interview with Le Monde, anthropologist Grégory Delaplace analyzed the country's religious landscape, which has been constantly reshaped by the upheavals of history.The most present and influential religion is undoubtedly the Gelug school of Buddhism, known as the ""yellow hat"" school – in reference to the color of the clothing worn by monks and dignitaries. This is the school of which the Dalai Lama is the highest representative, a fact which has led to recurrent tensions with China.Between 1921 and 1924, before the establishment of a socialist republic based on the Soviet model, Mongolia was even a veritable theocracy for a few years, ruled by a high dignitary of Gelug Buddhism. The influence of the Buddhist clergy was considerable. Benefiting from substantial donations, monasteries were not only rich and powerful places but also major centers of intellectual production. What's more, every family was required to send one child to a monastery. There was talk of a state within the state, which the socialist regime could not tolerate. This led to massive repression of the clergy in the 1930s.Today, monks are fewer in number and less powerful, but still very much present. The country's entire religious life is structured by Buddhist liturgy. During the Lunar New Year, for example, many Mongolians continue to visit monasteries to prepare for the coming year, find out about potential obstacles to prosperity, find out whether they'll be lucky, what they should avoid doing, perform rituals to compensate for unfavorable astrological configurations, and more.",/en/religions/
Pope to meet tiny Catholic community of Mongolia,    Francis' visit from September 1 to September 4 marks the desert country's first-ever visit from a pontiff. The nation's geographical situation – sandwiched between Russia and China – could be the reason the Vatican wants to put it on its map. ,"Virtually nobody could believe it when the news began circulating back in December 2022. Why would Pope Francis visit Mongolia, a country no pontiff ever visited before? The country's history and heritage are certainly legendary, since the time of Genghis Khan, who founded an empire stretching from China to the eastern fringes of Europe, and whose influence is still felt today. Relations between the Holy See and the Mongol nation date back to 1246, when Innocent IV sent an emissary to Karakorum, then the capital of the Mongol Empire. However, on the eve of the 43rd apostolic visit undertaken by 86-year-old Pope Francis from September 1 to 4, many observers are still at pains to explain this long journey.The world's least densely populated country has a small Catholic community, with just under 1,400 faithful out of a population of 3.3 million. But no matter. Instead of putting Western nations at the center of his geography, Francis, according to a Vatican diplomatic source, has chosen to visit the world's outer reaches, to which he wishes to give as much if not more importance than to the ""major"" Catholic countries.In August 2022, Francis appointed Giorgio Marengo, an Italian missionary and now apostolic prefect of Ulaanbaatar, the current capital of Mongolia, to the position of cardinal. At the age of 49, Marengo is the youngest elector in the body that will, in due course, elect the next pope. This gesture comes at a time when Mongolian Catholics are too few in number to have their own diocese. Another argument in favor of a papal visit is the country's tradition of religious tolerance, which the head of the Catholic Church will no doubt highlight in his speeches. An ecumenical and interfaith meeting is scheduled for Sunday, September 3.A third and main argument is the position occupied by this immense desert country, although not one mentioned prominently in the Vatican. The only parliamentary democracy in the region, Mongolia lies between two authoritarian regimes at the heart of the Vatican's concerns, namely Russia and China, with which Pope Francis would like to develop a more direct relationship. In September 2022, he visited Kazakhstan, hoping to meet Kirill, the patriarch of Moscow, to discuss the war in Ukraine. The Orthodox leader, who is close to Vladimir Putin and has described Russian aggression as a ""fight against the forces of evil,"" never showed up.No one knows whether Francis will take advantage of his trip to Mongolia (a decision taken after the invasion of Ukraine) to try and send a message to the Russians. Routinely criticized for his positions, which never fail to embrace Russia and place the aggressor and victim on an equal footing, Francis once again provoked the anger of Ukrainians on August 25. In a televised address to the Russian Youth Days held in St. Petersburg, the pontiff encouraged young people to be the ""heirs of the great Russia of Peter the Great and Catherine II,"" and praised the Empire's great culture and humanity, which many have seen as an expression of admiration for Russian imperialism.",/en/religions/
Charlie Hebdo's lawyer: 'Penalizing Quran burnings means embarking on an extraordinarily dangerous path',"With Denmark planning to ban the public desecration of religious objects, Richard Malka protests against the country bowing to pressure from regimes such as Syria and Iran, which have little respect for human rights.","This is not happening in 17th century Denmark, but today. In 2023, progressive Denmark, the flower of European social democracy, will reinstate (while claiming otherwise) the crime of blasphemy − with imprisonment a possible punishment.Ironically, this medieval offense was removed from the Danish penal code just six years ago after a lengthy debate, putting an end to a 344-year ban on offending God. According to the justice minister, this U-turn is justified by national security imperatives. We're talking about the crisis of the Quran burnings, the latest season of the clash of civilizations, written by bad screenwriters. And since we never learn from the past, we fall for it, to the point of folly. It's not the trap set by a few activists that's maddening – we'll never be able to prevent that – but the lack of reflection, memory, perspective and moderation on the part of so many heads of state and religious dignitaries.Over the past few months, two Iraqi political refugees in Sweden, who claim to be atheists, have been carrying out spectacular Quran burnings in the presence of the press. They threaten to continue their desecrations, which have included trampling on the sacred book and inserting slices of bacon in its pages, until the Quran, which they consider ""more dangerous than nuclear weapons,"" is banned. At the very least, they call for the removal of ""the verses on murder."" But when it comes down to it, it doesn't really matter what their motives are.Far-right parties in Sweden and Denmark followed suit. These two countries, whose authorities have firmly condemned the Quran burners, were met with an avalanche of threatening rebukes. These came from regimes with leaders who seem to believe that if a person who expresses a transgressive opinion is not immediately burned (as in Pakistan), hanged (Iran) or beheaded ( Saudi Arabia), the country where they live must share their opinion. Accepting this insane logic, Denmark – and perhaps soon Sweden, which has repeatedly banned public burnings of the Quran this year – is proposing legislation to punish the ""improper treatment of objects of significant religious importance to a religious community"" with two years of imprisonment and a fine. It is as if thought had finally given in to religious pressure.Let's overlook the inclusion, obviously just for show, of Catholics and Jews in this affair. No doubt, they too feel wounded by the burning of their holy books, but we have no recollection of notable representatives of these religions calling for the imprisonment of the perpetrators of such acts. The second act of hypocrisy consists in claiming that the legislation would not restore the offense of blasphemy, since it is specified that ""verbal or written expression"" would not be covered by the law. Blasphemy can just as easily be committed by word, writing, drawing or gesture − such a distinction makes no sense.",/en/religions/
Violent riot breaks out in Sweden at Koran burning protest,"    Sunday's protest was held in a square in the southern city of Malmo, which has a large immigrant population. Swedish police arrested two people and detained around 10 people after the riot broke out. ","Swedish police on Sunday, September 3, arrested two people and detained around 10 people after a violent riot broke out at a protest involving a burning of the Koran, police said.The protest was organized by Iraqi refugee Salwan Momika, whose protests – which have included public desecrations of the Muslim holy book – have sparked outrage across the Middle East.Sunday's protest was held in a square in the southern city of Malmo, which has a large immigrant population, and according to public broadcaster SVT around 200 people had showed up to watch. ""Some onlookers have shown upset feelings after the organizer burned writings,"" police said in a statement. ""The mood was at times heated,"" the statement said, adding that a ""violent riot"" occurred at 1:45 pm.According to police, the event had ended after the organizer left but a group of people remained at the scene. About 10 people were detained for disturbing the public order and another two were arrested, suspected of violent rioting.Local media reported that some onlookers threw rocks at Momika, and video from the scene showed some trying to break through the cordon before being stopped by police. In another video a man could be seen trying to stop the police car that transported Momika from the location by getting in front of it.Through a series of demonstrations, Momika has sparked anger directed at Sweden and diplomatic tensions between Sweden and several Middle Eastern countries.The Swedish government has condemned the desecrations of the Koran while noting the country's constitutionally protected freedom of speech and assembly laws.Iraqi protesters stormed the Swedish embassy in Baghdad twice in July, starting fires within the compound on the second occasion.Swedish envoys have also been summoned in a slew of Middle Eastern nations.In mid-August, Sweden's intelligence agency heightened its terror alert level to four on a scale of five, noting that Sweden had ""gone from being considered a legitimate target for terrorist attacks to being considered a prioritized target.""",/en/religions/
Brazil's Serra da Capivara cave paintings are under threat,Feature,"Was prehistory a party? Judging by the cave paintings in Brazil's Serra da Capivara, we'd be tempted to say yes. On fragile arenite walls, human figures frolic amid deer, armadillos, crabs and rodents. Some appear to be dancing and swaying, forming cheerful pyramids, arms outstretched to the sky. Others, their phalluses erect, are in the midst of a sexual act.Seen from here, in the state of Piaui, on the edge of the Nordeste region, everything seems lovely and voluptuous. At first glance, the Serra da Capivara National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site and archaeological jewel of the Americas, conjures up a vision of blissful effervescence, with its more than 1,000 sites of cave paintings and engravings dating back 6,000 to 12,000 years. Hence its well-deserved nickname of the ""Brazilian Lascaux.""While the scenes depicted are open to infinite interpretation, their artistic value is not up for debate. As in a cinema, everything here is movement: Characters run and leap and styles intermingle, from ochre pigment (from hematite, an iron oxide) to milky white (from gypsum). The technique used to fix them to the rock remains a mystery. Some researchers suspect the use of a mixture of animal fat, sap and even saliva and blood.But the Capivara is much more than an open-air gallery of prehistoric art. It's also a 130,000-hectare environmental reserve, crisscrossed by glowing canyons and carpeted by the Caatinga, meaning ""white forest"" in the indigenous Tupi language, an ecosystem of thorny brush and leafless shrubs. Snakes and rodents, giant anteaters and spotted jaguars roam between the frescoes.Everything is done to attract tourists: perfectly groomed trails, wooden platforms, disabled access, nighttime illuminations and themed signage. There were 16,000 vistors in the first quarter, 35% more than in 2022. Two weekly flights reach the nearby town of Sao Raimundo Nonato and its airport in the (approximate) shape of a capivara (capybara), the huge, placid rodent that gives the park its name.And that's not all: The remote Serra da Capivara is home to six research laboratories and a campus of the Federal University of the Sao Francisco Valley (UNIVASF), which offers several master's degrees. It is also the location of a number of cultural institutions, including the very modern spiral-shaped Nature Museum, which traces the biological history of the planet. Cycling races, hiking trails and even opera concerts are organized between the canyons.",/en/science/
"In Mongolia, Pope Francis asks Chinese Catholics to be 'good citizens'","    The head of the Catholic Church addressed the faithful of Mongolia's neighboring country after a mass on Sunday, the penultimate day of his visit to Ulaanbaatar. ","On the field hockey rink of Ulaanbaatar's Steppe Arena, an impressive wooden cross stood on the red stage. Stylized Mongolian-style flowers adorned the sculpture. In their purple outfits and straw hats, young girls, who came especially from Vietnam, awaited the arrival of Pope Francis on stage. In the blue and yellow bleachers, the faithful from several Asian countries attended the mass celebrated by the head of the Catholic Church on Sunday, September 3, as part of his apostolic visit to Mongolia, a country whose 1,400 Catholics were insufficient in number to fill the 2,000 seats in the stadium.It was China, which shares 4,677 kilometers of border with Mongolia, that the pontiff was thinking of on Sunday, more than any other Asian nations represented in the audience. During his traditional popemobile tour before mass, the Argentine pope stopped in front of a large Chinese flag held by the faithful who had come to meet him from their home country. An hour and a half later, at the end of mass, the standing pope gave one hand to Cardinal-designate Stephen Chow, bishop of Hong Kong, and the other to Chow's predecessor, Cardinal John Tong. With the two prelates at his side, the pontiff addressed the Chinese faithful, and no doubt also the country's government: ""I would like to take this opportunity, in the presence of these two brother bishops (...), to send a heartfelt greeting to the noble Chinese people. (...) I ask Chinese Catholics to be good Christians and good citizens.""In China, Catholics are tightly controlled and even repressed by the authorities. To improve their situation, the Vatican under Francis has endeavored to find common ground with the Beijing government. In 2018, the two sides reached an agreement – renewed twice since – whose letter remains secret ,but which institutes a shared procedure for appointing bishops. Its aim is to bring closer together the official Church, whose hierarchs were appointed by Beijing, and the underground Church, whose prelates were chosen by Rome.Since his election, Francis has also repeatedly expressed his desire to be able to visit China, and has offered Bejing signs of his willingness to do so. His recommendation to the country's faithful to be ""good citizens"" fits into this framework. ""The idea is to reassure the Chinese government that Catholics are not destined to become dissidents,"" said Michel Chambon, a researcher at the Asia Research Institute, University of Singapore. The Vatican sees Chow, recently appointed cardinal, as a bridge between Rome and Beijing. The prelate visited the Chinese capital in April and is due to return soon. However, without authorization from Beijing, no Chinese Catholic prelate could travel to Mongolia for Francis' visit.",/en/religions/
French satirical newspaper 'Charlie Hebdo' blasts proposed Danish blasphemy law,"    The French satirical weekly magazine is leading a protest against the return of a more than 300-year-old law, denouncing it as a regressive move influenced by authoritarian regimes and a threat to freedom of expression. ","Charlie Hebdo is back on crusading for freedom of expression. While the Danish government presented a bill to Parliament on Friday, September 1, banning public defacing of religious objects, the secular satirical French weekly is criticizing Copenhagen's decision to reinstate the crime of blasphemy. The subject will feature on the front page of the Wednesday, September 6, issue.The newspaper is launching an appeal to ""warn citizens committed to democratic values"" alongside eight Scandinavian media outlets. Among them, seven Norwegian newspapers and online sites and one Danish media outlet are criticizing the return of this 334-year-old law, which was repealed in 2017.In recent months, there has been one controversy after another in northern Europe, with Iraqi political refugees repeatedly burning Qurans in front of the press. The Scandinavian far right is exultant at other similar degradations carried out within its ranks. The emotion that swept through the Muslim world at these images of book burning led, for example, to a hundred people attacking the Swedish embassy in Baghdad on July 20.Against this backdrop of heightened tensions, Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard has championed a law designed to ""prohibit the inappropriate treatment of objects of significant religious significance to a religious community."" Anyone publicly desecrating a Bible, Torah, Quran or religious symbols such as a crucifix will soon face a fine or up to two years imprisonment.For the editorial staff of Charlie Hebdo, who were targeted by an Islamist attack on January 7, 2015, this ""ad hoc legislation"" is worrying. ""It's serious that a European country should decide to reinstate a medieval offense,"" warned the publication's director, Riss, who sees it as all the more symbolically important given that Denmark was the scene of the Muhammad cartoons affair in 2005.""In doing this, the Danish government is bowing to pressure from Muslim countries,"" complained Gérard Biard, the weekly's editor-in-chief. ""With this scandalous law, the Danish government is being dictated to by authoritarian regimes such as Iran, Saudi Arabia and Taliban Afghanistan. The vagueness surrounding this bill, which in reality concerns only the Quran, leaves the door open to all interpretations and therefore all penalties,"" even though the Danish minister of justice has assured that the law will not cover cartoons.By embarking on this new battle, and at the risk of being accused of encouraging book-burners, Charlie Hebdo will surprise neither its supporters nor its detractors. ""We're not trying to export French-style secularism but to support freedom of expression, which is threatened by this law. Everyone has the right to practise their religion, it's not about the Quran, it's about fighting religious fundamentalism,"" Riss said. The newspaper is currently in difficulty. Only 17,000 copies were sold on newsstands per week in August, compared with 20,000 in January 2023 and 25,000 in May 2022. Subscribers still hover around 30,000, but this is 3,000 fewer than nine months ago, and 7,000 fewer than in May 2022.",/en/religions/
Pope Francis admits that 'taking a trip now is not as easy as in the beginning',"    During the return journey to Rome following his visit to Mongolia, Pope Francis suggested that he might soon stop traveling internationally. ","Recognizing the impacts of aging and the physical constraints it imposes can be particularly challenging, especially for a head of state or religious leader. But that's exactly what Pope Francis did on Monday, September 4, on the plane back to Rome after visiting Mongolia.When asked by the press about his future travel plans, the Pope brought up his physical abilities and how their limitation may impact the rest of his time in office. ""To tell the truth, for me going on a journey now is not as easy as it was in the beginning. There are difficulties with walking and that limits me,"" he said. The Argentinian pope has been suffering from knee pain since May 2022, forcing him to use a wheelchair. The man who has ventured across the globe, even visiting ""peripheral"" countries, half-heartedly admitted on Monday that he would be traveling very little at best.Referring to his upcoming visit to Marseille for the Mediterranean Days on September 22 and 23, Francis hinted that he might also visit ""a small European country."" Rumors of a trip to Kosovo have been circulating in the Vatican for several months. But even this remains highly uncertain, as the Pope, who will turn 87 in December, seems quite tired. ""We are seeing if we can do it,"" he explained.There was no mention of trips, despite recently mentioning them himself, to India, Argentina, Indonesia or East Timor. He hinted that the few days spent in Mongolia with the local Catholic community and its dynamic bishop, Cardinal Giorgio Marengo, would be his last in a distant country, if not his final trip abroad.When asked about a visit to Vietnam, the Pope joked, ""If I don't go, surely John XXIV will go,"" referring to his possible successor. For several months now, the health of Pope Francis, who has been hospitalized twice, has raised questions. This admission, which gives the impression that the Pope is aware of his physical limitations, could reignite speculation about a potential resignation.During his trip to Mongolia, where Chinese followers were present at every stop, Pope Francis also addressed the issue of Catholics in China, who are under strict control by the regime. The previous day he called on them to be ""good citizens."" When asked about this statement, the Pope expressed that it was necessary to make China understand that Catholics were not engaged in a political endeavor, but solely a religious one. He explained, ""I think we need to move forward in the religious aspect to understand each other better and so that Chinese citizens do not think that the Church does not accept their culture and values and that the Church is dependent on another, foreign power.""",/en/religions/
In defense of the delicate balance of French secularism,The government's ban on abayas and khamis cannot be summed up as a simple diversionary tactic to mask problems in the education system. Secularism deserves to be defended as a guarantee of concrete freedoms for all.,"A simple item of clothing or a symbol of Islamism? Protecting religious freedom or being able to live alongside one another? Political instrumentalization or a core societal issue? These questions are still shaking up French society, ever since three pupils were expelled from a secondary school in Creil, a northern Paris suburb, 34 years ago for wearing the Islamic headscarf. Now the issue is once again at the heart of public debate, after the French Minister of Education Gabriel Attal announced a ban on the abaya, the long body-covering dress worn by some Muslim women, on August 27. The memo he has sent to school principals states that wearing it falls within the scope of a 2004 law banning ""the wearing of symbols or outfits through which pupils ostensibly show a religious affiliation"" in public schools.In 2003, the Stasi Commission, set up by then-president Jacques Chirac to examine the issue, decided to call for legislation for two main reasons: the testimonies of young Muslim women calling for a law to protect them against religious pressure and the use of the Islamic headscarf as an instrument of geopolitical influence.Two decades later, these two ideas have only been confirmed: There have been attempts by religious figures to impose religious rules in certain neighborhoods alongside intensive use of social media. After the terrible series of terrorist attacks in 2012-2016, the assassination of teacher Samuel Paty in 2020 was a tragic reminder of how central the education system is to Islamists' strategies. As these events unfolded, the issue of secularism became an increasingly divisive political tool.Today, however, the abaya ban cannot be summed up as a simple diversionary tactic by the government to mask the difficulties facing the school system. Many people in the education sector have called for a clear, national standard, justified by an upsurge in ""attacks on secularism."" The measure is certainly a way for the minister to make his mark in his new role − but it is also a way for him to assume his responsibilities.Opponents of the ban have referred the issue to the Conseil d'Etat, the country's highest administrative court, which will judge whether it complies with the 2004 law. The 2004 law on secularism was originally written to cover ""ostensibly"" religious garments, but also to respect the principle of the European Convention on Human Rights, which says that freedom of religion can only be restricted for reasons linked to the ""protection of public order (...) or of the rights and freedoms of others"".The need to preserve this fragile balance and to protect both pupils and teachers from religious pressures and quarrels should guide political leaders, particularly those on the left, for whom secularism has long been a central marker. Isn't there a contradiction between some people's denial of the religious character of the abaya − even though many Muslims see it as such − and these same people's accusation that the ban is Islamophobic? The concept of secularism deserves to be more widely taught as a historical achievement rather than an abstract theory. It also deserves to be defended, certainly not as a means of discrimination, but as a guarantee of concrete freedoms for all, in particular the right of women and men to choose and live their identity independently.",/en/religions/
"Muslim rights group appeals France's abaya ban in schools, bringing debate to highest court",    An organization filed an appeal after the government banned the wearing of abayas and khamis in public schools. The country's highest administrative court held the hearing on Tuesday. ,"The debate over the wearing of abayas in France's schools took a two-hour detour to the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest administrative court, in Paris on Tuesday, September 5. Two hours passed with tense, passionate, and sometimes messy discussions before the court. An appeal was filed by the lawyers William Bourdon and Vincent Brengarth acting on behalf of the Action Droits des Musulmans (Action Rights of Muslims, ADM) organization, formed in 2015 to fight against measures deemed Islamophobic. It called for the suspension of the Ministry of Education's memorandum banning the wearing of abayas and khamis in schools.A total of five Ministry of Education representatives were present for the defense. However, only Guillaume Odinet, director of legal affairs, spoke on behalf of the government. Aside from Sihem Zine, the founder of ADM, and a judge, who did not speak but assisted the summary proceedings hearing president, this judicial debate on clothing worn by young Muslim women was only attended by men.Two things must be demonstrated for an appeal to be accepted: The urgency to act due to prejudice and a serious and manifestly illegal infringement of fundamental rights. Both parties vigorously debated these points under the watchful eye of Pierre Collin, who often attempted to put the discussions back on track. The Jeunesse France Harcèlement, an organization dedicated to fighting harassment and cyberbullying, which had sought to join the appeal prior to the debates, had their submission ruled inadmissible due to a lack of legal interest.In his argument, Brengarth focused on the fact that the government had made a major policy change by banning the abaya entirely from schools the day before the start of the new school year. It was a change from the last school year when the ban was left to the discretion of the heads of each school. There's therefore an urgent need to rule on the matter in order to avoid the exclusion of dozens, if not hundreds, of students. During his response to the defense brief, the lawyer cited several cases of young girls who were banned from class on the first day of the school year, as reported by the ADM association on Monday evening.As far as the Ministry of Education is concerned, the August 31 memorandum, accompanied by a letter explaining its content and approach to parents, is nothing more than a revision to a 2004 law prohibiting ostentatious religious symbols in schools, including symbols such as the hijab, yarmulke and disproportionately sized crosses. The defense believes that there is no new issue to debate and that the memorandum simply clarifies the application of existing law in response to a request from the heads of schools. As a result of the phenomenal rise of the wearing of the abaya as a Muslim and community marker in schools, Odinet said his ministry's monthly survey indicates an explosion of violations of secularism. The national education lawyer cites a previous decree by the Conseil d'État prohibiting the wearing of permanent bandanas in place of headscarves as support for his argument.",/en/religions/
Wearing the abaya to school: Who in France opposes the ban?,"    Activists from the Muslim sphere are opposed to the garment's ban, denouncing it as discriminatory and arbitrary or claiming that every woman has the right to control her own body. ","Elias d'Imzalène met with us not far from his home, in a rather stuffy Versailles tearoom. The customers included well-off young patrons and a number of well-dressed old ladies. There was not an abaya in sight. With his long, untrimmed beard, d'Imzalène stood out. But, as a true Versaillais, he was wearing a blazer with gold buttons and had an elegant leather satchel. His sophisticated chignon and rimless glasses completed a look that was hard to categorize – like his ideas.Since the announcement of the ban on wearing the abaya in French schools, d'Imzalène, founder of the now dormant site Islam & Info, has been one of the most active and virulent voices on X (formerly Twitter) to mobilize people against a ban he considers Islamophobic. The 40-something, who describes himself as a ""community influencer and political Muslim,"" prefers the label ""Islamian"" to ""Islamist.""As far as the abaya is concerned, he's not for it per se, but he's vehemently against banning it. Not so much in the name of his religious values but because of each woman's right to control her own body. ""In Islam, there is no clergy; it's up to each woman to decide what to wear, including the veil,"" he noted. ""The abaya is a reflection of those who wear it and also the result of the influence of TikTok, fashion, the desire to be noticed..."" His criticism of the abaya ban is that it ""defines secularism, and ultimately Frenchness, as the antithesis of Islam, as if an enemy was needed to exist.""Since the Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) was dissolved by decree in the fall of 2020, d'Imzalène has been one of the community's most vocal voices on this issue, but he is far from alone. Political scientist Gilles Kepel calls them ""entrepreneurs of anger.""For d'Imzalène, the ban on the abaya in schools will not pass like the ban on the headscarf in 2004: ""The country itself has changed, it's mixed. We are this country, too. We saw it with the riots that followed the death of Nahel M. [a 17-year-old killed by a policeman during a traffic stop on June 27]. There is a segment of Muslim youth who no longer want to remain silent and bow their heads. This generation isn't asking for its rights, it's exercising them.""In France, it's hard to find any religious authority or community leader explicitly advocating the wearing of the abaya in schools. In the Muslim sphere, people are instead mobilizing against its ban, following the example of Feiza Ben Mohamed, French correspondent for the official Turkish agency Anadolu and a polemicist, who, on Sunday, September 3, posted on her X account: ""Happy back-to-school to all our little sisters who will be returning to class tomorrow, in the outfit of their choice. Be proud of who you are and don't let anyone make you think you're sub-citizens.""",/en/religions/
French court upholds abaya ban in public schools,"    Last month, President Emmanuel Macron's government made headlines by announcing a ban on the traditional over-garments worn by some Muslim women in schools, citing violations of educational secularism rules. ","France's top administrative court on Thursday, September 7, upheld a government ban on traditional over-garments worn by some Muslim women in schools and rejected complaints it was discriminatory and could incite hatred. President Emmanuel Macron's government announced last month it was banning the abaya in schools as it broke the rules on secularism in education. Muslim headscarves have already been banned on the grounds that they constitute a display of religious affiliation.An association representing Muslims filed a motion with the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest court for complaints against state authorities, for an injunction against the ban on the abaya and the qamis, its equivalent dress for men. The association said the ban was discriminatory and could incite hatred against Muslims, as well as racial profiling.But after examining the motion – filed by the Action for the Rights of Muslims (ADM) – for two days, the Conseil d'Etat rejected the arguments. It said wearing the abaya ""follows the logic of religious affirmation,"" adding that the decision was based on French law which did not allow anyone to wear visible signs of any religious affiliation in schools.The ban by the government did not, it said, cause ""serious or obviously illegal harm to the respect for personal lives, freedom of religion, the right to education, the well-being of children or the principle of non-discrimination.""Ahead of the ruling, France's Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM), established to represent Muslims before the government, had warned that banning the abaya could create ""an elevated risk of discrimination"" and said it was considering putting its own complaint before the Conseil d'Etat.The absence of ""a clear definition of this garment creates vagueness and legal uncertainty,"" it said. ADM's lawyer, Vincent Brengarth, argued during the court hearing that the abaya should be considered a traditional garment, not a religious one. He also accused the government of seeking political advantage with the ban. ADM president Sihem Zine said the rule was ""sexist"" because it singles out girls and ""targets Arabs.""But the Education Ministry said the abaya made its wearers ""immediately recognizable as belonging to the Muslim religion"" and therefore ran counter to France's secular culture. French schools sent dozens of girls home for refusing to remove their abayas – a shoulder-to-toe over-garment – on the first day of the school year on Monday. Nearly 300 schoolgirls defied the ban, Education Minister Gabriel Attal said. Most agreed to change garments but 67 refused and were sent home, he said.In 2016 the Conseil d'Etat overturned a ban in a French Riviera resort against the burkini, saying it failed to see any threat to public order from the long bathing suit worn by some Muslim women. Around 10% of France's 67 million inhabitants are Muslim, according to official estimates. Most have origins in northern African countries Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which were French colonies until the second half of the 20th century.",/en/religions/
Abaya ban in French schools: 'Wearing the abaya is a political gesture',"Iannis Roder, a history and geography teacher, agrees with French Education Minister Gabriel Attal's ban on abaya dresses in public schools. He says that the abaya is traditionally worn in order to conform to the religious norms set out by Islamists.","The law of March 15, 2004, prohibits pupils from wearing any conspicuous symbols or clothing that manifest a religious affiliation. It was in the application of this law that Education Minister Gabriel Attal said that ""abayas could no longer be worn at school."" While the appearance of this garment was noted back in 2010 in a few schools in the northern Paris suburb Seine-Saint-Denis, it's only recently that it has been widely worn.So as not to fall foul of the law, some students have argued that wearing the abaya has no religious significance but is simply a dress worn ""culturally and not religiously."" In Lille, Nice and Toulouse, girls are being schooled to use the same argument and language and are simply repeating Islamist rhetoric aimed at undermining the French Republic's education system, which represents a danger for political Islam, as it offers access to individual freedom through knowledge.Wearing the abaya is not religious? Online stores offering ""Islamic clothing"" or ""for Muslim women"" suggest otherwise. In fact, the abaya is commonly worn to comply with religious norms that require women to be ""modest"" and by extension, ""virtuous."" The concept belittles women, who are deemed inherently impure and are expected to conceal their forms – just as the hijab conceals their hair – from the gaze of men, at the risk of arousing their contempt, anger and even violence.The situation of women in Iran and Afghanistan is a daily reminder of this: Not only how the control of women's bodies and dress policing are established, but also how Islamism is gradually sliding Islam toward rigid norms, leading some French young people to believe that certain practices are Muslim when in fact, they are Islamist.Wearing the abaya is part of this logic, as it is a political gesture more consistent with wearing a uniform than simply a fashion statement: the dress differentiates women and gives them recognition, but at the same time they are submitting to rules of conduct whose philosophy is foreign to that of the Republic's education system. It symbolizes belonging to a community, and if it is difficult for some to remove it, it is because they would be breaking the rules, which are sometimes understood as absolute. Moreover, could an ordinary garment give rise to the outburst that followed the announcement of its ban on social media?The political dimension is also brought home to France by the appearance of Abdelhakim Sefrioui in 2011 – a disquieting figure at the heart of what led to the murder of Samuel Paty – who, during the first incidents linked to the wearing of abayas in a high school in Saint-Ouen, in the northern suburbs of Paris, posed as the uncle of one of the students in order to put pressure on the principal. At the time, the girls said they wore the garment voluntarily, and many of them today tirelessly repeat: ""It's my choice.""",/en/religions/
Abaya ban in French schools: Top court gives government legal boost,"    On Thursday, the Conseil d'Etat rejected the appeal lodged by a Muslim rights organization. Other appeals are underway. ","This is only the first decision in what promises to be a legal trench war, and it is in favor of the French government, particularly Education Minister Gabriel Attal. The Conseil d'Etat, France's top administrative court, rejected the appeal lodged by the Action Droits des Musulmans (Action for the Rights of Muslims, ADM) association, calling for the suspension of the ban on abayas and khamis in schools, laid down in a memorandum dated August 31.In an emergency session, the administrative judge ruled that the ban on these garments in public schools did not violate fundamental freedoms and did not cause ""serious or obviously illegal harm to the respect for personal lives, freedom of religion, the right to education, the well-being of children or the principle of non-discrimination."" In the opinion of the judge, ""the abaya follows the logic of religious affirmation, as is clear from the comments made during discussions with students."" Its prohibition therefore falls within the scope of the 2004 law banning conspicuous religious symbols in schools.The ADM association's appeal was the subject of a two-hour hearing on Tuesday, September 5, before the Paris court. In his decision, the judge recalled the figures quoted at the hearing by the Education Ministry's director of legal affairs, Guillaume Odinet. There were 1,984 reports of breaches of secularism in schools for 2022-2023, the vast majority of which related to the wearing of abayas, compared with 617 during the previous school year.Similarly, the judge repeated the definition of the abaya given at the hearing by the ministry's representative: ""A woman's garment covering the whole body except for the face and hands."" He continued, ""The wearing of this type of clothing, which cannot be regarded as discreet, constitutes an overt demonstration of the religious affiliation of the students in question."" He went on to point out that this is prohibited by the government's instructions on how to apply the 2004 law banning Islamic head scarves and other religious symbols from public schools.""The court has not addressed our arguments and is simply repeating those of the Ministry [of Education], without demonstrating the religious nature or addressing the absence of a definition [of what an abaya is],"" said Vincent Brengarth, the lawyer for Action Droits des Musulmans, on Thursday. Conversely, Minister Attal hailed on X (formerly Twitter) ""an important ruling for the republic's schools,"" which must ""welcome all students, with the same rights and the same duties, without discrimination or stigmatization.""",/en/religions/
French secularism: Education minister to ban abayas in public schools,    Reports of breaches of secularism have increased over the past year in France. The new Minister of Education intends to clarify a situation that his predecessor had left partly up to the discretion of school heads. ,"Gabriel Attal has made up his mind. France's minister of education has ""decided it will no longer be possible to wear an abaya at school,"" he announced on the TF1 evening news, on Sunday, August 27. This was a ""necessary and fair rule,"" he said, adding: ""When you enter a classroom, you must not be able to identify the religion of pupils by looking at them."" Attal had already issued a firm instruction to the regional heads of education he met with on Thursday: ""Wherever the Republic is tested, we must stand together,"" he told them.For almost a year, principals and school directors confronted with pupils wearing abayas (long Middle Eastern dresses worn over other garments) or qamis (long tunics for men) have been asking for ""clear instructions"" as to whether or not such garments ostensibly manifest a religious affiliation, contrary to the March 2004 law banning religious symbols in schools. In a confidential memo, France's Council of Advisors for Secularism and the Values of the Republic advocated taking a firm stand as early as June 2022, ""anxious not to once again leave management staff to their own devices,"" said Alain Seksig, the body's general secretary.But former education minister Pap Ndiaye did not want to make a decision. In November 2022, he issued a circular to ""guide"" school princiapls and to explain the steps to be taken to help them to make up their own minds. This was an issue that is also being debated within the Muslim community itself. The French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) asserted in June that the abaya ""is not a Muslim religious symbol"" and that ""in the Muslim tradition (...), a garment of any kind is not a religious symbol in itself.""The margin of interpretation Ndiaye left to school principals may have led some to prohibit such clothing and others to authorize it. ""We don't want to be the arbiters of uncertainty. This could potentially put us in danger, as we stand at the gates of our establishments every morning,"" emphasized Didier Georges, school principal and national secretary of the SNPDEN-UNSA teachers' union.Over the past year, reports of breaches of secularism have only increased. They are up 120% between the 2022-2023 school year and the previous one (4,710 vs. 2,167), according to a memo from the state services, a copy of which was obtained by Le Monde. Between April and June, the number of protests amounted to 1,892. This is an unprecedented figure since the introduction of this count in 2018, to be considered against the 12 million pupils in France last year.",/en/religions/
Abaya ban in French schools: 'The government does not understand the boomerang effect of coercive laws',The sociologist Agnès De Féo warns that banning the abaya dress from schools could prove counterproductive.,"The return to school this year has seen yet another controversy concerning Muslim dress for women. The abaya is set to become a national cause since Gabriel Attal's declaration on August 27 that ""the abaya can no longer be worn to school,"" which echoes Nicolas Sarkozy, who fourteen years ago, on June 22, 2009, said: “The burqa is not welcome on the French Republic's territory."" It led to the law passed on October 11, 2010, that prohibited concealing the face in the public space. In both statements, it's not the women who are the subject of the sentence, but the clothing they wear, such as the abaya or burqa – exogenous objects that threaten the nation’s integrity.Such a caricatured portrayal might give rise to a smile if it weren't so popular with a large proportion of the French population and exploited by political figures, which as they do so, reveals their obsession, since the days of colonialism, with Muslim women's bodies. In the end, there is little mention of the women themselves. They are still the great unknowns in the speculation about them. Yet to suspect these girls of maneuvering against the school is to overestimate an adolescent minority phenomenon that remains harmless.There's no denying that the abaya is a religious garment, even if those concerned refute it. By ingenuously asserting that the abaya is not a religious garment, but a traditional item of clothing worn by choice as a fashionable statement, the teenagers concerned play on its polymorphism. While the elegant dresses worn in Gulf countries in particular may indeed be called ""abayas,"" the term has a completely different meaning in France. With its pared-down design – no form-hugging cut – its unembroidered plain colors, and frequently elasticated cuffs, the abaya fits the image of a pious Muslim woman.The women I have met in the course of my sociological research wear the abaya with a long veil, identifiable as Islamic in the way it is attached to the head, leaving no doubt as to the expression of their faith. This is also the case with schoolgirls wearing the abaya, who cover their hair as soon as they leave school. There is no question that the garment expresses religiosity, as it is purchased in specialized stores and websites aimed at a practicing Muslim clientele, rather than in mainstream ready-to-wear stores. Although when taken out of context it is perceived as a simple dress, the abaya is worn in France for its Islamic significance. Those who wear it to school should therefore logically fall under the ban imposed by the 2004 law.",/en/religions/

Spoken in Italian, this comment concluded a question-and-answer session and a speech in which Francis invited his listeners to ""be artisans of peace"" and ""seeds of reconciliation.""Unsurprisingly, the choice of referring to ""great mother Russia"" and the imperial past provoked enthusiasm in Russia and exasperation in Ukraine. The Vatican press room then attempted to defuse the controversy: The pope's words were to be seen as a simple encouragement ""to preserve and promote what is positive in Russia's great cultural and spiritual heritage, and certainly not to exalt imperialistic logics and governmental personalities, cited to indicate certain historical periods of reference.""These words, however, have raised questions regarding the Vatican's position on the war. The Vatican's efforts to maintain symbolic and diplomatic ties with Russia have regularly met with incomprehension. The Holy See's communiqué from August 30, 2022, naming Russia as the initiator of a conflict that is ""morally unjust, unacceptable, barbaric, senseless, repugnant and sacrilegious,"" has not dispelled accusations of duplicity.How can we understand the meaning of this speech: a blunder or diplomatic strategy? Rereading the past of this country marked by Orthodoxy, Francis focused on its political history, citing Peter the Great (tsar from 1682-1725) and Catherine II (1762-1796). It's easy to see why Ukrainians were so upset. Peter and Catherine were tsars of imperial conquest, and Catherine pursued an intense colonization policy in Crimea.No doubt the pope had other perspectives in mind when he evoked these two sovereigns, such as their European stature with the founding of St. Petersburg, a gateway to the Baltic, and Catherine's association with the philosophers of the Enlightenment. These two reigns also saw the development of the local Catholic Church. The oukase (decree) of 1705 guaranteed freedom of worship to Catholic foreigners. And it was under Catherine II that several churches were opened (including St. Catherine's, where the videoconference was held) and diocesan structures were established.",/en/religions/
Macron to attend Pope Francis's mass in Marseille,    The French president's attendance at the Catholic mass celebrated by the pope in Marseille next week has proved a controversial issue in this secular country. ,"French President Emmanuel Macron will attend a Catholic mass celebrated by Pope Francis in Marseille next week, the Elysée presidential office said on Thursday, September 14.The question of Macron's attendance at the September 23 service in the Mediterranean city's Velodrome stadium has been controversial in strictly secular France, where the government has in recent weeks been pushing to bar in schools the abaya garment worn by some Muslim women.The mass will be a ""popular event"" and ""festive"", said a presidential official, asking not to be named. The separation between church and state in France ""absolutely does not exclude the Republic from maintaining relations with all religions"", said the official.But hard-left former presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon wrote on X, formerly Twitter, ahead of the Elysée's announcement: ""The Pope is welcome in France... Macron is gatecrashing. Booing at the mass will be for (Macron), not the Pope,"" he added.Francis is set to arrive in Marseille on September 22, planning to give a speech outside the city's landmark Notre Dame de la Garde church in which he will hail migrants lost at sea trying to reach Europe.As well as holding mass for thousands of people in the stadium the following day, he will close a week-long gathering of bishops discussing migration, poverty and climate change, and meet deprived Marseille residents.Macron will meet the pope privately before Francis celebrates mass. The presidential official indicated Macron would not take communion during the mass.",/en/religions/
Gérard Miller: 'Never have so many French Jews lost their moral compass to such an extent',"The film director and psychoanalyst believes that two Jewish identities are now in opposition, as some Jews have allowed themselves to be seduced by the far right.","I belong to a generation of Jews, born after the war, for whom being on the political left was a matter of course, from adolescence onward.I belong to a generation that viscerally hated anything remotely related to the far right, and to whom Israel represented first and foremost the refuge that our parents and grandparents, victims of Nazism, had lacked, even though we made no secret of our sympathy for the Palestinians.I belong to a generation where being Jewish and French naturally meant loving Maximilien Robespierre and the 1789 revolution, Louise Michel and the Paris Commune, Emile Zola, Léon Blum, Missak Manouchian and Jean-Paul Sartre.I belong to a generation in which Jews, because of the suffering they had endured over the centuries, seemed to us more than ever to provide the face of tolerance, solidarity and culture, too.Of course, in those distant days, not all French Jews shared the same reference points and values. But, regardless of their convictions and beliefs, they all had at least three inviolable memories in common: the sham of the Alfred Dreyfus affair (in which a Jewish military captain was convicted of treason), the crimes of the collaborationist Philippe Pétain regime and the horror of the Holocaust. That was a lot and it meant it was possible to debate everything else together, with strong opposition but without tearing each other apart, even within the very conservative Representative Council of Jewish Institutions (CRIF).Today, alas, all that belongs to the past, and the French Jewish community is completely fractured. Marine Le Pen's incredible sleight of hand has made thousands of Jews forget the neo-fascist ideology of her far-right movement, which was founded by people nostalgic for Nazism and collaboration. And Eric Zemmour has completed her work, definitively pulverizing everything that had hitherto maintained a little coherence and cohesion in the French Jewish community.Much has been made of Zemmour's comments on Pétain, ""savior of the Jews,"" but those on Dreyfus have attracted less attention. That wasn't the only time Zemmour publicly pandered to anti-Semites: He defended Maurice Papon, convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity; proposed abolishing the Gayssot law, which punishes the crime of Holocaust denial; and cast aspersions on the Jewish children murdered by French jihadist Mohammed Merah because their family had buried them in Israel.But by casting doubt on Dreyfus's innocence, Zemmour came full circle, knowingly using the deniers' favorite figure of speech, understatement, the art of expressing the most by saying the least. A denier enjoys humbly presenting himself as an ignoramus: He's not a historian, he hasn't studied the subject and he doesn't have all the facts at hand to determine the existence of the gas chambers. With exactly the same cynicism, Zemmour explained that the Dreyfus affair is a ""troubled history,"" that ""nothing is obvious"" and that ""we'll never know the truth."" In so doing, what he was ensuring was the silence of Jews converted to right-wing extremism and verifying that no alarm bells were ringing in their heads.",/en/religions/
Macron defends choice to attend Pope's mass in Marseille,    Left-wing politicians especially have attacked Macron's choice to attend the religious service when the government is cracking down on school pupils wearing the abaya in the name of secularism. ,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, September 15, defended his plan to attend a huge mass to be celebrated by Pope Francis in the southern city of Marseille next week, after critics said he was failing to live up to France's secular values.""I think it's my place to be there. I won't be there as a Catholic, I'll be there as president of the republic, which is indeed secular,"" Macron said during a trip to Semur-en-Auxois in central France. ""I will not myself carry out any religious practice during the mass,"" he added.Left-wing politicians especially have attacked Macron's choice to attend the religious service during the Pope's two-day visit, which comes as the government is cracking down on school pupils wearing the abaya, a garment popular with some Muslim women, in the name of secularism.""I respect faith and people with faith. But I disagree with an elected official, and especially the president, taking part in a religious ceremony in his official capacity,"" La France Insoumise (LFI, hard left) lawmaker Alexis Corbiere wrote on social media.Macron said that ""the state is neutral. Public services are neutral, we will protect schools as well as we have reiterated"" as pupils return for the new academic year.Francis's mass at Velodrome stadium in Marseille is expected to draw tens of thousands of people, marking the high point of a two-day visit on September 22-23.Macron also announced Friday a public fundraiser offering tax breaks to individuals chipping in to restore church buildings in French villages. The scheme would aim to ""mobilize 200 million euros over four years"", he said, arguing that many small towns found the cost of renovations ""unsustainable"". Up to 3,000 small-town churches are believed to be in danger, according to France's Observatory of Religious Heritage.

Macron pampers French Catholics ahead of Pope visit to Marseille,    The French president announced the launch of a fund-raising campaign to renovate thousands of endangered religious buildings across the country and defended his intention to attend Pope Francis' mass in Marseille on September 23. ,"Between a trip to India on September 9-10 to attend the G20 summit and a visit to France by Charles III of the United Kingdom on September 20-22 ahead of a visit of Pope Francis on September 22-23, the trip was meant to be a quiet moment of ""proximity"" for the French president, a juncture of harmony with the so-called France of steeples, the one that worries at sight of its village churches falling into decay. Visiting Semur-en-Auxois and Bussy-Rabutin, Burgundy, on Friday, September 15, Emmanuel Macron appealed to the nation's generosity by launching a fundraising campaign to restore religious buildings needing repair.But the anouncement did not come without its share of controversy. When Macron reached Semur-en-Auxois at around midday, the streets were sparsely populated as a result of drastic traffic restrictions. Alain Houpert, a French local senator affiliated with the conservative party Les Républicains, said on X (formerly Twitter) that he would ignore the visit, which, he said, no longer carried any ""republican"" features. A few dozen citizens had been safely tucked away from the journalists in a corner of Semur-en-Auxois' church square that Macron had come to visit. He received a few cheers, and an isolated hoot, before greeting the crowd and entering the church with his wife Brigitte, French television host Stéphane Bern, who's been appointed to safegard France's endangered heritage, and local representatives.The coincidence of this presidential outing with the Pope's forthcoming visit could be interpreted as an attempt by Macron to send a message to Catholics. When leaving the church, he felt the need to explain his decision to attend the mass to be celebrated by the pontiff in Marseille on September 23. ""It's my responsibility to go,"" he said, adding he would not be going ""as a Catholic"" but as the ""president of the French Republic, which is indeed secular."" He said he would not be ""practicing religion"" during the mass.""No, Mr. President, it's not your responsibility to go to the Pope's mass,"" said Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the radical-left party La France Insoumise. ""To welcome him on arrival and even on departure: yes, of course. But the secular state neither recognizes nor subsidizes any religion.""As for Friday's religious heritage trip, the presidency denied it was related to Pope Francis' arrival. ""It's a commitment made on June 5,"" said an adviser at the Elysée. ""It's linked to the European Heritage Days [September 16-17] and in no way to the Pope's visit."" On June 5, on the sidelines of a visit to the Catholic site Mont-Saint-Michel, western France, Macron had outlined a national campaign supporting religious heritage.",/en/religions/
"'By coming to Marseille, Pope Francis is continuing the Catholic habit of creating mobilizing utopias'","The head of the Catholic Church is coming to Marseille to expound his fantasized vision of a Mediterranean region united under one great monotheistic matrix, writes Blandine Chelini-Pont, professor of history at the University of Aix-Marseille.","Pope Francis is coming ""to Marseille,"" not ""to France."" His somewhat abrupt response to the journalist who questioned him at a press conference on August 6 was not a communication blunder. Of course, it is only natural that our local and national authorities have decided to make the most of the event, if only because of the huge organizational and security effort it requires. But Francis has his own agenda. And in a way, he is not coming to see the Marseille people either. No, Francis is coming to talk about the plight of migrants in the Mediterranean. He is coming to Marseilles as Vincent de Paul once did, the saintly man filled with compassion for the arsenal galley slaves. Francis has come to shake people's consciences, at a time when the countries the migrants are trying to reach are feeling their recurring flows as a growing threat.Francis is also arriving with a broader project, a vision of the Mediterranean. In this, he is continuing the Catholic trend of creating mobilizing utopias, representations that are both political and spiritual, exercises in imagination and interpretation, together capable of displaying realities that do not yet exist but are destined to happen. One of these realities, European unity, inspired the whole of the 20th century. And the European utopia took shape, accompanied by a whole lineage of idealists bent on erasing bellicose nationalism and predatory totalitarianism in the communitarian objective.Francis' Mediterranean utopia is not only for Catholics, but is de facto for all other believers in the Mediterranean, especially Muslims. It endows the ex-Mare Nostrum with a special vocation: ""The Mediterranean,"" Francis asserted in Bari, February 2020, ""is the sea of crossbreeding, forever culturally open to encounter, dialogue and reciprocal inculturation."" As with Europe, Francis's Mediterranean dream embraces the idea of a common civilization. But while a united Europe drew its pontifical justifications from the fertile matrix of a single great Roman-Christian civilization, Pope Francis' Mediterranean is justified by the existence of a great monotheistic matrix, beyond its Christian imprints.His vision of the divine breath is multilateral, rendering obsolete any Latin affirmation of unity forged by a few centuries of Roman-Byzantine empires and religious monopoly. Francis is taking the Mediterranean on a kind of great leap forward, where the practice and effectiveness of encounter, the cross-fertilization and peaceful intermingling of Revelations would characterize its authentic civilization. Historians will judge this to be a generous feat.",/en/religions/
The French Catholic far right is no longer holding back against Pope Francis,"    Ahead of the pope's visit to Marseille in southern France on September 22 and 23, Eric Zemmour and his supporters have launched a political offensive against the pontiff for his humanist approach to migrants. ","Francis is not their pope anymore, and they are not afraid to say so out loud. Just a few days before the pope's visit to Marseille on September 22 and 23 – and as a new influx of migrants disembarked on the Italian island of Lampedusa has rekindled European debates on the migratory crisis – a section of the French far right, which has certainly never been fond of the Argentinian pope, is adopting a stance that deviates from the conventional Catholic stance on pontiffs.Leaders of Eric Zemmour's Reconquête! party are not upset about the French president's planned attendance at the pontifical mass. In their eyes, this is not a matter for controversy, nor is it according to the right-wing Les Républicains (LR). Fifty-seven LR senators introduced a bill on Monday to ""enshrine France's Judeo-Christian roots"" in Article 1 of the Constitution. This initiative, which came just a few days before the pope's visit, was prompted by LR senator Stéphane Le Rudulier, whose constituency includes Marseille, and who is a spokesperson for Bruno Retailleau, head of the LR senators. The latter spoke on Tuesday morning on radio France Inter of a ""flood of migrants"" in Lampedusa.The presence of Pope Francis and his planned speech on migrants is what is bothering the most radical fringe of the far right. Zemmour and his allies Marion Maréchal and Stéphane Ravier have even invoked the Bible or Christian authors in their criticisms. ""I disagree with Pope Francis,"" declared Maréchal, the granddaughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen who will lead Reconquête in the European elections, on BFM-TV on September 14. She questioned the pontiff's emphasis on charity. ""I think [he] has no business in politics, and he's too involved in it,"" said Maréchal, who professes her Catholic faith. ""The pope is only infallible on dogma, and in this case, he's looking through the lens of a South American who doesn't know the type of immigration we're experiencing and obviously doesn't fully understand what we're facing.""""From Christianity, I learned a very beautiful idea of Saint Augustine's – you can't do good to the point of evil,"" echoed Zemmour on BFM-TV on Sunday, in a statement which, according to several exegetes, invented a quotation from the Roman philosopher and theologian. Jean-Marie Salamito, a specialist in the history of Christianity in the ancient world, said that he had been unable to find ""either in French or in Latin"" the idea – or anything similar – ""incorrectly attributed"" to Saint Augustine. ""The idea that one can do good and end up with evil seems neither Augustinian nor Christian to me,"" this associate member of the Institute of Augustinian Studies told the newspaper La Croix.",/en/religions/
Pavard scores two headers to secure France's victory over Scotland,    The French defender became the unlikely hero in the French football team's 4-1 triumph over Scotland in a friendly in Lille on Tuesday. ,"Defender Benjamin Pavard scored twice and Kylian Mbappé struck from the spot as France came from behind to beat Scotland 4-1 in a friendly in Lille on Tuesday, October 17.Kick-off was delayed by 10 minutes due to increased security measures after two Swedes were shot dead in an attack in Brussels on Monday before a Euro 2024 qualifier between Belgium and Sweden that was later abandoned.Billy Gilmour gave Scotland a surprise lead in the 11th minute, sweeping sweetly into the far corner after an inexplicable mistake by Eduardo Camavinga.But France, who qualified for Euro 2024 last week like Scotland, hit back five minutes later as Pavard glanced home Antoine Griezmann's corner at the near post.Pavard then became the first France player to score two headed goals in the same game since Zinedine Zidane in the 1998 World Cup final, diving to nod in a cross from Mbappé after excellent work by the France captain. ""I felt like I could score tonight,"" said Pavard, who left Bayern Munich for Inter Milan in August. ""Someone told me 'You're going to score' and I got two, so even better.""Mbappé, whose brace in Friday's 2-1 win in the Netherlands secured qualification, netted a third for the hosts with a penalty after Liam Cooper was punished for grabbing a fistful of Olivier Giroud's shirt.Kingsley Coman slammed in a fourth with 20 minutes to play after Griezmann stabbed against the crossbar from point-blank range.France round out their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign with games against Gibraltar and Greece next month. Didier Deschamps' side have six wins from six in Group B and are guaranteed to finish top.Scotland, who dropped their first points in Group A after losing 2-0 to Spain last Thursday, are away to Georgia before finishing up at home to Norway.""We have a good team in there. I know the results don't show it but we'll take the positives into our last two group games,"" Gilmour told BBC Radio Scotland.

'The Boy and the Heron' producer Toshio Suzuki: 'Miyazaki doesn't have a lot of self-confidence',    The co-founder of Studio Ghibli talks to Le Monde about his collaboration with the Japanese master of animation. ,"In 1985, producer Toshio Suzuki co-founded Studio Ghibli with directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies), whom he worked with for many years. The author of Mixing Work with Pleasure: My Time at Studio Ghibli, who now heads this mecca of Japanese animation, produced The Boy and the Heron, which is in theaters in France from Wednesday, November 1.The Japanese title is Kimitachi wa Do ikiru ka, which is often translated as ""how do you live?"" But, to better reflect its meaning, it should be translated as ""what kind of person do you want to be?"" or ""how will you choose to live your life?"" Many Japanese people carry this philosophical question within them and wonder about the meaning of their lives. The film was intriguing for them.I think foreigners share the same questions. Westerners live in a world dominated by capitalism, which they see as a religion. They have lost the meaning of many things and are questioning themselves. As a result, many people are asking themselves the fundamental question of the meaning of life. The film is by no means a lesson from Miyazaki. He doesn't tell people how to live. He says: ""This is my life. But what about you? How do you choose to live?"" His message is more like an invitation to question.There are too many messages broadcast on a daily basis. In Japan, there are a lot of blockbusters whose distributors bombard us with commercials. Promotion is excessive. It doesn't work with consumers anymore. Based on this observation, we came up with the idea of doing no advertising, capitalizing on Hayao Miyazaki's world-famous status. I wanted to see what would happen. In the end, the absence of promotion generated extra attention. There was a large audience and very positive reactions right from the start. I would add that the choice not to advertise is, in a way, linked to the story of the film.If you want to make a film properly and without compromise, you need time. In the beginning, I didn't give Miyazaki any deadline. Paradoxically, this caused him a lot of stress. One day, he asked me: ""When do you want me to finish?"" In the final months, I finally set him a date, but he also thanked me by saying that not setting a deadline from the start had been a good decision.",/en/culture/

'Now and Then': An artificial resurrection of a Beatles song,"    Paul McCartney on Thursday unveiled a 'new' Beatles song featuring John Lennon, crafted through a blend of past recordings and cutting-edge technology. ","By autumn 1963, The Beatles had already stolen hearts in the United Kingdom with their fourth single, ""She Loves You,"" soon to be followed by ""I Want to Hold Your Hand."" They lent a helping hand to their friends The Rolling Stones, who were also trying to break through, by covering their song ""I Wanna Be Your Man."" Fast forward 60 years later, and the two biggest British Invasion bands are back in the headlines. On October 20, the Stones released Hackney Diamonds, their 24th studio album, which features 81-year-old Paul McCartney on the bass. McCartney, meanwhile, released ""Now and Then"" on November 2 with the other surviving member of the Fab Four, drummer Ringo Starr. It was announced with Sgt. Pepper-level fanfare as ""probably the last Beatles song.""This is false since the Liverpool Four split up in 1970. Furthermore, ""the last Beatles song,"" or at least the one featuring John Lennon, George Harrison, McCartney and Starr together in the studio for the last time was ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)."" The long, obsessive blues track mixed on August 20, 1969, was included on the album Abbey Road. McCartney and Starr's anachronistic forgeries, aided and abetted by Lennon's widow Yoko Ono, have done nothing to change this fact.""Now and Then"" is in fact the third attempt to represent a Lennon solo composition, post-break-up, as a Beatles creation. So it is no more a Beatles song than ""Imagine"" or ""Woman."" McCartney may well claim that this initiative would have met Lennon's approval, but there is no evidence to suggest that the reclusive New Yorker had any intention of entering into any joint project prior to his assassination on December 8, 1980. In an interview with Playboy magazine shortly before his death, he said ""no way"" to this hypothesis, saying it was not ""serious.""In an interview with the BBC in 2021, McCartney blamed his former bandmate for the break-up. That may well be the case, but why not respect his wishes? Originally, ""Now and Then"" was one of four unfinished Lennon songs that Yoko Ono entrusted to McCartney in 1994 to finalize by adding instruments. Two of those songs, ""Free as Bird"" and ""Real Love,"" went on to be featured on the first two volumes of the Anthology series in 1995 and 1996. They had help in the production from George Harrison – who had declared that ""the Beatles would not get back together as long as John Lennon was dead"" – and his friend Jeff Lynne (Electric Light Orchestra). Recorded by Lennon on piano in 1977, ""Now and Then"" was quickly discarded at Harrison's request due to its poor audio quality. The guitarist, who died in 2001, is no longer around to veto it. The technological flaw was overcome by isolating and cleaning the voice using artificial intelligence, an operation carried out by New Zealand director Peter Jackson, who used the same process in his documentary series The Beatles: Get Back (2021).",/en/culture/
Chéri Samba in powerful words and images at the Musée Maillol,"    The 50 or so paintings on show, belonging to the collector Jean Pigozzi, confirm the singularity of this Congolese painter. ","Today, Chéri Samba is a celebrated artist. He has taken part in many major collective shows: at Paris's Centre Pompidou, with ""Magiciens de la Terre"" (Earth Magicians) in 1989 and ""Africa Remix"" in 2005; at the Venice Biennale in 2007; at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in 2017. But his personal retrospectives are rare: The last in Paris, which was only his second, was held in 2004 at the Fondation Cartier. Yet it would be an understatement to say that the painter, born in 1956 in Kinto M'Vuila, Democratic Republic of Congo, occupies a remarkable place in today's art. The presentation of some 50 paintings at the Musée Maillol in Paris is a testament to his singularity and coherence. They belong to the French-Italian collector Jean Pigozzi, who has long been Samba's main fan.Having moved to Kinshasa in 1972, he laid down the principles of his painting right from the start and has remained firmly attached to them ever since, the only perceptible developments being the progressive enlargement of formats and the extreme perfection of execution, up to and including virtuoso pieces. His first principle is to deal with all the subjects of everyday life, in the Congo and around the world, especially those that cause pain or fear. Gender inequality, racism, the memory of slavery and colonialism, poverty, the problems of water and pollution, epidemics that spread against a backdrop of ignorance, child soldiers, American imperialism, terrorism and corruption: It's hard to imagine what feature of contemporary humanity Samba could have omitted from his inventory.They alternate between mocking satires of morals and merciless allegories of current affairs. Adultery and sexual desire are at the forefront of the former. The latter are divided between those dealing with international politics and war, on the one hand, and, on the other, those that expose the disdain with which Western cultural institutions treated the ancient arts of Africa and contemporary African artists until the end of the 20th century. His work is therefore central to the debate on appropriation, spoliation and restitution.Setting himself such subjects, Samba knew at once that words would be as necessary to him as figures and colors. Starting with comic strips and signs, he transferred their processes to canvas: dialogues between characters, book pages, captions and comments in capital letters along the edges of the canvas. In English, French or Lingala, they render accessible what images cannot fully express. Samba does without them only when he deems that the pictures are explicit enough on their own and their symbolism easily accessible. Such is the case with his self-portrait in the form of a spiral garland, a paintbrush between his teeth, the title of which reads ""J'aime la couleur"" (""I Love Color"").",/en/culture/
"'Spamalot', the Monty Python-style musical comedy comes to Paris","    At the Théâtre de Paris, Pierre-François Martin-Laval is presenting a new adaptation of the show based on the film 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail.' ","The sound of hooves announces the arrival of King Arthur and his faithful squire, Patsy. But there is no horse for Arthur, who imitates the animal's gait while Patsy strikes a pair of coconuts together to mimic the noise. Later, Arthur and his knights of the Round Table must endure a barrage of insults from Frenchmen guarding a castle, and the Black Knight who, despite losing his arms and his legs in a duel, continues to want to fight,These are just some of the moments from the zany 1975 film, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, led by the predominantly British Monty Python comedy troupe of Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones along with American Terry Gilliam. The feature film has since been turned into a musical, Spamalot, created in 2005. The cult sequences mentioned above are featured in the French adaptation, presented at the Théâtre de Paris from Saturday, September 23, and set to run until the end of the year, then again from mid-January to the end of April 2024.In 2010, actor, director and producer Pierre-François Martin-Laval, aka Pef, best known for being one of the members of another comedy troupe, Les Robins des Bois (the Robinhoods), made a French adaptation of Spamalot. Ten years later, he is offering a revised and updated version, where beggars are encouraged to cross the village street to find work, and where you have to be on TikTok to have influence.The original musical retains the compositions of John Du Prez and Eric Idle, the latter having written the libretto and song lyrics. For the French version, musicians are installed in the alcoves of the balconies near the Théâtre de Paris stage. Keyboards, winds, bass and drums are played live, in a rather music-hall and cabaret approach, with a few nods to gospel, opera parody and even military anthems. Pef, who plays Arthur, interprets the rhythm, absurd situations, innuendo and crude formulas of Idle's story and songs.On stage, some 20 actors and actresses sing (also live), dance and sometimes take on several different roles. The troupe will make you smile, laugh, sometimes burst out, and is attentive to a collective work carried out with precision in its exchanges and gestures. This is evident in the show-stopping sequences: the arrival of the Lady of the Lake, played by Lauren Van Kempen, who moves with ease through a wide range of musical styles; the encouragements given to Arthur in the manner of American competitive cheerleading; the revue-style ballet of knights raising their legs. And, during the dialogue sequences, Arthur, Lancelot and Galahad have numerous encounters with various characters, including the mysterious knights who say ""Ni!"" or the enchanter perched on a swing.",/en/culture/
50 Cent ruins his tour's final French stop,"    On Friday, the American star performed in Paris, celebrating the 20th anniversary of his first studio album, 'Get Rich or Die Tryin.' ","Hip-hop veterans such as Ice-T and Snoop Dogg have, for weeks now, proudly crowed on social media about the fact that concerts by rappers from the 1990s have been selling out, while the younger generation has struggled to fill venues. 50 Cent's ""The Final Lap Tour,"" which ended in France on Friday, November 3, at the Paris La Défense Arena, didn't completely prove them wrong. After sold-out concerts in Nantes and Strasbourg, the gangsta rapper from Queens, who was celebrating the 20th anniversary of his debut studio album Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003), drew 31,000 people to the 40,000-capacity Paris venue.However, unlike his fellow New Yorkers Nas and Wu-Tang Clan, who played the Accor Arena in Paris on June 7 with unprecedented professionalism, 50 Cent (real name Curtis Jackson) failed to live up to the expectations set by his career and his self-proclaimed qualities as a businessman. He arrived more than an hour and a half late, and botched his sound check, forcing Paris La Défense Arena to postpone opening their doors, as queues outside grew longer.Once inside, the other stars on the bill, R&B singer Jeremih and the veteran Busta Rhymes, did their best to warm the crowd back up. Arriving on stage at 10 pm, an almost inaudible 50 Cent struggled to get his concert off the ground, even with pyrotechnic effects, a laser show and a score of thong-clad dancers. Like in his music video for ""In Da Club,"" he seemed to have emerged from a laboratory and was presented to the public as a new man, all muscles. The concert opened with ""What Up Gangsta,"" like his first album, which was produced by Dr. Dre and Eminem and sold over 15 million copies worldwide.A host of celebrities, from the actor Guillaume Canet to the DJ Cut Killer, were in the VIP area to watch the American's concert. His film-worthy life story – boxer, crack dealer at the age of 12, once shot in the jaw – has made him one of the biggest stars of this musical genre in the United States, thanks in part to his distinctive flow.On stage, 50 Cent made the most of his reputation and muscularity, but struggled to break out of his ""rapper stance"", marking the beat with an outstretched arm. Despite the hits – ""Hate It or Love It,"" ""How We Do"" (a track recorded with Dr. Dre's other protégé, The Game, with whom he eventually fell out), ""Candy Shop"" and ""Window Shopper"" – the dancers' choreographies, each one sexier and more acrobatic than the last, and the two hype men who accompanied him, 50 Cent remained ineffective. He communicated little with the audience, except to ask for an ovation for his friend Eminem, referring to him by his nickname Slim Shady.",/en/culture/
Chéri Samba: 'I know how my painting will end',"    In an interview with Le Monde, the Congolese artist talks about his career and creative process, on the occasion of a retrospective on his work, at the Musée Maillol in Paris. ","On the occasion of a major exhibition of his work, from 1981 to the present day, at the Musée Maillol in Paris, the Congolese artist looks back at his personal journey, his conception of art, his creative methods and the messages he transmits through images and words.Today, I think we're accepted. Back then, we were not known. By dint of speaking out and complaining, the world has listened to us. Now, all doors are open. The process began when we were able to talk about our work, with the help of those who understood that there were artists in Africa who were being ignored. There was Jean-François Bizot, whom I'd like to mention first. In 1982, he invited me to come to Paris and published me in Actuel. Then André Magnin, who allowed me to take part in the ""Magiciens de la Terre"" (Earth Magicians) exhibition in Paris in 1989, and Jean Pigozzi, who saw my paintings there for the first time. These three really worked to pull us out of the darkness we were in.Not only that. I started exhibiting in supposedly appropriate venues: at the Centre Wallonie Bruxelles, the banquet hall at the French Embassy, the French Cultural Center in Lubumbashi. That's how it was, even if I didn't agree, because I thought exhibitions should be held in front of the people, the masses, and not in galleries, where the initiated go. When I displayed my paintings, it was in the street. I'd put the paintings out on the sidewalk in front of the studio, and there would always be people there to look and react. I'd go out and chat with them: This sharing gave me the courage to go on.""Popular"" is a word to be wary of, because it can be misunderstood. When I used it back then, it was in a well-defined sense: Presenting people with things they could relate to, rather than codifying their understanding. In art, there were all these artists I didn't understand myself, whose work I had to explain: What it meant, why, how etc. In popular art, in my sense of the word, everyone sees what it's all about. Popular doesn't mean easy, unreflected, or haphazard. I've never worked that way, but always in a considered way.",/en/culture/
"Miyazaki in Le Monde, the long road to celebration","    The master of Japanese animation's 12th feature film, 'The Boy and the Heron,' is in French cinemas on November 1. His name didn't appear in the newspaper until June 1993, even though the filmmaker had already produced such masterpieces as 'Castle in the Sky,' 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke.' ","With The Boy and the Heron, the 12th feature film by Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki, being released in France on November 1 44 years after his first opus, The Castle of Cagliostro, hit Japanese screens, it is striking that Le Monde waited until June 3, 1993, to mention the filmmaker.The French daily's special correspondent to the Annecy International Animation Film Festival, Jean-Michel Frodon, mentioned the spotlight on a Japanese director, ""celebrated in his country and little-known here, whose three feature-length films are being presented to the curiosity of the 4,000 professionals and large audiences expected in attendance."" Miyazaki had already produced masterworks such as The Castle in the Sky (1986) and My Neighbor Totoro (1988), which had yet to be shown. Porco Rosso (1992), presented at the competition, went on to receive the feature film award.Is this to say that Le Monde was late to the party? By no means. While not early, it was a little less late than others. None of Miyazaki's films had yet been released in France. As they were not available in cinemas, they were the stuff of secret and rumor. Above all, Asian cinema was just beginning to make inroads in the West. In the years that followed, filmmakers from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea came to dominate the film landscape, along with those from Japan.When Porco Rosso was finally released in France in 1995, Le Monde gave it a rather lukewarm reception. In its June 23 edition, Frodon remained ambivalent: ""Emerging from a cloud of praise, Porco Rosso, the Japanese-animated aviator pig, lands on French screens. His first contact is rather disappointing: The characters' graphics remain close to the flat silliness of Japanese cartoons, and the script, which pits the porcine hero in his scarlet monoplane against a band of foul-mouthed villains, seems to manipulate the same old recipes.""In support of the review, the evening daily featured an article by Brice Pedroletti, the paper's Tokyo-based correspondent, detailing the growth of Japanese animation: 2,000 titles a year on television, some 30 in cinema and one powerhouse, Miyazaki who, in the space of 15 years or so, ""has acquired cult status for a writer-director and is racking up the hits"" and become a phenomenon.His feature-length Porco Rosso topped the Japanese box office in 1992. The correspondent reported that, in addition to his work, Miyazaki, together with Isao Takahata, another director, headed up Studio Ghibli, a name that was then unknown in the West but nowadays is much more familiar.",/en/culture/
'The colonial issue is the last taboo of France's 19th and 20th century history',"Nicolas Bancel and Pascal Blanchard, two historians, advocate for creating a 'museum of colonization,' like in other European countries, which would put antagonistic memories into perspective and help millions of people see themselves reflected in history.","The history of colonization is now a subject of public debate. These debates are highly polarized: Between the advocates of a nostalgic vision of the past – apostles of decline who are increasingly vocal, as shown by the 11th wave of the ""Fractures françaises"" poll– and the most radical decolonialists, who maintain that our contemporary world is entirely the product of the colonial period. Yet, no one today really casts any doubt on the importance of this five-century-long part of French history.Far removed from the extremists' memorial conflicts, public opinion seems divided between acknowledging this past or maintaining a policy of amnesia, of which the debates surrounding the 2005 law on the ""positive aspects of colonization"" were the latest peak. Twenty years on, public policies on the subject are marked by the absence of any collective treatment of this past. The impossibility of establishing a ""colonial museum"" in France is a symptom of this, even as the Cité Internationale de la Langue Française (""International City of the French Language"") has just opened in Villers-Cotterêts.Although colonial history may not be at the root of our present in its totality, its contemporary repercussions are obvious. Indeed, recent events in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso are, according to Achille Mbembe, the signs of a ""second decolonization,"" and are marked by anti-French protests that demonstrate a desire to move on from asymmetric relations with their former ""mainland"". In truth, despite French authorities' repeated assurances of their willingness to put an end to ""Françafrique"" [a term critical of France's relationships with its former African colonies], deeds have hardly followed words, and the colonial chapter has not really been closed.France also suffers from a toxic relationship with its post-colonial immigration and working-class neighborhoods, which have become central political issues. Yet how can we understand the historical patterns of these migratory flows without looking back at the history of colonization?  How can we understand the stigmatization that these populations suffer without deconstructing the representations they were subjected to during colonization?We could cite numerous examples – such as the desire to remove statues symbolizing the colonial past, to change certain street names, the debates about the contents of school textbooks, etc. – and recall that the issue of our colonial past resurfaces at every presidential election. It is clearly the last taboo in France's 19th- and 20th-century history.",/en/culture/
Strike at Centre Pompidou reveals deep-seated anxiety among staff,"    Personnel are worried about what will happen to them during the museum's closure, scheduled for 2025 to 2030. They fear the use of outsourced providers and are calling to be redeployed at a single location. ","On Sunday, November 5, the doors of the Centre Pompidou in Paris were closed for the fifth time since the start of a strike that began on October 16. They were closed again on November 6, after a general meeting of staff at which the latest version of the memorandum of understanding negotiated between the unions and management was presented – the strike notice having been extended by a month. ""The situation is bogged down, and we haven't yet found a way out,"" said the general secretary of the CFDT-Culture union, Alexis Fritche.For weeks, staff have been demanding written guarantees of their future during the site's five-year closure between 2025 and 2030 for major works, including asbestos removal. The future is clear for the employees at the Bibliothèque Publique d'Information (Public Information Library), who have found a new home in the Lumière building in the 12th arrondissement on Avenue des Terroirs-de-France, near Bercy Village, as well as for employees at the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique-Musique (Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music, IRCAM), who are not affected by the closure.The situation is distinctly vague for the rest of the staff, who will be reassigned between the existing storage facilities in northern Paris; the new branch in Massy (Essonne), scheduled to open in summer 2026; and the Grand Palais, where, in 2025, the Centre Pompidou will be able to hold exhibitions in a space of some 2,800 square meters. ""What we're proposing is exceptional and unique,"" said the center's president, Laurent Le Bon, during an audio press conference on October 24, and cited as a counterexample the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, ""which will be closed for 14 years with no backup solutions.""Le Bon's complacent statement has done nothing to appease the unions. ""With less than a year to go before the move begins in autumn 2024, people don't know where they're going, or under what conditions,"" said Philippe Mahé, secretary for Force Ouvrière (Worker's Force, one of France's five major labor federations) at the Centre Pompidou. ""Our demands have been clear from the outset: that our payroll, status and bonuses are maintained and a guarantee that we will return to our jobs when we reopen.""Staff in the carpentry workshops and the mediation department fear that their jobs will ultimately be lost to outsourced providers. The Centre Pompidou's management has promised that ""all staff who have permanent contracts and civil servants on the payroll at the time of the reopening will be reinstated in their jobs or in positions corresponding to their skills."" ""So why are they refusing to put into writing that there will be no outsourcing?"" said Rose-Marie Stolberg, representing the Union Nationale des Syndicats Autonomes (National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions, UNSA).",/en/culture/
The Louvre launches public funding campaign for Chardin's 'Le Panier de fraises des bois',"    The museum raised two-thirds of the sum needed to acquire the painting, thanks almost entirely to the LVMH group. It is now counting on a collective surge of generosity to acquire this 'national treasure.' ","The Louvre wanted it and soon it should be able to buy it. Le Panier de fraises des bois, by Jean Siméon Chardin (1699-1779), could soon be hanging on the walls of the Paris museum, which on Tuesday, November 7, launched a public subscription under the slogan ""Tous mécènes!"" (""All patrons!"") to secure the necessary funding.With already 41 works, the Louvre possesses the world's largest collection of still lifes by Chardin. But it lacks this icon from his late period, painted in 1761 when the artist was at the peak of his career, the only one in which this motif of bright red wild strawberries appears. ""It's the perfect painting of exceptional execution,"" enthused Laurence des Cars, director of the Louvre, recalling the fascination this painting held for artists of the 19th century. ""Manet saw this painting, and then the strawberry motif appeared in his work and then in Renoir's,"" she explained in detail.The work also caught the eye of the Goncourt brothers, who wrote in 1863: ""Therein lies the miracle of the things Chardin paints: Modeled in the mass and surround of their contours, drawn with their light, made as it were of the soul of their color, they seem to detach themselves from the canvas and come to life, by I know not what marvelous optical operation between the canvas and the spectator in space.""Since the 19th century, this still life painting has belonged to the descendants of Eudoxe Marcille (1814-1890), a great collector with a passion for French painting. For decades now, the Louvre has held ambitions to purchase it. When the still life appeared in March 2022 at the French auction house Artcurial, the Paris museum was taken by surprise. Le Panier de fraises des bois sold for €24.3 million to a bidder on behalf of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. The Louvre could not pre-empt the purchase. Its acquisition budget is capped at €13 million a year. The French Ministry of Culture suspended the sale and blocked its export by granting it the ""national treasure"" label. The State then had 30 months to raise the sum.Des Cars then turned to the LVMH group, whose name comes to mind as soon as works are valued in the tens of millions. When she was president of the Musée d'Orsay, des Cars had already approached the group to purchase another ""national treasure,"" La Partie de bateau (circa 1877-1878), by Gustave Caillebotte (1848-1894), worth a cool €43 million.In the case of the Chardin, des Cars only asked Bernard Arnault's group for two-thirds of the sum required, in other words, €15 million. Did the Louvre wish to defuse criticism of the ""national treasures"" law, which allows a company to benefit from a corporate tax reduction equal to 90% of its payments and high media coverage in relation to the sum actually disbursed?",/en/culture/
London climate protestors smash glass protecting Velazquez's Venus,"    Two activists from direct-action group Just Stop Oil broke the glass protecting 'The Rokeby Venus,' chosen because it was previously slashed in 1914 as part of the suffragette movement. ","Two climate change protesters were arrested on Monday, November 6, after they smashed a protective glass panel covering a famous Diego Velázquez oil painting at London's National Gallery, police said Monday. The two activists from the group Just Stop Oil targeted Velázquez's The Rokeby Venus – also known as The Toilet of Venus – with small hammers. Photos showed the protective glass panel punctured with several holes.Just Stop Oil, which has previously led similar protests targeting famous artworks and public buildings, said Monday's action was to demand Britain's government immediately halt all licensing for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK.The group said on Monday that the two activists chose to target Velázquez's 17th-century oil painting – one of the Spanish artist's most celebrated masterpieces – because it was previously slashed as part of the suffragette movement calling for women's rights in 1914. Just Stop Oil said the protesters hammered the glass panel, then told people at the gallery: ""Women did not get the vote by voting. It is time for deeds, not words."" ""Politics is failing us. It failed women in 1914 and it is failing us now,"" they added.Police said the two were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, adding that officers also arrested dozens of other Just Stop Oil protesters on Monday who were ""slow marching"" and obstructing traffic in central London's Whitehall as part of their civil disobedience strategy.The National Gallery said the painting has been removed from display so conservators can examine it. ""The pair appeared to strike 'The Toilet of Venus' ('The Rokeby Venus') by Velázquez with what appeared to be emergency rescue hammers. The room was cleared of visitors and police were called,"" the museum said in a statement. The room was reopened shortly afterward with another painting replacing the Velázquez where it was hung, the museum added.The Rokeby Venus depicts a naked Venus, the goddess of love, reclining on a bed with her back facing the viewer, as her son Cupid holds a mirror up to her face. The painting was targeted in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson to protest the imprisonment of fellow women's rights activist Emmeline Pankhurst. The painting suffered several slashes at the time but was subsequently repaired.Last year two activists threw two cans of tomato soup over Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers, also at the National Gallery, to protest fossil fuel extraction. They did not damage the painting, which was covered with glass.Part of a wave of youthful direct-action protest groups around the world, Just Stop Oil is backed by the US-based Climate Emergency Fund, set up to support disruptive environmental protests. Just Stop Oil activists have repeatedly staged multiple high-profile protests at the busiest highways and roads as well as sports tournaments. In July, British authorities expanded police power allowing them to target activists who stop traffic and to move static protests.",/en/culture/
"Disney+ adds 7 million subscribers, amid cost-cutting campaign","    In results released Wednesday, Disney said the company was pushing to cut costs by $7.5 billion, an increase from a previous pledge of $5.5 billion. In all, the entertainment giant posted sales of $21.24 billion for the period, up slightly on the previous year. ","Disney's streaming service has attracted nearly 7 million new subscribers, the company said on Wednesday, November 8, reversing a period of decline that had raised doubts about its rivalry with industry leader Netflix.Disney has been under significant pressure ever since CEO Bob Iger left the company only to be brought out of semi-retirement a year ago after his replacement no longer had the confidence of executives and the company board. Upon his return, Iger embarked on a cost-cutting campaign that saw major cuts to lavish spending to get Disney+ off the ground.Those efforts saw Disney's streaming losses contract to $387 million in the most recent quarter, down from $1.47 billion a year earlier. Disney Plus clients rose to 112.6 million at the end of September from 105.7 million at the end of June. ""Our results this quarter reflect the significant progress we've made over the past year,"" Iger said, pointing to the success of Disney+'s recently added ad-supported tier. ""While we still have work to do, these efforts have allowed us to move beyond this period of fixing and begin building our businesses again,"" Iger said.The solid quarter may bring back confidence in Iger who had begun to face criticism for his once-celebrated decisions such as paying massively in 2019 to buy 21st Century Fox from Rupert Murdoch.In the past year, the Disney share price has slumped around multi-year lows. Activist investor Nelson Peltz has turned the heat on Iger asking him to cut costs.In the results released Wednesday, Disney said the company was pushing to cut costs by $7.5 billion, an increase from a previous pledge of $5.5 billion. In all, the entertainment giant posted sales of $21.24 billion for the period, up slightly on the previous year, according to its earnings release on Wednesday.Disney last month said it will become the sole owner of Hulu, which it already markets in subscriptions that include its own Disney+ service and the ESPN+ sports content streaming platform.Hulu is Disney's arm for adult-focused programs such as The Handmaid's Tale, while family content falls under Disney+, launched four years ago. Both services, like their competitors, were hit by a historic writers' and actors' strike this summer, resulting in a huge backlog of Hollywood productions.""I can only say that I'm optimistic that we'll figure that out relatively soon,"" Iger told CNBC after the earnings release.",/en/culture/
Picasso's 'Woman with a Watch' fetches $139 million at auction,"    It's the second-highest price ever achieved for the artist. The 1932 painting depicts one of Picasso's companions and muses, the French painter Marie-Thérèse Walter. ","One of Pablo Picasso's masterpieces, Femme à la Montre (""Woman with a Watch"") was sold at auction Wednesday night, November 8, for $139.3 million by Sotheby's in New York, the second-highest price ever achieved for the artist.The 1932 painting depicts one of the Spanish artist's companions and muses, the French painter Marie-Thérèse Walter, and had been valued at over $120 million before going on the block, according to Sotheby's. The painting is part of Sotheby's special sale this week of the collection of the wealthy New York patron of the arts Emily Fisher Landau, who died this year at the age of 102.Julian Dawes, the house's head of impressionist and modern art, called the Picasso canvas ""a masterpiece by every measure."" ""Painted in 1932 – Picasso's 'annus mirabilis' – it is full of joyful, passionate abandon yet at the same time it is utterly considered and resolved,"" he said.Walter was considered Picasso's ""golden muse"" and features in another of his works going under the hammer on Thursday at Christie's: Femme Endormie (""Sleeping Woman""), estimated to sell for $25-$35 million.Walter met Picasso in Paris in 1927, when the Spaniard was still married to Russian-Ukrainian ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova, and when Walter was 17. She also featured in Femme assise près d'une fenêtre (Marie-Thérèse) (""Woman sitting by a window (Marie-Thérèse)""), which was sold in 2021 for $103.4 million by Christie's auction house.

Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak: '36% women at Paris Photo is still not enough',"    On the occasion of the annual photography fair, Abdul Malak spoke in an interview about her work on behalf of women photographers and the French scene. ","On the occasion of the 2023 Paris Photo fair, French Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak took stock of new donations by photographers to public institutions. She discussed the concerns raised by artificial intelligence and announced a new public commission for the 200th anniversary of the invention of photography.In 2022-2023, the French state received unprecedented donations, notably to the Bibliothèque Nationale de France [French National Library, BNF] and the Médiathèque du Patrimoine et de la Photographic [Heritage and Photography Media Library, which alone received 21 photographers' collections], including archives, prints and negatives. They received donations from photojournalists Christine Spengler and Gilles Caron; Magnum agency photographers Jean Gaumy and Patrick Zachmann; and artists such as Dolorès Marat, Denis Brihat, John and Claude Batho. Press photo collections have also been donated to the National Archives, such as the collection from [the newspaper] Libération, with 500,000 prints.France is the country that saw the birth of photography, and we maintain a strong attachment to this medium, which is the ""mirror of our memory,"" as Henri Cartier-Bresson once said. First and foremost, it's a relationship of trust with institutions that know how to both preserve and enhance their collections. I don't know any photographers who donate their work to keep it in storage! These donations are also a sign of Paris' dynamic position in the world of photography, with more open collaboration between public and private institutions.In 2018, 20% of the work exhibited was by women. Today, we're at 36%, but that's still not enough. There has been a general awakening. Still, we had to force the change a little – without ""ghettoizing"" women in a special section. By being presented throughout the fair, they are visible to private and public institutions, collectors and all visitors. But I am spreading this message everywhere. Les Rencontres d'Arles [an annual photography festival in southern France] has also given more space to women. I also wanted to develop residencies for women photographers, with a new program at the Cité Internationale des Arts.France's strength has always been in welcoming artists from all over the world. But when you're a public institution, you also have a role to play in promoting the French scene – in other words, the artists who live and work here. Yet the French scene is underrepresented in major institutions and festivals. We have insisted on this in our agreements with the entities we support. Intermediary venues, in particular those in the Diagonal network, play a major role. Their programming is 68% French people. We also want to double the number of residencies rooted in local areas by doubling the budget of the Capsule program to €320,000 and extending it to 28 venues.",/en/culture/
'The spectacular recovery of the US economy and job shortages have reawakened the ardor for demands among workers',"    In Hollywood, the actors' strike came to an end on Wednesday, after 118 days on the picket line. With an efficiency not seen in decades, industrial actions are multiplying in the country. ","Actors raise their fists, but they're not playing a role. After 118 days on strike, Hollywood actors have won the battle. They got the deal they were looking for with the country's four major studios – Disney, Warner, Netflix, Universal − as these CEOs came to the negotiating table. On Wednesday, November 8, they finally conceded to a pay rise of between 7 and 8% (the official figure has not been released), compensation for the use of their characters by artificial intelligence, and bonuses for successful films and series on streaming channels such as Netflix.Studios were in a hurry to put an end to this widely followed strike, which had already compromised Christmas releases and threatened the 2024 summer season. All the more so as this actors' strike followed that of the screenwriters, who had put down their pencils this summer and reached an agreement at the end of September. ""Perseverance pays off!"" exclaimed Oscar-winning actress Jamie Lee Curtis on Instagram. She could have said ""strikes pay off!"", as the number of industrial actions multiply in the country.This kind of efficiency has not been seen in decades. On the same November 8, employees at Caesar hotels, casinos and restaurants in Las Vegas reached an agreement just days before their union voted to strike. Not to mention the massive conflict that shook the automotive industry in September and October, culminating on October 30 in a highly advantageous agreement for workers at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis (Chrysler).They had all been preceded by the unions of the 340,000 UPS delivery drivers, who reached an agreement with management on July 25, a week before the start of a strike that promised to sow logistical chaos across the country. The spectacular recovery of the US economy and job shortages have suddenly reawakened the ardor for demands among workers who have had to make do with little in recent decades.All the more so as the flourishing health of America's major corporations has been a powerful argument in the multi-year negotiations, which began this year. UPS, for example, has seen its profits triple in 2021 and 2022, compared with pre-pandemic levels. More than $8 billion (€7.5 billion) has been returned to shareholders. No wonder employees are demanding their share. All the more so as they are encouraged to do so by President Joe Biden, who came in person to support the auto workers in Detroit. All the planets are aligned in a rare moment, one that won't happen again soon.",/en/culture/
"At Paris Photo, the  images move seamlessly from the real to the virtual","    For the first time, the fair has created a 'digital sector,' where artists  explore new technologies and the ways in which they have changed our lives. ","The Jean-Kenta Gauthier gallery stand at the Paris Photo fair, the world's leading still-image event taking place in the Grand Palais Ephémère until Sunday, November 12, might come as a surprise. There are no images, only words, in English. They have been inscribed on the walls by American artist David Horvitz, like haikus. ""Pebbles thrown into the sunset,"" ""Ela's shadow, days old."" Or just, ""Money."" These are the descriptions of personal, banal digital images that the artist has plucked from his archives and decided to erase for good. It is a poetic way of evoking the flood of images that characterizes our age, our mania for living every moment through instant photographs.This ""low tech"" work is paradoxically presented in the fair's new ""digital sector,"" which, for the first time, brings together artists working with digital technology. ""Visitors will no doubt find that it doesn't look very digital!"" said Swiss curator Nina Roehrs, who has brought together the work of some 30 artists on nine stands. ""This section concerns artists who use the digital as a tool, but also all those who are interested in the way it disrupts all our societies. The result can therefore take any digital or physical form,"" said Roehrs. ""The artists here range from the computer art pioneers of the 1950s-1960s to those working on artificial intelligence [AI]."" Paris Photo is currently one of the only fairs to have a section devoted to digital art, which doesn't surprise Roehrs: ""Photographers have been confronted with the arrival of digital for a long time now.""It is true that there are a few screens on site, but above all there are lots of photo prints, drawings, images on various media, sculptures, objects and even an arcade game reinvented by young Robbie Barrat, at the Avant Galerie. At the age of just 22, this American is, in fact, a historic artist of artificial intelligence and crypto art, a genre linked to blockchain technology (the blockchain enabling information to be stored and transmitted without a controlling body) .For his project The Big Buck Hunter, he pirated a famous hunting game that involved shooting deer with a rifle. ""It's a game I played as a child in West Virginia,"" he said, ""but I was struck by its violence. You only see the scenery for a few seconds, and the deer are perpetually on the run."" In his version, this game of death has become an environmental contemplation, with deer grazing peacefully in untouched nature. The work is only available in the form of the physical game, to be plugged in at home – Barrat could have edited scenes from the game as digital images, but he has resolutely given up on NFTs, non-fungible tokens, disgusted by the speculation around his works.",/en/culture/
"At 17, Ruth Orkin set out on her bike to photograph America",In pictures,"It took quite a dose of daring for a 17-year-old girl to cycle alone across the United States in 1939. Clearly, Ruth Orkin was no slouch when she set off on this solitary adventure of almost four months, from Los Angeles to New York, with her bicycle, her camera and $25 in her pocket.The exhibition ""Ruth Orkin, Bike Trip, USA, 1939,"" presented at the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris and accompanied by a book published by Textuel, revisits this unique journey in about 40 prints. The trip also marked the first series of images by the budding photographer – Orkin would later work for magazines and make films with her husband, Morris Engel.For the young woman, this journey was both a quest for emancipation and a feminist affirmation. One of her most vivid childhood memories is of an acrobatic flight demonstration by her idol, Amelia Earhart, the first woman pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic.Inventive and resourceful, the young Orkin managed to raise the small amount of money needed for her project by winning a prize in a competition for young designers organized by a women's magazine. The challenge was to come up with a new pattern for a fabric, and she had the idea of drawing stylized bicycles, elegantly intertwined and seen from above. Her design was even used to create a dress prototype.The teenager treasured her bike, nicknamed ""Hercules,"" an inseparable companion and symbol of her independence. In doing so, she followed in the footsteps of women who, since the 19th century, had used the bicycle as a means of achieving autonomy and reclaiming public space. In 1896, the American women's rights activist Susan B. Anthony claimed that the bicycle had ""done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.""To travel from west to east across the US, Orkin took the train, the bus or hitchhiked to the big cities, using her two-wheeler to get around on arrival – in June, she still managed to cover 180 kilometers in one day between Philadelphia and New York. At night, she relied on the network of youth hostels, which began popping up in the country in 1934.She quickly realized the importance of publicizing her journey. She contacted journalists in the towns where she stopped. They were all intrigued by her unique story. The resulting articles earned her invitations to trade fairs, free panniers for her bike and even a new bike. For each article, the young woman carefully staged herself – wearing a dress for the photo, for example.",/en/culture/

Archbishop of Barcelona Juan José Omella blessed the structures in the basilica on Sunday before the light show kicked off.The final two of the four Towers of the Evangelists, 135 meters (443 feet) high and dedicated to Matthew and John, were finished in September with the addition of figures representing a human bust and an eagle. The other two, dedicated to Luke and Mark and crowned by cow and lion sculptures, were completed last year.The towers will be the basilica's third highest once the site is completed. Only the Tower of Jesus Christ, designed by famous Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí to be the building's summit, remains unfinished. The developers expect to finish the tower in 2026, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of Gaudí's death.The basilica's construction committee initially set a 2026 target to complete the entire basilica, but the Covid-19 pandemic set back the project. The Sagrada Familia ""will be finished in 10 years maximum"" barring major problems, the head of the committee's board, Esteve Camps, told local newspaper La Vanguardia on Sunday.",/en/culture/
Isabelle Adjani releases second album after 40 years,"    The 'Pull Marine' singer unveiled 'Bande Originale,' conceived by Pascal Obispo alongside an all-male accompaniment. ","Joining the long list of actresses (Brigitte Bardot, Anna Karina, Mireille Darc, Jane Birkin, Catherine Deneuve) maestro Serge Gainsbourg loved to make sing, Isabelle Adjani put out a single self-titled album, released in 1983 – the very year she set the box office on fire with Jean Becker's L'Eté Meurtrier (One Deadly Summer). All that essentially remained of it was one hit, ""Pull Marine,"" and its widely circulated video by Luc Besson; a sad and beautiful little-known song (""Le Mal intérieur""); and two famous bits of wordplay (""J'suis dans un état proche de l'Ohio"" and ""Beau, oui comme Bowie""). Its release suffered from competing with Baby Alone in Babylone, the first album recorded by Jane Birkin after her separation from Gainsbourg, featuring the same team of British musicians. Even their themes were similar: chaos created by romantic relationships.After 40 years, Adjani is releasing an unexpected follow-up with Bande Originale, the fruit of her collaboration with Pascal Obispo and his lyricist Lionel Florence. Initiated in 2006, then suspended, the project resumed with the involvement of electronic musician DeLaurentis, aka Cécile Léogé. This chaotic gestation, mixing vintage and new vocal takes, finds cinematic unity right from the ""Prelude,"" with dramatic strings and the deep voice of Peter Murphy (lead singer of the British goth band Bauhaus) announcing ""l'histoire d'une actrice"" (""the story of an actress"").What follows is a series of long-distance duets with an all-male accompaniment. And a motley crew, to say the least, including French pop greats (Etienne Daho, as well as Benjamin Biolay for ""Il ne manque plus que tu me manques,"" a success); veterans of British new wave (Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran, and David Sylvian); and Senegalese star Youssou N'Dour, whose vocals are artificially laid over ""D'accord,"" as is rapper Akhenaton's flow on ""Seule."" Plus there are three ghostly contributions, from the late singers Christophe, Daniel Darc (with a line, ""J'ai menti pour m'en tirer"" – ""I lied to get away with it"" – that could have been written by Gainsbourg), and Philippe Pascal (from the groups Marquis de Sade and Marc Seberg). And then there's Obispo himself, whose vocal interventions add to the confusion.The overall emphasis on the atmosphere at the cost of melody is strongly colored by the 1980s and 1990s, with new age sounds (reminiscent of the music in Le Grand Bleu [The Big Blue], trip-hop and even French touch in ""Les Courants d'air,"" with the vocals of Adjani and Gaëtan Roussel treated with a vocoder in a nod to Daft Punk. After ""Samourai,"" the instrumental interlude ""Shamisen,"" named after the Japanese lute, steers the album toward a Japanese sound, solidified by ""Hara-Kiri,"" a Peter Gabriel pastiche with British returnee Seal, and ""Japan Airlines,"" with its introduction whispered by Adjani in the language of Mishima. More generally, it takes inspiration from the hybridizations of the composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, who died in March 2023.",/en/culture/
Madonna's Paris show: From Celebration to boredom,"    The American artist's Paris concert took in a career spanning 40 years. Madonna has three more shows in the French capital, on November 13, 19 and 20. ","Scheduled to kick off in mid-July and run through to October, the North American leg of Madonna's Celebration Tour was postponed due to her health problems, so the international tour began with the dates scheduled in Europe, starting on October 14 at London's O2 Arena.Rather than launching a new album, the show is a retrospective of a 40-year career – Madonna Louise Ciccone's debut album was released in July 1983.Sunday, November 12 at the Accor Arena was the first of four evenings on the Paris leg of a European tour that will end in early December. The venue's website lists a few tickets still on sale, for November 13, 19 and 20, ranging in price from €194 to €386.50.Nearly an hour and 40 minutes late, due to technical problems – the audience watched as cables and mini-projectors were pulled up on to high supports – the concert finally opened with the arrival of a showman in a Grand Siècle costume who built the mood, while images of Madonna at different periods of her career were projected on to screens. Finally, the woman herself appeared out of the smoke in a large black dress on the circular part of the stage, which extended partly into the pit, for Nothing Really Matters, a song from 1998.Aside from three or four moments with her daughter Mercy James on piano (for Bad Girl), her son David Banda on acoustic guitar, and a cellist, Madonna sang to pre-recorded tracks. But while there weren't many musicians on stage, there were plenty for the choreography – some 20 dancers in punk looks for Everybody and Into The Groove.This return to her early years, which she also revisitted in a speech, was followed by a rock treatment of Burning Up, then Open Your Heart and Holiday – an amusing sequence in which Madonna is turned away from the entrance to a nightclub while her comrades enter unhindered. A disco ball adds to the liveliness of this playlist of 1980s pop tracks. In stark contrast, Live To Tell follows, from the 1986 album True Blue. Madonna crosses the heights of the auditorium in a gondola, as black and white photographs of people close to the singer are projected on to screens, followed by hundreds of anonymous faces, all of whom died of AIDS.What follows this is more dubious. Officiants in monk's robes, a bell and a chorus in mock Latin announced Like A Prayer, with dancers doing acrobatics around luminous crucifixes. An unconvincing evocation of Prince is mixed in – the latter co-wrote Love Song with Madonna, which is not played.There's some downtime during interludes and costume changes, some of which are hard to understand – such as a depiction of desert dwellers fighting while a projection of Madonna as an Oriental queen looks on. The clichés of gay imagery are needlessly overplayed – feathers, latex, leather, policemen and cowboys, scantily clad athletes... A Madonna double strokes her crotch, and Madonna reciprocates. The whole thing lacks finesse.",/en/culture/
"1962 Ferrari sells for $51.7 million, the second most expensive car ever sold at auction",    The bright red roadster had been the property of an American collector for the past 38 years. ,"The Ferrari 250 GTO went on sale Monday evening after a few minutes of bidding in the auction room, but at a price lower than the more than $60 million expected by RM Sotheby's, the luxury car subsidiary of the auction house.   The bright red roadster's price was surpassed only by that of a Mercedes 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe that went for €135 million in 2022, the auction house said. That would be $144 million at today's exchange rate.Dating from 1962, this legendary Scuderia sports car – chassis 3765, four-liter engine developing 390 horsepower – had finished second in a 1,000 km endurance race on the German Nurburgring circuit, as well as in the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans, where the team had to withdraw due to engine failure, according to RM Sotheby's. After several years of competition on the Italian mainland and in Sicily, the car was sold and exported to the US in the late 1960s.Restored and modified, the 250 GTO changed American owners several times before ending up in the hands of an Ohio ""dedicated collector"" in 1985, who sold it on Monday. ""This stunning GTO offers its next caretaker further touring and vintage racing enjoyment, or display at major Concours d'élégance and marque gatherings worldwide,"" Sotheby's said.The Mercedes 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe that fetched €135 million in 2022 was one of only two examples of the sport car. It sold at a confidential auction at the German manufacturer's museum in Stuttgart and was the most expensive car ever sold worldwide, whether at auction or privately, a RM Sotheby's spokesman told Agence France-Presse.This week, New York auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's conclude their autumn season of art sales, which have not been affected by hard times and are raking in hundreds of millions of dollars. The market is driven by China and Asia and shows no signs of slowing down, according to Sotheby's, despite a tense international context.""Whatever happens in the financial markets, a car of this caliber is a collector's item, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" Michael Caimano of RM Sotheby's told AFP before the sale, comparing the Ferrari to a work of art that ""can be touched, felt and heard.""",/en/culture/
"'I was a kind of object and that's what I wanted to be': Jane Birkin, from 1969 to #MeToo","    Fifty years before #MeToo, a young Englishwoman sang a duet with an older Serge Gainsbourg. Sexual liberation had found an anthem and a muse. In 2019, at the age of 73, the artist drew up a bittersweet assessment of those years with Le Monde. Read the republished interview following the singer's death on July 16, 2023. ","This article was originally published by Le Monde in French in December 2019.Jane Birkin arrived in Paris just after May 1968 to shoot the film Slogan with Serge Gainsbourg. Their meeting became an affair. He took her to his room at his parents' home on Avenue Bugeaud in the fancy 16th arrondissement of Paris and played her the song Je t'aime... Moi non plus, (""I love you… me neither""), which was recorded with Brigitte Bardot, Gainsbourg's lover for a few months and whose photos lined the walls. He explained that Bardot was married and had refused to allow the song to be released. Finally, he proposed that Birkin cover it, and she said yes.They made the recording in a London studio. ""I go, I go and I come/between your loins/I go and I come inside you and I'm holding back."" Her sung response was an octave above that of Bardot, regarded then as the most beautiful woman in the world. ""No! Come now!"" Birkin sang. This was a century after Arthur Rimbaud's Sonnet du Trou du Cul (""Sonnet to the Asshole""), but it was enough for the head of the Phonogram label to tell them, ""I'm willing to go to jail for a long-play record, but not a short one!""Gainsbourg wrote 69 Année Érotique (""69, Erotic Year"") in the middle of the night. He wrote 10 tracks for the album that would be forbidden for under 18s, with only Jane Birkin's face on the cover. ""It was Serge who wanted me to be alone. He wanted me to have success in France."" It was more than success that she received: She became known for her androgynous body, for her big clear eyes and her heart-shaped lips. In other words, she became the embodiment of the sexual liberation that seemed to be contained in the album – an album that radio stations around the world didn't know how to handle.This was a long time ago. Année Érotique is now over 50 years old. Celebrating with 73-year-old Birkin, Le Monde was met with a smile and a sympathetic sigh. ""I can't speak for my era. The other girls were much freer than I was. There was no one more impressed by a man than I was. I was delighted to be Serge's object of desire, the person who inspired him. I was happy to take naked pictures. To be in Playboy, even though I wasn't their type at all. I was a kind of object and that's what I wanted to be. It's true, I don't know what it would be like today."" What is the significance of today? Other than the realization that female emancipation has moved at a much slower pace than sexual liberation. That there are tuxedo-clad aggressors on the red carpets of Cannes, as there are on every step of society. #MeToo has spread across social media, with women across the Western world denouncing and sharing their experiences and horrible memories.",/en/obituaries/
"Rothko, painter of the intimate and the intense","    In the abstract pieces he conceived after the war, which are on display at the Fondation Louis Vuitton until April 2, 2024, the American artist who rejected all labels sought to connect directly to the purity of human emotion. ","Mark Rothko was the antithesis of pop art – he witnessed its birth and had little appreciation for it – and the immediate imprint left by a painting that has more in common with the effectiveness of a poster than with the spirituality of an icon. Whereas a work by Andy Warhol is something you must submit to, a Rothko is something you immerse yourself in. You question it. And sometimes, in a sign that you've gone mad, it answers back... His paintings, especially those from his so-called ""classical"" period, are dangerous: They have the seductive power and beauty of the devil. When looking at his works, it's important to remember the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, of whom he was an avid reader: ""If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.""With very few exceptions, such as his 1954 tribute to Henri Matisse – L’'telier Rouge (""The Red Studio"") by the French painter, acquired by MoMA in 1949, was one of his favorite works – Rothko never titled his post-war paintings. The best he did was give them numbers, albeit in rarely coherent series. Nor did he define the periods of his work: His""multiforms,"" the first abstractions he created in 1946, and the last phase of his oeuvre (in the 1950s and 1960s), referred to by art historians under the surprisingly revolutionary term ""classic,"" were conventions created after the fact.Some also sought to classify him as one of the abstract expressionists who made the New York School of the 1950s such a phenomenon: A famous 1950 photograph by Nina Leen shows him sitting with them. They called themselves the ""irascible"" because they were protesting against what they saw as the disastrous choice of artists to represent modern American art in an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. All 15 of them stare scornfully into the lens, except for two: Hedda Sterne, the only woman in the group, who has a rather affectionate gaze, and Rothko, seen from three-quarters up, who seems to be elsewhere, as if detached. He felt that his would be a different destiny.As a matter of fact, he soon became detached, particularly from abstract expressionism, a term he violently rejected. Some painters also rejected him despite having been close friends: In 1955, for example, Barnett Newman (1905-1970) and Clyfford Still (1904-1980) went so far as to write to their shared art dealer, the gallery owner Sidney Janis, to criticize Rothko's work. The wound must have been especially deep as Rothko had worked hard to help Still, who had come from California, emerge on the New York scene, and because Rothko's transition to abstraction owes much to the example set by Still. ""The progression of a painter's work…will be toward clarity; toward the elimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea, and between the idea and the observer,"" he said in The Tiger's Eye magazine in 1949. ""To achieve this clarity is, inevitably, to be understood.""",/en/culture/
"Tony Bennett, last of classic American crooners, dies aged 96","    When he was 88, Bennett became the oldest person ever to reach number one on the US album sales chart. He died in New York, on Friday. ","Tony Bennett, the last in a generation of classic American crooners whose ceaselessly cheery spirit bridged generations to make him a hitmaker across seven decades, died Friday in New York. He was 96.Raised in an era when big bands defined US pop music, Bennett achieved an improbable second act when he started winning over young audiences in the 1990s – not by reinventing himself but by demonstrating his sheer joy in belting out the standards.And then at age 88, Bennett in 2014 became the oldest person ever to reach number one on the US album sales chart through a collection of duets with Lady Gaga – who became his friend and touring companion but only one of a long list of younger stars who rushed to work with the singing great.Likened since the start of his career to Frank Sinatra, Bennett first tried to distance himself but eventually followed much of the same path as other crooners of yore – singing in nightclubs, on television and for movies, although his attempts to act ended quickly.His gift proved to be his stage presence.With a welcoming smile and dapper suit, he sang with gusto and a smooth vibrato in a strong, clearly enunciated voice, which he kept in shape through training from the operatic Bel Canto tradition.Starting with his recording of the film song ""Because of You"" in 1951, Bennett sang dozens of hits including ""Rags to Riches,"" ""Stranger in Paradise"" and, in what would become his signature tune, ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco,"" which landed him two of his career's 19 Grammy Awards.Tony Bennett – his stage name came after advice from showbiz A-lister Bob Hope – was born Anthony Dominick Benedetto in the Astoria neighborhood of New York's Queens borough.His father was a struggling grocer who immigrated from southern Italy's Calabria region, to which his mother also traced her ancestry.He showed early promise as an entertainer, singing at age nine next to legendary New York mayor Fiorello LaGuardia when he ceremonially opened the city's Triborough Bridge, now known as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge.But his father's death at age 10, at a time when the United States was still struggling to exit the Great Depression, led him to leave school and earn money through jobs including singing at Italian restaurants and caricature painting, which remained a lifelong side career.During World War II, Bennett was drafted into the 63rd Infantry Division and was sent to France and Germany. But he was demoted after cursing out an officer from the South who objected to Bennett dining with an African American friend in the then racially segregated army.As punishment, Bennett spent his tour of duty digging out bodies and shipping them. But after the Allied victory, Bennett found an unexpected break into music as he waited with fellow troops in Wiesbaden, Germany to return home.With the city's opera house still intact, a US Army band performed a weekly show to be broadcast on military radio across Germany. Taken on as the band's librarian, Bennett quickly impressed with his voice and was made one of four vocalists.""During this period in the army, I enjoyed the most musical freedom I've ever had in my life,"" Bennett later wrote in his autobiography, The Good Life.""I could sing whatever I wanted, and there was no one around to tell me any different,"" he wrote.Bennett was married three times and had four children including Antonia Bennett, who has followed his path as a singer of pop and jazz standards.By the early 1990s, Bennett – his style and look little changed from the 1960s, except for more gray hair – was appearing in music videos on MTV and singing warm-up at concerts by alternative rock giants such as Smashing Pumpkins and Porno for Pyros.Proof that Bennett was back came in 1993 when he presented a prize at the MTV Video Music Awards alongside the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who hailed his cool factor and playfully sang part of ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco.""His career only kept building and a decade later, he released three successful albums of duets. On one of them, ""Body and Soul,"" he sang with Amy Winehouse in her last recording before she died in 2011 at age 27.He marked his 90th birthday with a star-studded concert at New York's Radio City Music Hall, which was turned into a television special and album.Upon turning 95, Bennett played two more birthday concerts, again at Radio City Music Hall, with Lady Gaga – shows billed as his farewell to New York.He then canceled the remainder of his 2021 tour dates on ""doctors' orders.""""And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing / And I will stay younger than spring,"" he crooned during the first of his farewell shows, in a rendition of his ballad ""This Is All I Ask.""""You've been a good audience,"" Bennett said prior to his encore. ""I love this audience.""",/en/obituaries/
Over a hundred American birds will soon be renamed,"    The American Ornithological Society wants to rename birds named after people, especially those with racist or offensive pasts, naming them instead for their physical characteristics. ","The Audubon shearwater is disappearing. The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List of Threatened Species has maintained that this bird is in no danger. Ornithology reference sites describe its presence across almost the entire American continent, from the northern Arctic to southern Brazil. However, in one or two years' time, this great sea traveler will no longer exist – at least under that name. On November 1, the American Ornithological Society (AOS) announced that it would be changing the common names of all birds on the continent ""named directly after people (eponyms), along with other names deemed offensive and exclusionary.""To the press release published by this scientific society, its president, Colleen Handel, added a personal statement: ""There is power in a name, and some English bird names have associations with the past that continue to be exclusionary and harmful today,"" she wrote. ""We need a much more inclusive and engaging scientific process that focuses attention on the unique features and beauty of the birds themselves."" From now on, common names will therefore reference the animals' physical characteristics or their habitat: White-faced shearwater, long-tailed shearwater, burrowing shearwater, etc. An open Community Congress hosted by the AOS' Diversity & Inclusion Committee was convened to inform the AOS Council's decisions.Admittedly, those American figures commemorated in the continent's winged animals' names have until now not all been the most commendable. In 2020, the research society had already renamed the thick-billed longspur – previously known as McCown's longspur. Honoring a Confederate general and defender of slavery in this way no longer seemed possible, regardless of his love of birds. Yet the list goes on. Didn't Scott's oriole commend another general, who – while loyal to the Union – was a commander in the Trail of Tears, the forced removal of native populations from their ancestral homelands, including the Cherokees? Additionally, should Townsend's warbler immortalize John Kirk Townsend (1809-1851), who hunted down birds in America's skies but also skulls in its indigenous peoples' graves?Painter and naturalist Jean-Jacques Audubon (John James Audubon to Americans, 1785-1851) has so far posed a problem of a rather different scale. On the face of things, he was the most celebrated figure in American ornithological history and the author of a considerable body of work. On the other side, he was a landowner and slaveholder who always opposed abolition. In March, the National Audubon Society decided to retain his name. The institution's staff union has abandoned it.",/en/science/
"Randy Meisner, founding member of the Eagles, dies at 77","    The singer of 'Take it to the Limit' died of complications from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the Eagles said. Meisner joined the band in the early 1970s to be part of one of the most popular acts in history. ","Randy Meisner, a founding member of the Eagles who added high harmonies to such favorites as ""Take It Easy"" and ""The Best of My Love"" and stepped out front for the waltz-time ballad ""Take It to the Limit"" has died, the band said on Thursday, July 27.Meisner died Wednesday night in Los Angeles of complications from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the Eagles said in a statement. He was 77. The bassist had endured numerous afflictions in recent years and personal tragedy in 2016 when his wife, Lana Rae Meisner, accidentally shot herself and died. Meanwhile, Randy Meisner had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had severe issues with alcohol, according to court records and comments made during a 2015 hearing in which a judge ordered Meisner to receive constant medical care.Called ""the sweetest man in the music business"" by former bandmate Don Felder, the baby-faced Meisner joined Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Bernie Leadon in the early 1970s to form a quintessential Los Angeles band and one of the most popular acts in history. ""Randy was an integral part of the Eagles and instrumental in the early success of the band,"" the Eagles' statement said. ""His vocal range was astonishing, as is evident on his signature ballad, 'Take It to the Limit.'""Evolving from country rock to hard rock, the Eagles turned out a run of hit singles and albums over the next decade, starting with ""Take It Easy"" and continuing with ""Desperado,"" ""Hotel California"" and ""Life In the Fast Lane"" among others. Although chastised by many critics as slick and superficial, the Eagles released two of the most popular albums of all time, Hotel California and Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) with sales at 38 million.Led by singer-songwriters Henley and Frey, the Eagles were initially branded as ""mellow"" and ""easy listening."" But by their third album, 1974's On the Border, they had added a rock guitarist, Felder, and were turning away from country and bluegrass.Leadon, an old-fashioned bluegrass picker, was unhappy with the new sound and left after the 1975 album One of These Nights. (He was replaced by another rock guitarist, Joe Walsh). Meisner stayed on through the 1976 release of Hotel California, the band’s most acclaimed record, but was gone soon after. His departure, ironically, was touched off by the song he co-wrote and was best known for, ""Take It to the Limit.""A shy Nebraskan torn between fame and family life, Meisner had been ill and homesick during the Hotel California tour (his first marriage was breaking up) and was reluctant to have the spotlight for ""Take It to the Limit,"" a showcase for his nasally tenor. His objections during a Knoxville, Tennessee concert in the summer of 1977 so angered Frey that the two argued backstage and Meisner left soon after. His replacement, Timothy B. Schmit, remained with the group over the following decades, along with Henley, Walsh and Frey, who died in 2016.As a solo artist, Meisner never approached the success of the Eagles, but did have hits with ""Hearts On Fire"" and ""Deep Inside My Heart"" and played on records by Walsh, James Taylor and Dan Fogelberg, among others.",/en/obituaries/
"Sinéad O'Connor, Irish singer, dies at 56",    The singer was known for hits like her cover of Prince's 'Nothing Compares 2 U' and for her strong voice and personality. ,"Sinéad O'Connor, the gifted Irish singer-songwriter who became a superstar in her mid-20s but was known as much for her private struggles and provocative actions as for her fierce and expressive music, has died at 56. ""It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Sinéad. Her family and friends are devastated and have requested privacy at this very difficult time,"" the singer's family said in a statement reported Wednesday, July 26, by the BBC and RTE, after initial reports by the Irish Times.""Her music was loved around the world and her talent was unmatched and beyond compare,"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a statement on social media.Recognizable by her shaved head and elfin features, O'Connor began her career singing on the streets of Dublin and soon rose to international fame. She was a star from her 1987 debut album The Lion and the Cobra and became a sensation in 1990 with her cover of Prince's ballad ""Nothing Compares 2 U,"" a seething, shattering performance that topped charts from Europe to Australia and was heightened by a promotional video featuring the gray-eyed O'Connor in intense close-up.""Nothing Compares 2 U"" received three Grammy nominations and was the featured track off her acclaimed album I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, which helped lead Rolling Stone to name her Artist of the Year in 1991. ""She proved that a recording artist could refuse to compromise and still connect with millions of listeners hungry for music of substance,"" the magazine declared.She was a lifelong non-conformist – she would say that she shaved her head in response to record executives pressuring her to be conventionally glamorous – but her political and cultural stances and troubled private life often overshadowed her music. She feuded with Frank Sinatra over her refusal to allow the playing of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at one of her shows and accused Prince of physically threatening her. In 1989 she declared her support for the Irish Republican Army, a statement she retracted a year later. Around the same time, she skipped the Grammy ceremony, saying it was too commercialized.A critic of the Catholic Church well before allegations sexual abuse were widely reported, O'Connor made headlines in October 1992 when she tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II while appearing live on NBC's Saturday Night Live and denounced the church as the enemy. Days later, she appeared at an all-star tribute for Bob Dylan at Madison Square Garden and was immediately booed. She was supposed to sing Dylan's ""I Believe in You,"" but switched to an a cappella version of Bob Marley's ""War,"" which she had sung on Saturday Night Live.In 1999, O'Connor caused uproar in Ireland when she became a priestess of the breakaway Latin Tridentine Church – a position that was not recognized by the mainstream Catholic Church. For many years, she called for a full investigation into the extent of the church's role in concealing child abuse by clergy. In 2010, when Pope Benedict XVI apologized to Ireland to atone for decades of abuse, O'Connor condemned the apology for not going far enough and called for Catholics to boycott Mass until there was a full investigation into the Vatican's role, which by 2018 was making international headlines.""People assumed I didn't believe in God. That's not the case at all. I'm Catholic by birth and culture and would be the first at the church door if the Vatican offered sincere reconciliation,"" she wrote in the Washington Post in 2010. O'Connor announced in 2018 that she had converted to Islam and would be adopting the name Shuhada' Davitt, later Shuhada Sadaqat – although she continued to use Sinéad O'Connor professionally.O'Connor was born on December 8, 1966. She had a difficult childhood, with a mother whom she alleged was abusive and encouraged her to shoplift. As a teenager she spent time in a church-sponsored institution for girls, where she said she washed priests' clothes for no wages. But a nun gave O'Connor her first guitar, and soon she sang and performed on the streets of Dublin, her influences ranging from Dylan to Siouxsie and the Banshees.Her performance with a local band caught the eye of a small record label, and, in 1987, O'Connor released The Lion and the Cobra, which sold hundreds of thousands of copies and featured the hit ""Mandinka,"" driven by a hard rock guitar riff and O'Connor's piercing vocals.""I suppose I've got to say that music saved me,"" she said in an interview with the Independent newspaper in 2013. ""I didn't have any other abilities, and there was no learning support for girls like me, not in Ireland at that time. It was either jail or music. I got lucky.""O'Connor's other musical credits included the albums Universal Mother and Faith and Courage, a cover of Cole Porter's ""You Do Something to Me"" from the AIDS fundraising album ""Red Hot + Blue"" and backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's ""Blood of Eden."" She received eight Grammy nominations overall and in 1991 won for best alternative musical performance.O'Connor announced she was retiring from music in 2003, but she continued to record new material. Her most recent album was ""I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss,"" released in 2014.The singer married four times; her union to drug counselor Barry Herridge, in 2011, lasted just 16 days. She was open about her private life, from her sexuality to her mental illness. She said she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and on social media wrote openly about taking her own life. When her teenage son Shane died by suicide in 2022, O'Connor tweeted there was ""no point living without him"" and was soon hospitalized.O'Connor had four children: Jake, with her first husband John Reynolds; Roisin, with John Waters; Shane, with Donal Lunny; and Yeshua Bonadio, with Frank Bonadio.",/en/obituaries/

This nose-thumbing at death did not prevent the latter's zeal, which caught up with the German writer Martin Walser in Uberlingen, Germany, on Friday, July 28. He was 96 years old. But the provocative spirit of this outstanding stylist had, for over 60 years, ""left a decisive mark on German literature,"" in the words of the tribute paid to him by Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the president of the Federal Republic of Germany. Often satirically, his works – novels, essays, and plays – reveal the anxieties of middle-class people caught between the benefits of German economic prosperity and a nagging sense of personal failure. A world he knew well because it was his own.Walser was born on March 24, 1927, in Wasserburg am Bodensee, south of Germany, a region he had never left. He had been living in Uberlingen since the 1960s. The son of an innkeeper, he was orphaned by his father at the age of 10. Memories of this childhood are recalled in Ein springender Brunnen (""A gushing fountain""), a novel in which Walser not only recounts tales of his childhood but also the rise and fall of the Third Reich.As a teenager during World War II, he served in air defense. According to documents in the Nazi party's central file, he joined the party on January 30, 1944. However, this never brought him the same setbacks as Günter Grass (1927-2015), who was exactly the same age and also joined the armed services before being assigned to an anti-aircraft battery as a Luftwaffe auxiliary. No doubt Grass had waited too long, until 2006, to make this coming out. He had, until then, presented himself too much as a lesson-giver. Walser, on the other hand, was never attacked on the subject. He had always denied being a Nazi.In 1947, at age 20, he began studying literature, history, and philosophy in Regensburg, Bavaria, and later in Tübingen. At the same time, from 1949 onwards, he worked as a reporter and editor for the Süddeutscher Rundfunk radio station in Stuttgart. In 1952, he defended an authoritative thesis on Kafka when the author was still far from popular.In 1953, he became one of the youngest members of Group 47 – named after the group's first meeting in Munich in 1947. It was a literary think-tank grouped around writer Hans Werner Richter (1908-1993), which called for ""new means of form, style, and literature.""In 1957, his first novel Marriage in Philippsburg was a huge success. In a new era where the economic miracle has repressed the memory of Nazi barbarism, young journalist Hans Beumann finds himself frolicking in a world where the important matter is to make a career and flaunt success by showing off what one has acquired: Money, houses, mistresses. With this novel, the barely 30-year-old writer painted a masterly portrait of the young German Federal Republic and its variable-geometry morality. The book quickly became one of the great novels of the post-war period, alongside The Hothouse by Wolfgang Koeppen, Billiards at Half-Past Nine by Heinrich Böll, and Grass' The Tin Drum.",/en/obituaries/
"Paul Reubens, actor behind 'Pee-wee Herman,' has died at age 70",    The artist behind the lasting absurdist character – who found popularity in both film and TV – was privately dealing with cancer over the last number of years. ,"Paul Reubens, the US comic who became famous in the 1980s for playing eccentric man-child Pee-wee Herman, and later infamous for his arrest at an adult theater, has died aged 70.Mr. Reubens passed away Sunday, July 30, after a six-year battle with cancer which he had not publicly disclosed, according to a statement on the actor's official social media accounts.""Last night we said farewell to Paul Reubens, an iconic American actor, comedian, writer and producer whose beloved character Pee-wee Herman delighted generations of children and adults with his positivity, whimsy and belief in the importance of kindness,"" it said.""Paul bravely and privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit.""A Facebook post included a quotation posthumously attributed to Mr. Reubens.""Please accept my apology for not going public with what I've been facing the last six years,"" the quote read.Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel led the tributes, calling Mr. Reubens ""a brilliant and original comedian who made kids and their parents laugh at the same time.""""He never forgot a birthday and shared his genuine delight for silliness with everyone he met. My family and I will miss him,"" Mr. Kimmel posted on social media.Born in New York state in 1952, Mr. Reubens launched his career as a comedian in Los Angeles in the 1970s.He introduced his most famous bow-tie-wearing persona in a 1980 stage show called The Pee-wee Herman Show.The production was a hit and led to an HBO special the following year.In 1985, Mr. Reubens teamed up with director Tim Burton to bring his character to the big screen, starring in Pee-wee's Big Adventure.Pee-wee's Playhouse became a US television sensation, running from 1986 to 1990, with Mr. Reubens staying in character during interviews throughout its duration.But in 1991, his career was dramatically derailed after he was arrested at an adult theater in Florida, and pleaded no contest to indecent exposure.The scandal was widely covered, and Mr. Reubens largely disappeared from the public eye for several years.He later had minor roles in films such as Blow, starring Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz, and television shows including The Blacklist, 30 Rock and Ally McBeal.He also reprised the character of Pee-wee Herman in a number of television appearances, a stage show revival that went to Broadway, and the 2016 Netflix film Pee-wee's Big Holiday.""I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters,"" said Mr. Reubens' posthumous quote.""I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you.""",/en/obituaries/
2023 Goncourt prize awarded to Jean-Baptiste Andrea,    France's most prestigious literary award recognized Jean-Baptiste Andrea for his novel 'Veiller sur elle' ('Watch Over Her'). Ann Scott won the competing Renaudot award for 'Les insolents' ('The insolent'). ,"France's top literary prize, the Goncourt, was awarded Tuesday to former film director Jean-Baptiste Andrea for his novel Veiller sur elle (""Watch Over Her"") set in Italy's dark fascist years.Andrea beat off the favorite, Eric Reinhardt's stylistically bold novel about a woman's decline after leaving her family. Reinhardt's Sarah, Susanne et l'écrivain (""Sarah, Susanne and the Writer"") tells the story of a woman driven to despair by an awful husband.In a sign of the tightness of the race, the jury awarded the prize only on the 14th round of voting. ""It's a very emotional moment, I have been drying my tears in the taxi,"" Andrea said as he arrived at the restaurant.Andrea, 52, has made an impact in the English-speaking world with two well-received translations, A Hundred Million Years and a Day and Devils and Saints. His latest 600-page epic focuses on a sculptor and his romance with a woman from a much wealthier background.Andrea has forged an unusual path, starting off as a screenwriter and film director in a career in cinema saw him make a handful of movies including the 2006 black comedy Big Nothing starring the famed Friends actor David Schwimmer. He turned to novels relatively late in his 40s, with his first book published in 2017. Watch Over Her is his fourth novel.""I wanted to write something bigger than what I had written before, to leave behind all the limits that I had initially imposed on myself in 20 years of cinema... but which I had also paradoxically imposed on my first three novels,"" he told France Inter radio in late October. ""It's a homage to Italy, the country of my ancestors,"" he added.In a century-old tradition, the Goncourt winner is revealed at lunchtime at the Drouant restaurant in central Paris. As well as prestige, the award guarantees a boost in sales – on average over the past 20 years, to around 400,000 copies.There are four finalists each year for the prize. Also in contention was Gaspard Koenig, who had previously focused on philosophical essays, and won many fans with Humus, the story of two young agricultural activists opposed to intensive farming.But one of the contenders, Neige Sinno, had no chance of winning thanks to a long-running rivalry with another award, the Prix Femina, which was created one year after the Goncourt in 1904 to challenge the open sexism of its founders, Jules and Edmond de Goncourt. Sinno won the Prix Femina on Monday for her story of incest and sexual violence, Triste tigre (""Sad Tiger"") – effectively ruling her out of the Goncourt by the unwritten rules of the rivalry.Immediately after the Goncourt, and also at the Drouant restaurant, is the awarding of the Renaudot, a much more unpredictable prize. Initially started as a joke in the 1920s by journalists killing time while waiting for the Goncourt jury, the Renaudot is now considered one of France's top awards.That award went to cult novelist Ann Scott for her novel Les insolents (""The insolent"") about a woman in her forties who leaves Paris to reinvent her life. In an eclectic career, Scott was a model, a drummer in a punk band and regular on the underground Parisian night scene. She started writing at the age of 29, notably writing the novels Asphyxia and then Superstars.",/en/culture/
"Angus Cloud, breakout star of 'Euphoria,' is dead at 25","    The actor, beloved for his portrayal of Fezco on the hit HBO drama, recently lost his father and 'was open about his battle with mental health,' according to a family statement. ","Angus Cloud, the 25-year-old costar of hit HBO drama Euphoria, died on Monday, July 31, his family said.No cause of death was given for the actor, who portrayed laconic drug dealer Fezco ""Fez"" O'Neill in the multiple Emmy Award-winning series.A statement said Mr. Cloud had been struggling to deal with the recent passing of his father, and had experienced ongoing mental health issues.""The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend,"" said his family, in a statement sent by Mr. Cloud's publicist.""Angus was open about his battle with mental health and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence.""Euphoria, fronted by Zendaya, is one of the most-watched HBO series of all time.The show has drawn controversy as well as plaudits for its dark depiction of the issues facing contemporary American teens, including drug addiction and sexual violence.It was Mr. Cloud's first acting job, having been discovered by a casting director while walking through the streets of Brooklyn, New York with friends.""We hope the world remembers him for his humor, laughter and love for everyone.

"Sophie Fillières, director of zany French comedies, has died at 58",    The French filmmaker and screenwriter behind 'Ouch' and 'Gentille' died on July 31. ,"Cinema can sometimes be used to invent a less rigid life, as the unclassifiable, high-minded comedies of French filmmaker Sophie Fillières were tirelessly striving to do.The filmmaker and screenwriter died on Monday, July 31, at 58, having just finished shooting her seventh feature film, Ma vie, ma gueule, with Agnès Jaoui and Philippe Katerine. Alongside Arnaud Desplechin, Noémie Lvovsky and Pascale Ferran, she was a worthy representative of the ""young French cinema"" of the 1990s, a graduate of the French national film school La Fémis and a product of the French New Wave, blending intimacy and romance. Fillières achieved this in her own very personal way: a dazzling back-and-forth in dialogue, a freewheeling burlesque of speech. Her wavering lovers – Judith Godrèche in Grande petite (1994), André Dussollier in Aïe (Ouch, 2000), Emmanuelle Devos in Gentille (2005) – are given to wild fabrication, building castles in the air, creating their stories through the sheer force of words.Born in Paris on November 20, 1964, to an Air France salesman and a math-teacher-turned-painter mother, Fillières was marked at the age of 16 by the discovery of Sauve qui peut (La vie) (Every Man for Himself), by Jean-Luc Godard. She entered La Fémis film school, the successor to the Institute for Advanced Cinematographic Studies, as a student director in 1986, and was a member of the very first graduating class in 1990 (along with Solveig Anspach, Emilie Deleuze, Arnaud des Pallières and Emmanuelle Demoris), under the influence of new cultural policies.She made a name for herself with her first short, Des filles et des chiens (""Of Girls and Dogs"", 1991), winner of the 1992 Jean Vigo prize, which opened as a double feature with Arnaud Desplechin's La Sentinelle (The Sentinel, 1992), laying the foundations for her style of cinema. Two girls, Sandrine Kiberlain and Hélène Fillières (her younger sister), walk down the street, idly speculating – ""Would you rather have a car accident and end up disfigured, or have your parents divorce?"" In five minutes, the two friends have exhausted the most improbable situations.She first made her mark as a contributor to other people's screenplays, co-writing Nord (North, 1991) by Xavier Beauvois, Oublie-moi (Forget Me, 1994) by Noémie Lvovsky, and Sombre (Somber, 1998) by Philippe Grandrieux. She continued to work as a rewriter throughout her career, most recently on Nicolas Maury's Garçon Chiffon (My Best Part, 2020). Her transition to feature films came in 1994 with Grande petite: the strange story of a babysitter who, one fine day, discovers a wad of banknotes and a gun in a plastic bag, a thriller which she uses to further confuse the threads of her love life. Audacious, but still somewhat hypothetical, this oxymoron paved the way for the psychotic, delirious comedies that followed.",/en/obituaries/
"Geneviève de Fontenay, former president of the Miss France Committee, has died","    The emblematic figure of the Miss France pageant, nicknamed the 'Lady in the Hat,' died at the age of 90. ","Geneviève de Fontenay, former president of the Miss France committee, died at the age of 90, her son Xavier de Fontenay told the TF1 broadcaster on Wednesday, August 2. Born Geneviève Mullmann on August 30, 1932, in Longwy, eastern France, she was the eldest of 10 siblings. Her father, André, was a mining engineer at the Hagondange steelworks, while her mother, Marie-Thérèse, was a housewife and devout Catholic. Geneviève de Fontenay had an uneventful childhood with loving parents and a strict upbringing. Without much enthusiasm, she first enrolled at the hospitality management school in Strasbourg, but left at the age of 17 to attend a cosmetology school in Paris, and was later hired as an itinerant beautician.In 1952, she met the organizer of Miss France, Louis Poirot, known as ""de Fontenay,"" his pseudonym as a member of the French Resistance. It was at the Miss Carnac contest where she won an amateur model-making competition with him. She got back in touch with him in 1954. From then on, they never left each other's side, chose never to marry and had two sons, Ludovic – who died in 1984, aged 29 – and Xavier.She became secretary of the Miss France Committee in 1954, taking on many roles as chauffeur, steward, coach and costume designer, while her partner who was 24 years older was in charge of communications and presenting the election. Together, they crisscrossed France for more than 24 years, organizing elections and galas and driving their Citroën DS along the roads and through the countryside.When de Fontenay died in 1981 at the age of 73, Geneviève de Fontenay took over the reins of the Miss France Committee from her son Xavier, who became director of the Miss France company. As a Miss France salesperson, she hit the road again each season, covering more than 30,000 kilometers across France, expressing her love for the country's ""tradition, farmers and simple people."" It took a long time for this small business to become profitable, but on New Year's Eve 1986, the slightly old-fashioned regional show received unprecedented media coverage when TV presenter Guy Lux decided to broadcast the Miss France election live on FR3. The show was an immediate success and was broadcast in prime time on TF1 from 1995 onward. Every year, this television event is a hit, with audiences of between 12 and 15 million viewers.In 2002, her son Xavier decided to make a profit by selling the Miss France company to the reality TV production company Endemol, while retaining his title of director and Geneviève de Fontenay's role as president of the Miss France committee and deputy director.In 2004, former Miss France winner Sylvie Tellier took over the management of Endemol. Profound disagreements arose between the president-for-life and the company: Classicism imbued with traditional values on side, against a desire for modernism on the other – with the bikini replacing the legendary one-piece swimsuit. The ""Lady with the Hat,"" as she was nicknamed, argued that the Miss France brand was marked by ""deep-rooted France of the provinces, which acts as a counterbalance to that disheveled France."" Weary of all these changes, which she deemed vulgar, she finally abdicated in 2011 and launched a dissident pageant, Miss National, which was renamed Miss Prestige National after a court ruling.At the age of 83, de Fontenay announced her retirement from the fifth edition of Miss Prestige National, having worked for over 60 years to promote her conservative vision of French elegance. A favorite of the media, she continued to enjoy great popularity with the public and made frequent television appearances, even though times have changed and feminist organizations have repeatedly voiced their opposition to electing young women on the basis of their looks.",/en/obituaries/
"Henri Konan Bédié, former president and Machiavellian figure of Côte d'Ivoire, has died",    The leader of the Côte d'Ivoire Democratic Party died in Abidjan at the age of 89. He was one of the most powerful figures in the country's political life for half a century. ,"As if Henri Konan Bédié had almost escaped his human condition, few expected the 89-year-old's death on Tuesday, August 1. The former president of Côte d'Ivoire, who ruled between 1993 and 1999, was still the all-powerful master of the PDCI-RDA and one of the pillars of the country's political life. Known for his silence and calm, Bédié was preparing for the municipal and regional elections on September 2 and for his party's congress in October – two decisive events for the future of the PDCI in light of the 2025 presidential elections.As soon as Bédié's death was announced in Abidjan, where he had been rushed by helicopter from his fiefdom in Daoukro, central Côte d'Ivoire, a few hours earlier, dozens of PDCI-RDA supporters gathered at his villa in the Cocody district. ""I can't believe it because the day before yesterday, I was with him in Daoukro, we had lunch and talked together, he wasn't tired, he was in great shape, we took photos together. We were preparing for the elections with him, so it's a real blow,"" said Cyril Yobouet, coordinator of PDCI-RDA organizations.""I couldn't believe it, that's why I came here. We're going back into the field and we're going to ask our supporters to make sure that the PDCI-RDA wins the elections to pay this last tribute to our president,"" said Innocent Kouamé Kouassi, a candidate in the municipal elections in the town of Guitry, 150 km west of Abidjan.Born on May 5, 1934 in the village of Dadiékro, in the center of the country, ""N'Zueba"" (the child of rain, in Boulé) rose through the ranks rapidly. In the 1960s he joined the ""father of independence,"" Félix Houphouët-Boigny, in the PDCI-RDA, which was the sole party at the time.Aged only 26 he became Côte d'Ivoire's first ambassador to the US and Canada was later made the minister of the economy and finances at age 32. In 1980, he became president of the National Assembly, a position he held until 1993, when Houphouët-Boigny died. It was then that his conflict with Alassane Ouattara began, as both were vying to succeed the first Ivorian president. Their rivalry would never end.""HKB"" served as interim president until the 1995 elections. These two years were marked by an economic crisis, linked in particular to the downturn in the cocoa industry. Bédié promoted the controversial concept of ""ivoirité,"" a form of patriotism glorifying cultural identity and sovereignty that he also used as a pretext to suppress Muslim populations in the north. Bédié was accused of using ""ivoirité"" to disqualify Ouattara.",/en/obituaries/
"Konrad Klapheck, a painter who colored outside the lines, has died","    The German artist, who was one of the first to inscribe the power of machines in art, died on July 30 at the age of 88. ","German painter Konrad Klapheck passed away in his sleep on Sunday, July 30, in Düsseldorf, at the age of 88. Having suffered from Parkinson's disease for several years, he had stopped painting.Klapheck was born in Düsseldorf on February 10, 1935, to art historians. His father, Richard, was expelled from Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, the city's academy of fine arts, in 1934 by the Nazis and died shortly before the war. Konrad and his mother survived the bombing of Leipzig, where they had taken refuge. He then returned to his hometown in 1945. In 1954, he enrolled at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf and showed an interest in Surrealism when he visited Max Ernst in Paris that same year. ""I knew Pollock and Wols, I flirted with Art Informel, Tachisme and dripping,"" he said in 2005, recalling that period of his life.But rather than joining the trend, he radically opposed it. At the age of 20, in 1955, Klapheck decided to paint a typewriter as accurately as possible. The mechanical subject and the smooth, neutral style were the exact opposite of the celebration of the gestural and the unconscious, which were the hallmark of American action painting and European abstraction. Klapheck was one of the first to tackle this, and to inscribe the omnipotence and omnipresence of machines in art, a few years ahead of Parisian New Realism and New York Pop Art, which began to emerge in 1960. Although he was aware of what these artists had in common with him, Klapheck nevertheless kept his distance: ""I got on well with Klein and Arman. But they didn't invite me to join them,"" he said.He did not mind, because his first solo exhibition, in 1959 at the Galerie Schmela, also in Düsseldorf, was a success. He had established his own style and iconography. With the precision of an engineer, he depicted irons, sewing machines, punch presses, gas masks and Swiss Army knives, enlarged on canvases much bigger than the objects themselves and set against immaculate monochrome backgrounds. No power cords or metal cogs or joints were missing. The connection with Duchamp's ""machines célibataires"" (""bachelor machines"") was blatantly obvious, no less so than the connection with the torture device for condemned prisoners described by Kafka in his short story ""In the Penal Colony"" (1919). Without ever giving in to pathos, Klapheck invented the ironic art of technical cruelty.When he met André Breton in 1961, Klapheck found in him both a collector and an advocate: Breton wrote the preface for Klapheck's exhibition at the Ileana Sonnabend Gallery in Paris in 1965; included him in his selection of the 10 young artists most representative of the period; and invited him to take part in the exhibition ""L'Ecart absolu"" (""Absolute Deviation""), which was the last exhibition designed by Breton before his death. The surrealist tone of Klapheck's work was all the more noticeable given the titles he chose for his canvases, which sound like something that De Chirico or Magritte might have created: ""The Will to Power"" for a calculator, ""The Voice of Conscience"" for a machine tool and ""Splendor and Misery of the Reforms"" for a bulldozer. The connections with narrative figuration – with Telemachus in particular – and with hyperrealism were also strong. His work was frequently exhibited in Germany and Paris and occasionally in New York.",/en/obituaries/
"Hélène Carrère d'Encausse, first woman to head the Académie Française, has died","    The historian, who was the third female member of the institution and elected permanent secretary in 1999, died aged 94. ","Hélène Carrère d'Encausse, a historian of Tsarist and Soviet Russia and the third female member of the Académie Française, where she was the first woman to be elected permanent secretary in 1999, has died aged 94, her family announced on Saturday, August 5.Born Hélène Zourabichvili in Paris on July 6, 1929, to a Russian mother and a Georgian father, she arrived at a time when the fortune enjoyed by the Zourabichvili family a few decades earlier had become a mere memory – the fate of emigrants who had fled the Bolshevik revolution.The family had been great servants to the Romanov empire, as well as eminent scholars. They came from Georgia via Istanbul, and settled in France after the Soviet army invaded the fledgling Democratic Republic of Georgia in the late winter of 1921, less than three years after its birth on the ruins of the Tsarist empire. In 1936, the family expanded with the birth of Nicolas, who studied with Nadia Boulanger and went on to compose for both classical ensembles and the cinema, notably for Otar Iosseliani.Hélène learned to read at an early age, first French and then Russian, becoming familiar with the literature of both. Her father, Georges, a philosopher with a degree in political economy who became a cab driver before trying his hand at the import-export business, took the family to Bordeaux, where his mastery of five languages proved invaluable. But, working as an interpreter for the Germans during the Occupation, he was kidnapped during the Liberation, disappearing in October 1944 when he was probably killed.Returning to Paris with her mother, the teenaged Hélène was housed in the Russian Orthodox cathedral on Rue Daru. French neo-fascist journalist Maurice Bardèche, brother-in-law of collaborationist writer Robert Brasillach, met her in February 1950 and became attached to the girl who seemed to share his sense of ""anger and revolt"". In his book Souvenirs (1993), he wrote: ""She had the soul of a young heroine, but at the same time she was realistic, determined, lucid.""Despite this radical portrait, Hélène received a solid education at the Lycée Molière, then at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris. Born stateless, when she came of age she obtained French nationality. This was a momentous occasion for her and she wanted to take her oath on the flag, so she was appalled to learn that simply by not opposing naturalization before her 21st birthday, she had already become French by default – a fact she remembered when, in 1987, she was asked to sit on the commission for the reform of the nationality code.",/en/obituaries/
"William Friedkin, Oscar-winning director of 'The French Connection' and 'The Exorcist', is dead at 87",    Friedkin was hailed as a leading member of a new generation of filmmakers. ,"William Friedkin, the Oscar-winning director who became a top filmmaker in his 30s with the gripping The French Connection and the horrifying The Exorcist and struggled in the following decades to match his early success has died. He was 87.Friedkin, who won the Best Director Oscar for The French Connection, died on Monday, August 7, Los Angeles, his wife, producer and former studio head Sherry Lansing told The Hollywood Reporter.The movie, based on a true story, deals with the efforts of maverick New York City police Detective James ""Popeye"" Doyle to track down Frenchman Fernando Rey, mastermind of a large drug pipeline funneling heroin into the United States. It contains one of the most thrilling chase scenes ever filmed.The movie also won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Screenplay and Film Editing and led critics to hail Friedkin, then just 32, as a leading member of a new generation of filmmakers. He followed with an even bigger blockbuster, The Exorcist, based on William Peter Blatty’s best-selling novel about a 12-year-old girl possessed by the devil.The harrowing scenes of the girl’s possession and a splendid cast, including Linda Blair as the girl, Ellen Burstyn as her mother and Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller as the priests who try to exorcise the devil from her, helped make the film a box-office sensation. It was so scary for its era that many viewers fled the theater before it was over and some reported being unable to sleep for days afterward.It received 10 Oscar nominations, including one for Friedkin as director, and won two, for Blatty’s script and for sound.With that second success, Friedkin would go on to direct movies and TV shows well into the 21st century. But he would never again come close to matching the success of those early works.",/en/obituaries/
"John Guez, the 'maestro' of Beaubourg, has died","    The artist long embodied the art of street theater in front of the Centre Pompidou in Paris. He died in Paris on August 2, at the age of 81. ","Born in Tunis on January 3, 1942, John Gilbert Youssef Guez, known as John Guez, passed away in Paris on Wednesday, August 2, at the age of 81. With a handsome face, childlike flexibility and energy, and an uncanny class, John Guez was a street performer and entertainer between 1977 and 2006. He was a fixture outside the Centre Georges-Pompidou from the moment it opened, regularly posted at the Place Edmond-Michelet in Paris's 4th arrondissement. The neighborhood, known as Beaubourg, had been home to the heyday of street theater since the 1960s (with the Living Theatre and Dario Fo), but Guez took the art form to one of its greatest peaks. The other artists in the square called him ""il Maestro.""Actors (Michel Piccoli, Michael Lonsdale, among others) used to slip incognito into the audience, a circle (sometimes a square) made up of ordinary passers-by, tourists, foreigners, lovers and lost souls from all over, whom Guez was skilled at gathering around him. His only prop was a bamboo wand, which he would use to summon the police, Sarkozy or God. Guez could spontaneously gather a crowd, maybe 100 or 200 passers-by, and get them to act. In a light-colored suit or white jacket, with his clothes elegantly rumpled, adding a spotlessly clean Columbo-style raincoat in the winter, Guez would run and jump with grace, summoning someone here and there from the spontaneous circle and directing them as if by magic.Straddling the line between improv and comedy, the artist knew how to translate his talents as an entertainer into lessons of civic awareness. An actor, author and director, his work was rooted in medieval mysteries, the commedia dell'arte, Enfants du Paradis (Children of Paradise), and more. A lesson in theater, a bit of group therapy, a rare moment of collective laughter was transformed into civic reflection. At times, it escalated. Guez had indignation on the tip of his tongue, quick to put down social injustice, domination and war, while celebrating nurses, childhood and French public school – all without being bitter or pompous.The method was simple: embarking on a spontaneous adaptation of Les Misérables, he would randomly recruit apprentice actors from the audience. No one ever refused the invitation. There were some inspired Cosettes, some British Jean Valjeans who had to play in French, some uncooperative princes, little boys full of promise, a very determined African in the role of Thénardier, and a lady holding her purse in the role of Madame Thénardier.",/en/obituaries/
"Gilles Perrault, author of 'The Red Sweater', has died aged 92","    The son of members of the French Resistance, the author wrote of hidden lives and secret histories, publishing 50 books, many of which have been translated and adapted for the screen. ","Born in Paris on March 9, 1931, Gilles Perrault (who was born Jacques Peyroles) died on August 3, 2023, in Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, the Normandy village where he chose to live with his second wife in 1961. Sitting between the church and the war memorial, his house, the exterior wall riddled with bullets, became for him a place of remembrance. He loved to walk along the D-Day beaches every day, remembering the heroic moments of June 6, 1944, to which he devoted so many pages – most notably in Le Secret du jour J (The Secrets of D-Day), published in 1964.A popular writer with a lyrical pen and an incisive style, a blend of Norman Mailer and John le Carré, he was the author of some 50 books, some of which were translated worldwide and some which were made into films by Michel Deville, André Téchiné and Jacques Rouffio.Perrault's admiration for his mother, Germaine Merlot-Peyroles, knew no bounds. And with good reason: a left-wing lawyer and Dreyfusist who joined the Resistance with her husband in June 1940, she was one of the Republic's first elected women. Throughout his childhood, the young boy was confronted with the ordeal of a clandestine existence, forced to silently decipher a reality based on the principle of a double life.From this period, he retained not only a taste for secrecy but above all a precocious desire to shed light on subterranean lives, both sublime and abject: those of intelligence and espionage networks. Perrault would always choose his camp: that of the resistance fighters, whatever their moral turpitude, against that of the collaborationists, whatever their art of seduction. In 2014's Dictionnaire amoureux de la Résistance (""Loving Dictionary of the Resistance"") he wrote: ""To join the resistance is to sign up for torture and death. Never has heroism been such a daily occurrence; never has treason spilled so much blood and tears.""Educated at the Collège Stanislas in Paris, then at Sciences Po, he embarked on a career as a lawyer, which he abandoned after five years to make a living from his writing, after enlisting in Algeria in 1955, in the eighth colonial parachute regiment. He recounted this experience in the book that would make him famous, Les Parachutistes (""The Paratroopers""), in 1961, in which he painted a terrible picture of the despair of a generation of soldiers. He came out of it devastated, and solidly anti-colonial.It was the publication of L'Orchestre rouge (The Red Orchestra) in 1967 that made his name. In this rigorously researched bestseller, he recounted the little-known adventure of one of the largest anti-Nazi networks, founded by Leopold Trepper, of strict Soviet allegiance, which rallied Europeans of all nationalities. Most of the 70 members were tortured, deported or executed, including 19 women.",/en/obituaries/
"Federico Bahamontes, winner of the 1959 Tour de France, has died","    The 'Eagle of Toledo,' one of cycling's greatest climbers and the first Spaniard to win the Tour, died on Tuesday, aged 95. ","They say you never forget how to ride a bicycle. Federico Bahamontes put his away for good when he retired from the peloton in 1965. To maintain the legend he built and maintained with great care, the Spaniard swore he'd only ridden once after that. It was a sad day in May 1994, for a final tribute to Luis Ocaña, winner of the Tour de France in 1973.Bahamontes died on Tuesday, August 8 at the age of 95, Toledo mayor Carlos Velasquez announced on social media. Born on July 9, 1928, in Val de Santo Domingo, Toledo province, he joins his compatriot Ocaña but also most of his rivals, friends and enemies, of yesterday: Louison Bobet, Jacques Anquetil, Roger Rivière, Gastone Nencini, Charly Gaul, Raymond Poulidor...Winner of the 1959 Tour de France, ""the Eagle of Toledo"" – as he was described in 1957 by Jacques Goddet, the race's director – was the oldest living Tour winner. He had plenty of time to recount his great victories and defeats with a profusion of details, anecdotes and excuses typical of champions from an era of which little was broadcast on television.""As a tribute to my Tour victory, I was the first to ride my bike on the pitch of the Bernabeu [Real Madrid's stadium],"" he used to say, as if to remind us of his pioneering role. As the first Spanish winner of the Tour, he inspired the Fuente and Ocaña brothers in the 1970s and planted the seed that would later allow the triumphant Spain of Pedro Delgado, Miguel Indurain and Alberto Contador to flourish.If ""Spanish climber"" has long sounded like a tautology, it's because Bahamontes shaped their reputation. As a young cyclist, he owed his qualities to the topography of his city: perched on a hill above the Tagus, the capital of Castilla-La Mancha offered the ideal terrain to develop climbers. Apprenticed in a bicycle repair shop, the teenager began to work his legs by working as a courier for Toledo's shopkeepers. L'Equipe journalist Pierre Chany compared his suppleness to that of a ""flamenco dancer"" when he saw him shimmy his long, lean body up the steep slopes of the Alps and Pyrenees.Bahamontes also lived up to his reputation as a whimsical, even fanciful, rider. During his first Tour de France in 1954, he took the lead at the summit of the Col de Romeyère in the Alps, and took the time to enjoy an ice cream while waiting for his pursuers. No matter how often he insisted that he had allowed himself this ice cream break while waiting for mechanical assistance, the legend settled in.The climber, who loved high gradients, was sublime one day, and quickly resigned the next, lacking interest in the overall race, which demands consistent efforts. He won the mountains classification six times, a record beaten only by Richard Virenque, who won it a seventh time in 2004. The Spaniard's pride took a hit. He said the Frenchman lacked the explosiveness and class of the great mountain conquerers like himself: ""He's no match for me. I hope he doesn't mind, but if he's a climber, I'm Napoleon.""Bahamontes's finest hour on the Tour de France came in 1959. Having finished just short of the podium three years earlier, his hopes were dashed in 1958 after the first stages by a stomach ache he feared was the onset of appendicitis. After recovering, he was nonetheless the only rider to stay in Gaul's wheel in the Alps and win two stages.Before taking the start in Mulhouse at the end of June 1959, Bahamontes, 31, made a vow: he was aiming for yellow, and nothing else. He and Gaul, the two best climbers of their generation, respected each other, even if the Spaniard considered the Luxembourger ""a funny guy who watched couples at the hotel through the keyhole"". Gaul fell behind in the overall standings of the 1959 Tour, but proved a valuable breakaway companion on the 17th stage between Saint-Etienne and Grenoble. Gaul won the stage, Bahamontes took the yellow jersey.In the days that followed, Bahamontes faltered under the threat of Henri Anglade. Fortunately for the Spaniard, the French big shots, Anquetil, Rivière and Bobet, preferred to favor a foreigner rather than see a ""little rider"" from the Centre-Midi regional team triumph in their place.In 1963, the Eagle of Toledo was still flying high, but finished second behind an untouchable Anquetil in the final time trial. The following year, he completed his collection with the only missing place on his list of honours: third.After his career, he became the manager of a bicycle and moped store in Toledo, and enjoyed showing visitors around the museum dedicated to him. In 2009, he led Le Monde journalist Jean-Louis Aragon through the streets of his city where, he said, ""they treat me like a king"".Nostalgia had become a faithful friend. In his memories, the sun burned his body, his hands were placed at the top of the handlebars, so he climbed the Aubisque, the Télégraphe or the Izoard again and again, alone in the lead of course. ""I relive those moments every day,"" he confessed. ""I still get such a thrill out of it all, and following today's races, seeing the places I've been, I get goosebumps and I'm happy."" Today, Spain is less so.",/en/obituaries/
'Hélène Carrère d'Encausse is something else',"The historian and member of the Académie Française Pascal Ory writes that the institution's long-standing secretary, who died on August 5, transcended her vocation as a historian by successively taking positions of leadership in the two fields that defined her: European politics and the Académie Française.","Hélène Carrère d'Encausse had just turned 94 but the news of her death surprised all of us at the Académie. We thought that age had no hold on this woman of rare elegance who, only a month ago, with her usual smile and firmness, presided over the year's last plenary session at the Académie.A few years ago, when the new perpetual secretary of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, elected for a non-renewable six-year term, came to pay Hélène a courtesy call, she was quick to remind him that, at the Académie Française, one necessarily had a deep understanding of linguistic meaning and that she would take the word ""perpetual"" literally.In the face of such exemplary rigor, we can only admire the life path of the young orphan who knew since 1944 – as Georges Perec (1936-1982), taught us – that history has to be written ""with a big ax."" She had been a young naturalized citizen in 1950, in the ideal position to realize that, at that time, one could not save oneself by being ""stateless"" or ""Russian"" or even ""Georgian."" Survival depended on two concepts: scholarship and France.Indeed, the hard-working historian quickly established herself as a leading authority on Russian and Soviet studies, with some 40 books to her credit, including no fewer than 15 published during her tenure as perpetual secretary. And her bibliography remains significant in terms of substance.Carrère d'Encausse's work witnessed the resurgence of political and geopolitical history under the aegis of two great historians at Sciences Po, René Rémond [1918-2007] and Jean-Baptiste Duroselle [1917-1994]. Her work both followed and inspired a vertiginous historiographical evolution. Starting out as a study of the relationship between Marxism and the Russian world, Carrère d'Encausse's investigation would soon focus on the national question, raising troubling questions in Cold War times.The most important and widely acclaimed work is L'Empire Eclaté (""The Shattered Empire""), published 11 years before the fall of the empire in question. There has since been much debate about the relevance of the proposed analysis. It is a strange debate given that the 1978 book's theses were not contradicted by the result of the economic, social and political schisms that arose from the 1980s onward in Poland, Hungary and the Baltic States, and even more so elsewhere in the 1990s. That was indeed the geopolitical outcome.And so from Le Grand Frère (Big Brother: The Soviet Union and Soviet Europe, 1983) and Le Grand Défi (The Great Challenge: Nationalities & the Bolshevik State, 1987) onward, the author became the historian best placed to analyze nationalism at the foot of the Wall, as she did in La Gloire des Nations (""The Glory of Nations""). From then on, her rereading of the imperial period led her to write Catherine II, Alexander II, Nicholas II and other books that could be received with even more attention as she had established a body of work without seeking recognition as a ""prophet.""",/en/obituaries/
"Musician Sixto Rodriguez, subject of 'Searching for Sugarman' documentary, dies at 81","    The musician flopped in the United States, but he became a star in South Africa for songs protesting the Vietnam War, racial inequality, abuse of women and social mores. ","Singer and songwriter Sixto Rodriguez, who was the subject of the Oscar-winning documentary Searching for Sugarman, has died. He was 81.Rodriguez's death on Tuesday, August 8, in Detroit was announced on the Sugarman.org website and confirmed Wednesday by his granddaughter, Amanda Kennedy. He died following a short illness, according to his wife, Konny Rodriguez, 72. A 2013 Associated Press story referred to Rodriguez as ""the greatest protest singer and songwriter that most people never heard of.""His albums flopped in the United States in the 1970s, but – unknown to him – he later became a star in South Africa where his songs protesting the Vietnam War, racial inequality, abuse of women and social mores inspired white liberals horrified by the country's brutal racial segregation system of apartheid. Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul's documentary Searching for Sugar Man presented Rodriguez to a much larger audience. The film tells of two South Africans' mission to seek out the fate of their musical hero. It won the Academy Award for best documentary in 2013.Rodriguez was ""more popular than Elvis"" in South Africa, Stephen ""Sugar"" Segerman said in 2013. The Cape Town record store owner's nickname comes from the Rodriguez song ""Sugarman."" As his popularity in South Africa grew, Rodriguez lived in Detroit. But his fans in South Africa believed he also was famous in the United States. They heard stories that the musician had died dramatically: He'd shot himself in the head onstage in Moscow. He'd set himself aflame and burned to death before an audience someplace else. He'd died of a drug overdose. Or he was locked up in a mental institution or incarcerated for murdering his girlfriend.In 1996, Segerman and journalist Carl Bartholomew-Strydom set out to learn the truth. Their efforts led them to Detroit, where they found Rodriguez working on construction sites. ""It's rock-and-roll history now. Who would-a thought?"" Rodriguez told The Associated Press a decade ago. Rodriguez said he just ""went back to work"" after his music career fizzled, raising a family that includes three daughters and launching several unsuccessful campaigns for public office. He made a living through manual labor in Detroit. Still, he never stopped playing his music.""I felt I was ready for the world, but the world wasn't ready for me,"" Rodriguez said. ""I feel we all have a mission – we have obligations. Those turns on the journey, different twists – life is not linear.""Konny Rodriguez said the couple met in 1972 while both were students at Wayne State University in Detroit and married in the early 1980s. Although still married at the time of his death, the couple had been separated for a number of years, she said Wednesday while shuffling through some of Sixto Rodriguez's memorabilia.""He loved college. He was born to be taught, to teach himself,"" Konny Rodriguez said. ""The music was more to bring people together. He would play anywhere, anytime. That's where I noticed him. He was walking down Cass Avenue with a guitar and a black bag. He was a really eccentric guy.""The two albums she said he recorded in 1969 and 1971 ""didn't do well."" Rodriguez added, ""I'm sure that was still in his head. Then in 1979, I picked up the phone and it was a guy with an Australian accent who said, 'He must come to Australia because he's very famous here.'""She said they toured Australia in 1979 and 1981 and later learned about the impact of his music in South Africa: ""Apartheid was going on. Frank Sinatra had a full-page ad, 'Do not go to South Africa.' We didn't.""After the end of apartheid, Sixto Rodriguez did travel to South Africa and perform in front of his fans there, she said. Sixto Rodriguez later pursued royalties he did not receive from his music being used and played in South Africa. Some of Rodriguez's songs were banned by the apartheid regime and many bootlegged copies were made on tapes and later CDs.",/en/obituaries/
"Sinead O'Connor, singer of despair and revolt, has died","    The Irish musician died on Wednesday at age 56. Known for the global hit 'Nothing Compares 2 U,' released in 1990, she caused a scandal by tearing up a photo of Pope John Paul II live on television. ","Irish singer Sinead O'Connor passed away at the age of 56 on Wednesday, July 26. With her repeated outbursts, she held an incomparable place in the music scene, from which she twice announced her retirement before changing her mind in 2003 and again in 2021. She was best known for her version of ""Nothing Compares 2 U,"" a song composed by Prince that became the biggest hit of 1990. According to the Dublin daily The Irish Times, neither the place nor the circumstances of her death were specified in a statement from her family, who have requested ""privacy at this very difficult time.""Since the suicide of her 17-year-old son in January 2022, O'Connor's life had been nothing but misery. Having tweeted that she no longer wanted to live, she was hospitalized at her own request. The tragedy put an end to a planned tour and postponed indefinitely the release of her 11th studio album, No Veteran Dies Alone.O'Connor, whose frankness was as disarming as it was uncomfortable, seemed inseparable from pain, even in her peak years. The video for ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" introduced the world to her beautiful green eyes; her short, shaved hair; and her powerful, heart-wrenching voice. There is a still shot of her walking alone in Parc de Saint-Cloud, near Paris. As French poet Alfred de Musset wrote, ""The most despairing songs are the most beautiful,"" and this one is a pure tear-jerker, which she lets flow in the last verse. Her love has left her, and ""all flowers in the backyard that you planted, mama, all died when you went away."" This sentence was addressed to her mother, who had died five years earlier in a car accident.Prince wrote this lachrymose ballad for his side project, The Family. She seemed to be the only one to notice it in 1985. With this single, O'Connor ensured the success of her second album, the 7-million-unit-selling I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, in which, as playful as ever, she covered a translation of a 17th-century Irish poem, ""I Am Stretched on Your Grave."" The song is sung over the top of a rhythmic loop based on James Brown's ""Funky Drummer,"" which is probably the most sampled track in history. Having become a star, she would now work hard to break free of this new status.O'Connor was born in Dublin on December 8, 1966, to parents she claims abused her as a child. She was sent to a Magdalene laundry for her truancy and kleptomania at the age of 15. This sinister Irish institution was designed to put ""lost girls"" back on the straight and narrow. She found the experience horrifying.",/en/obituaries/
"Robbie Robertson, iconic songwriter and guitarist of The Band, dies at 80","    From collaborating with Bob Dylan to crafting timeless rock classics, the Canadian-born musician helped reshape American music. ","Robbie Robertson, guitarist and main songwriter of the seminal rock group The Band, has died, the trade publication Variety said Wednesday, August 9, citing his manager. He was 80 years old.As the ringleader of the Canadian-American group, Robertson penned The Band's most iconic songs including ""The Weight,"" ""The Night They Drove Ol' Dixie Down"" and ""Up On Cripple Creek.""His manager said he was surrounded by family at the time of his death, without citing a cause.Prior to his work and leadership with The Band, Robertson was a key collaborator with none other than Bob Dylan, touring with him and playing on the album ""Blonde on Blonde.""Born July 5, 1943, in Toronto, Canada to a Native American mother, Robertson worked on traveling carnivals in his early teenage years, before joining, and starting, a variety of bands. ""I've been playing guitar for so long I can't remember when I started,"" he told Rolling Stone magazine in 1968. ""I guess I got into rock and roll like everybody else.""He joined the backing band of Ronnie Hawkins, a rockabilly star, when he was just 16, where he eventually met fellow musicians Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Levon Helm.The group formed a strong bond, and they became Dylan's backing band in the mid-1960s for his infamous first electric tour. They also played with the icon on his much-bootlegged ""basement tapes.""After several name changes, the musicians became known as The Band. Robertson's history-minded compositions were masterful yarns that evoked the wilds of America and the characters who colored them, and in particular, focused on the American South.""The Weight"" is a regular on all-time greatest songs lists – a folk tune with country and gospel elements as well as Biblical allusion, it's considered a classic of the American songbook. The group played Woodstock and cut a string of albums including ""Music from Big Pink,"" ""The Band"" and ""Cahoots.""The Band split up in 1976 with a farewell concert in San Francisco, immortalized on film by director Martin Scorsese in ""The Last Waltz."" The film, theatrically released in 1978, has become known as a critically acclaimed pioneering rock documentary.It also ushered in Robertson's longtime collaboration and friendship with Scorsese, who hired the guitarist as a musical supervisor on a string of his films including ""Casino"" and ""Gangs of New York.""Robertson didn't tour again after ""The Last Waltz"" but did release a string of solo albums starting in 1987, when he dropped ""Robbie Robertson."" He remained a beloved figure of American rock and folk, both for his guitar chops and his poetry.""I thought of a couple of words that led to a couple more,"" he told Rolling Stone in 1969, asked how he penned the classic ""The Weight."" ""The next thing I know I wrote the song,"" Robertson continued. ""We just figured it was a simple song, and when it came up we gave it a try and recorded it three or four times."" ""We didn't even know if we were going to use it.""",/en/obituaries/
"Robbie Robertson, founder of 'The Band' and road companion of Bob Dylan","    With his band, the guitarist crafted albums that left a significant impact on his peers during the 1960s, eventually forging an unbreakable connection with Martin Scorsese. ","On the big screen, he was the star of The Last Waltz (1978), Martin Scorsese's documentary on The Band's false farewell, often cited as the finest rock concert ever filmed. And before that, the principal composer of a neo-traditionalist quintet of American music, a fellow traveler with Bob Dylan, whose first two albums exerted a major influence on his contemporaries in the late 1960s. Canadian guitarist Robbie Robertson died on Wednesday, August 9, in Los Angeles at the age of 80. His family has asked those wishing to express their grief to make donations to the Six Nations Indian Reserve in Grand River, Ontario, for the construction of a cultural center. It was here that Robertson, of Iroquois descent through his mother, learned to play the guitar from family members.Born in Toronto on July 5, 1943, Jaime Royal Robertson was hooked on rhythm'n'blues and its extension, rock'n'roll, as a pre-teen. At the age of 16, he was spotted by Ronnie Hawkins, a US singer from Arkansas with a career in Ontario. His group, The Hawks, would gradually bring together future members of The Band: drummer Levon Helm (also from Arkansas) and three other Canadians, bassist Rick Danko, pianist Richard Manuel and organist Garth Hudson, now the last surviving member.From 1964 onwards, the five musicians became independent under the name Levon and the Hawks and were then recruited by Bob Dylan for a tour of the United States beginning in the autumn of 1965. The second half of the concerts, electric (literally and figuratively), provoked a wrath amongst folk fans, who saw it as a betrayal of their idol. The hostility from of some of the public was even more vociferous in the UK, when the band was without Helm, who had decided to throw in the towel. The episode toughened them up, but they were happy to see the back of it in May 1966. In July, Dylan suffered a mysterious motorcycle accident and retired from the stage for almost eight years. He made his comeback with The Band in 1974, on a triumphant North American tour.Robertson, who took part in the recording of the master's masterpiece Blonde on Blonde, reunited with Dylan and his bandmates in 1967 in the Catskill Mountains, New York. The star took a break in the country at Woodstock. Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson rented a house in the vicinity nicknamed ""Big Pink."" Every day, they gathered there to record music using rudimentary technology. The result was a hundred or so songs, creations, traditional songs, folk, blues and country classics. Helm, who was working on oil rigs in New Orleans, rejoined the group. These recordings, which generated huge sums of money on the pirate market, were officially released in 1975 under the title The Basement Tapes.",/en/obituaries/
"Sixto Rodriguez, enigmatic singer-songwriter, has died","    Brought out of relative obscurity in 2012 by the documentary 'Searching for Sugar Man', the American singer-songwriter passed away at 81 years old. ","After a short musical career out of the spotlight from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, the documentary film Searching for Sugar Man, by Swedish director Malik Bendjelloul (1977-2014) brought him into the spotlight. The film was presented at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2012. Singer, guitarist and songwriter Sixto Rodriguez died on Tuesday, August 8, at the age of 81. His website Sugarman.org announced his death without any further details.By the time the film started being shown at film festivals and receiving several awards including the Oscar for Best Documentary Film, Rodriguez had already been rediscovered by a core group of fans. This was thanks to the careful re-release of his two albums Cold Fact (1970) and Coming From Reality (1971) by the American record company Light in the Attic Records in 2008 and 2009. He was the subject of a number of articles and gave a few concerts in the USA. In France, he performed at the pioneering Transmusicales de Rennes festival in December 2009. We have a slightly distant personal memory of the performance that left us a little skeptical.Born on July 10, 1942, in Detroit, Michigan, Sixto Diaz Rodriguez was raised in a working-class environment. His father arrived from Mexico in the 1920s to work in the city’s car factories and his mother was Native American. She died when Rodriguez was 3. He learned a few guitar chords, started singing around the age of 20, and survived by doing odd jobs. Vision problems forced him to wear dark glasses at an early age. In 1967, he recorded his first 45-rpm single, a little folk with an organ background.He continued to play in clubs, and in the summer of 1969 recorded a dozen songs in the studio. These songs would be on his first album, Cold Fact, released in March 1970 by the Sussex record company. The album’s sleeve shows only his last name, Rodriguez. The album begins with the song Sugar Man, probably his best-known song today. He has a soft voice with a slight drawl and a nasal quality reminiscent of Bob Dylan. He has an expressive energy too, at times, like Richie Havens (one of the heroes of Woodstock with his interpretation of Freedom). There are some slightly psychedelic arrangements in places, strings and wind instruments, with Mike Theodore and Dennis Coffey as producers, who regularly work for the soul label Motown Records.The album went unnoticed. As did the next one, Coming From Reality, recorded in London at the end of 1970 and released in November 1971, still under Rodriguez’s name and on the Sussex label. A little more folk, with a touch of rock and string. It includes a dreamy, slightly pop ballad, To Whom It May Concern, which had all the makings of a hit. But it wasn’t.",/en/obituaries/

He was 92. ","Clarence Avant, the judicious manager, entrepreneur, facilitator and adviser who helped launch or guide the careers of Quincy Jones, Bill Withers and many others and came to be known as the ""Black Godfather"" of music and beyond, has died. He was 92.Avant, inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, died on Sunday, August 14, at his home in Los Angeles, according to a family statement released Monday.""Clarence leaves behind a loving family and a sea of friends and associates that have changed the world and will continue to change the world for generations to come. The joy of his legacy eases the sorrow of our loss,"" said the statement, which was released by Avant's son Alex, daughter Nicole and her husband, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos.Avant’s achievements were both public and behind the scenes, as a name in the credits, or a name behind the names. Born in a segregated hospital in North Carolina, he became a man of lasting and wide-ranging influence, in part by minding two pieces of advice from an early mentor, the music manager Joe Glaser: Never let on how much you know, and ask for as much money as possible, ""without stuttering.""Born in 1931, Clarence Avant spent his early years in Greensboro, North Carolina, one of eight children raised by a single mother, and he dropped out of high school to move north. A friend from North Carolina helped him find work managing a lounge in Newark, New Jersey, and he soon got to know Glaser, whose clients ranged from Louis Armstrong to Barbra Streisand, not to mention Al Capone. Through Glaser, Avant found himself in places where Black people rarely had been permitted.As he rose in the entertainment industry, Avant became more active politically. He was an early supporter of Tom Bradley, the first Black mayor of Los Angeles, and served as executive producer of Save the Children, a 1973 documentary about a concert fundraiser for the Reverend Jesse Jackson’s Operation PUSH. Three years earlier, when he learned that the civil rights leader Andrew Young was running for Congress, in Georgia, he gave him a call.Sometimes called ""The Godfather of Black Music,"" he broke in as a manager in the 1950s, with such clients as singers Sarah Vaughan and Little Willie John and composer Lalo Schifrin, who wrote the theme to Mission: Impossible. In the 1970s he was an early patron of Black-owned radio stations and, in the 1990s, headed Motown after founder Berry Gordy Jr. sold the company.He also started such labels as Sussex (a hybrid of two Avant passions – success and sex) and Tabu, with artists including Withers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the SOS Band and an obscure singer-songwriter, Sixto Rodriquez, who decades later became famous through the Oscar-winning documentary Searching for Sugarman.Other work took place more quietly. Avant brokered the sale of Stax Records to Gulf and Western in 1968, after being recruited by Stax executive Al Bell as a bridge between the entertainment and business industries. He raised money for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, helped Michael Jackson organize his first solo tour and advised Narada Michael Walden, LA Reid and Babyface and other younger admirers.""Everyone in this business has been by Clarence’s desk, if they’re smart,"" Quincy Jones liked to say of him.Avant’s influence extended to sports. He helped running back Jim Brown transition from football to acting and produced a primetime television special for Muhammad Ali. When baseball great Henry Aaron was on the verge of surpassing Babe Ruth as the game’s home run champion, in 1974, Avant made sure that Aaron received the kind of lucrative commercial deals often elusive for Black athletes, starting with a personal demand to the president of Coca-Cola. Aaron would later tell The Undefeated that everything he had become was ""because of Clarence Avant.""Avant met Jacqueline Gray, a model at the time, at an Ebony Fashion Fair in mid-1960s and married her in 1967. They had two children: Music producer-manager Alexander Devore and Nicole Avant, the former US ambassador to the Bahamas and, along with Sarandos, a major fundraiser for Obama. Besides his Rock Hall induction, his honors included two honorary Grammys, an NAACP Image Award and a BET entrepreneur award.",/en/obituaries/
"Pierre Alferi, a singular writer, has died","    The writer and poet, who was the eldest son of philosopher Jacques Derrida, and authored a wide range of works including collections, novels and essays, died in Paris on August 16, aged 60. ","The news of Pierre Alferi's death in Paris on Wednesday, August 16, at the age of 60, immediately triggered the intense, almost selfish sadness of losing a marvelous writer. He was a wonderfully idiosyncratic and surprisingly multi-faceted author, whose books, like his many other works, were a regular and somewhat mischievous addition to a body of work that was always in motion – vibrant to the extreme, at the crossroads of poetry, the novel, cinema, music, philosophy, the visual arts and even, one might say, science and technology.Now sealed by death, this work nevertheless remains open, available for future readings, of which there will certainly be many. It is the product of a philosopher by training, himself the child of a philosopher, Alferi being the eldest son of Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) and psychoanalyst and translator Marguerite Aucouturier (1932-2020). He studied at the École Normale Supérieure on rue d'Ulm, passed the agrégation, which is the French civil service exam, and then, under the supervision of Louis Marin, wrote a thesis on the medieval thinker and theologian William of Ockham (c. 1285-1349), which he would shortly publish as his first book, Guillaume d'Ockham le singulier (Minuit, 1989).Discreet about his ancestry, adopting his maternal grandmother's name for public life, Alferi was no less loyal to a certain spirit of Derrida, to whom he pays a discreet tribute in his last published book, Divers chaos (P.O.L, 2020): ""I haven't forgotten my father's postcard"" (allusion to Jacques Derrida's famous book, The Post Card. From Socrates to Freud and Beyond, Aubier-Flammarion, 1980). He has the same philosophical curiosity, a manifest taste for speculative play and a rigorous attention to objects that may turn out to be unexpected, as well as a formidable flair for titles: Kub Or; Fmn; Sentimentale journée; Après vous; Kiwi (1994; 1994; 1997; 2010; 2012, all published by P.O.L), or Le Cinéma des familles, a novel that joyfully reinvents the autobiographical genre by imagining a child's filmed account, from an early age, of ""Mompère"" and ""Mammère"" (P.O.L, 1999).Initially a poet, who published a number of collections and essays starting in the 1990s, Alferi soon showed a penchant for collaborative creation and personal friendship. He collaborated (under the name Thomas Lago) with musician and Kat Onoma singer Rodolphe Burger, who remained one of his favorite accomplices, from the creation in the early 2000s of Cinépoèmes et films parlants, until their revival on various French stages last spring. He worked with sculptor Jacques Julien, wrote an album with Jeanne Balibar (Paramour, 2003), participated in the creation of shows with choreographer Fanny de Chaillé, hosted the magazine Détail with photographer Suzanne Doppelt, and in 1995 and 1996, together with Olivier Cadiot, edited the two issues of a publication that it would be no exaggeration to describe as historic: the Revue de littérature générale, which can be read as a summary of poetic creation for the transition to the next century. He was also a translator (of John Donne, Giorgio Agamben, John Ashbery...) and a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris.",/en/obituaries/
"Jean-Louis Georgelin, general in charge of rebuilding Notre-Dame de Paris, has died","    The former army chief of staff died while hiking in the mountains, a year before the end of the mission entrusted to him by Emmanuel Macron. He was 74 years old. ","The last time we see Jean-Louis Georgelin, he was spiritedly climbing the stairs to the construction platform behind Notre-Dame de Paris. Georgelin was speaking loudly, as was his custom – shouting would probably be the right word – with a smile dancing on his lips. ""You saw the flying buttress there, ah yes... The hardest thing about this type of project is managing the schedule.""Ever since French President Emmanuel Macron entrusted him with the mission – in the aftermath of the fire that took place on April 15, 2019 – the reconstruction of the cathedral had been his prime focus. The shaky edifice now rested on his shoulders, as the retired Chief of Staff of the French Armed Forces, with his reputation as a braggart, a man suspicious of technocracy but entirely at ease in its mysteries. ""Isn't this mess beautiful?"" he asked. ""Yes, it's beautiful,"" we answered, and this became our last image of him, avidly watching the scaffolding of the spire being put into place.On Friday, August 18, in Ariège, on the slopes of Mont Valier, Genera Georgelin died as he lived, walking fast and strong during one of the solitary hikes he was still fond of at the age of 74 in the Pyrénées. ""Investigations have established that his death was the result of a major fall during the descent, at around 8 pm, on a particularly steep rocky passage"", the prosecutor's office said on Saturday evening.Aspet, in the former Comminges region, is just over an hour's drive away, this is where the general, a practicing Catholic, was born on August 30, 1948. His maternal grandparents ran a grocery store in the village of 800 inhabitants. His father was a soldier in Indochina and Algeria. During the period of the war in Indochina, his mother lived ""secluded"" here with her three children. His father ended up as a captain.Their son studied at École Spéciale Militaire Saint-Cyr, with a focus on science, while in Paris others were building barricades, before choosing the infantry. ""I'm an infantryman. Walking makes you think,"" he insisted the first time we met him, to illustrate the fact that he went to the Notre-Dame construction site on foot. For the son of a lower ranking officer to become a five-star general is rare enough to merit a mention. Within the army, Georgelin was a child of social climbing – to the highest level.After working as Jacques Chirac's private chief of staff at the Elysée Palace, he served as Army chief of staff until 2010, before becoming Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honor. In this role, he rubbed shoulders with François Hollande. He also became embroiled in a controversy with Aurélie Filippetti when he first refused to award the Légion d'honneur to Bob Dylan, before relenting. ""As a result, I studied him a lot,"" he remembered, amused. ""I discovered his extraordinary popularity, and that he was shortlisted for the Nobel Prize for literature."" Then there's Nicolas Sarkozy, who is said to have just criticized him for singing too loudly at mass. ""People aren't aware of their own voice,"" he apologized. ""But yes, it's true, I love singing in church.""",/en/obituaries/
"Ron Cephas-Jones, 'This Is Us' actor, dead at 66",    Jones had a double lung transplant in 2020 because of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and spent nearly two months in a Los Angeles hospital. ,"Ron Cephas Jones, a veteran stage actor who won two Emmy Awards for his role as a long-lost father who finds redemption on the NBC television drama series This Is Us, has died at age 66, a representative said on Saturday, August 19. Jones' manager, Dan Spilo, said in an emailed statement the actor died ""due to a long-standing pulmonary issue."" ""Throughout the course of his career, his warmth, beauty, generosity, kindness and heart were felt by anyone who had the good fortune of knowing him,"" Spilo said.On This Is Us, Jones played William ""Shakespeare"" Hill, a biological father whose life is renewed through his relationship with the family of his son Randall Pearson, played by Sterling K. Brown. ""One of the most wonderful people the world has ever seen is no longer with us,"" Brown said in an Instagram post after Jones' death. ""The world is a little less bright. Brother, you are loved. And you will be missed.""Jones won Emmys for best guest actor in a drama series in 2018 and 2020 and was nominated for two more.""Ron was the best of the best – on-screen, on stage, and in real life,"" This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman said on X (the social media site formerly known as Twitter). ""My God: What an actor. I don’t think I ever changed a single take of his in a cut because everything he did was perfect.""Jones spent most of his career in the theater before and after This Is Us, returning to Broadway even after his transplant forced him to learn to breathe and walk again. ""My whole life has been the stage,"" Jones said in a late 2021 interview with the The New York Times , in which he revealed he had quietly been suffering from respiratory problems since about the time he began on This Is Us. ""The idea of not performing again seemed worse to me than death,"" Jones said.He was nominated for a Tony Award and won a 2022 Drama Desk Award for the Broadway role of a truck-stop cook in playwright Lynn Nottage's Clyde's.A native of Paterson, New Jersey, Jones graduated from nearby Ramapo College, where he had intended to study jazz but switched to theater during his sophomore year. He spent the late 1970s and early 1980s traveling the country, working as a bus driver in Southern California for several years.In the mid-1980s he moved to New York, where his career got a jumpstart when he began hanging out and collaborating at the Nuyorican Poets Café, a vital creative hub for poetry, hip-hop, and the performing arts. He would spend the ensuing decades constantly in the theater, often in Off-Broadway plays in New York, including a title turn as Shakespeare's ""Richard III"" at The Public Theater, and in roles with the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago.Jones also had TV guest stints on Mr. Robot, Luke Cage and Lisey's Story.

French economist and exceptional professor Daniel Cohen dies,"    One of France's most respected and instructive economists passed away on Sunday at the age of 70. A professor at the École Normale Supérieur, he revealed the relevance of the field to everyday life. ","Daniel Cohen was able to discuss Roger Federer's tennis career, Africa's debt crisis and the future of our prosperous yet unhappy civilization with equal passion and brilliance. France's great contemporary intellectual passed away of a blood disease on Sunday, August 20 at the age of 70 at the Necker Hospital in Paris. He leaves behind an exceptional generation of students, including a Nobel Prize winner, as well as a prolific body of thought contained in more than 15 books.Cohen was one of France's most respected economists, famous among the general public for his books that were both educational and enlightening. ""Daniel Cohen was a teacher, a man of ideals and pedagogy, a man of debate and commitment. We lose a great intellectual, an economist who made French research shine, a sincere humanist,"" wrote French President Emmanuel Macron on X (formerly Twitter).Born on June 16, 1953 in Tunis, Cohen spent his childhood in Paris, pampered by his mother, a pharmacist, and his father, a doctor. He was 15 at the time of the May 68 student revolts, his first political awakening. He excelled at math and his father hoped to see him attend France's elite engineering university, École Polytechnique, in Paris. He passed the entrance exam, but chose instead the École Normale Supérieure, achieving the prestigious agrégation teaching certification in mathematics in 1976. Despite his focus on math, the oil crisis of 1973, which signaled the end of the post-war boom, intrigued him enough for him to focus on the analysis of this fundamental shift, which would result in inflation, unemployment and deindustrialization a few years later. It was the end of one era in global economics and the beginning of another.""We shared the same passion for the novels of Kundera, García Márquez and Vargas Llosa, where politics and literature intertwined,"" said historian and philosopher Michel Marian, whom he befriended at the École Normale. At the time, economics courses turned their attention to the slow decomposition of Marxism. The gifted mathematician never neglected the study of politics, culture and economics as necessary dimensions to understand and explain the world.The French introduction to his first book for the general public, The Misfortunes of Prosperity (1994), opens with an analogy between the disappearance of growth and that of Mademoiselle Albertine, who causes Proust much suffering in his In Search of Lost Time. ""But growth didn't return, and a disappointed economic policy ended up declaring its own futility, blaming unfaithful growth for its own misfortunes"": From the early 1990s, Cohen diagnosed the changing world in a style that was also highly literary.",/en/obituaries/
"Italian pop singer Toto Cutugno, an inspiration for French hits, dies","    The singer and composer of over 300 melodies enjoyed huge success in the 1970s and 1980s, notably with 'L’Italiano' in 1983. In France, his tunes were used for 'L’Été Indien,' 'Laissez-moi Danser' and 'Méditerranéenne.' ","The song L’Italiano begins with ""Lasciatemi cantare/Con la chitarra ai mano"" (""Let me sing/With the guitar in my hands""). First comes the slightly husky voice of its singer and songwriter Toto Cutugno, then an acoustic guitar, violins and a mandolin as a counterpoint. The composer of over 300 melodies for himself and others, including his fellow Italians Ornella Vanoni and Adriano Celentano and several French pop stars, Cutugno will be publicly famous for the 1983 hit L’Italiano (lyrics by Cristiano Minellono). Salvatore Cutugno, known as Toto Cutugno, died on Tuesday, August 22, in Milan, aged 80. His manager broke the news in the late afternoon, saying that ""the singer’s condition had worsened in recent months following a long illness.""Born on July 7, 1943, in Fosdinovo, Tuscany, the second of three children, Cutugno grew up in La Spezia, Liguria. His father, a Sicilian naval non-commissioned officer, was a trumpeter in the municipal brass band. In an interview with Le Monde in 2018, Toto Cutugno summed up his introduction to music in just a few words: ""My father (...) took me to a rehearsal when I was eight, and the conductor asked him if I could play the marching drum. From the drum, I moved on to the drum kit, then the accordion and the piano.""He played the drums in his first two bands, Ghigo e i Goghi, about which little is known today, and Toto e i Tati, founded in 1965. Toto e i Tati recorded a handful of 7-inch records up to the end of the 1960s, and scored a minor hit in Italy with La Ragazza Della Spiaggia, a whimsical pop song with choirs, an organ and violins. His next group, Albatros, founded in 1974 with the help of lyricist and producer Vito Pallavicini, offered a little more substance.Cutugno was the lead singer, recording several singles and an album until 1978. Some of the group’s songs were adapted into French, the most well-known among them being Africa, the story of a Black American singer who encourages a return to Africa, sung in English by Cutugno. In 1975 the song was adapted as L’Été Indien for French singer-songwriter Joe Dassin by lyricists Claude Lemesle and Pierre Delanoë. In 1976, Dassin also sang Monja Monja which became Il Était Une Fois Nous Deux while Nel Cuore Nei Sensi became Voici Les Clefs for singer-songwriter Gérard Lenorman.At the end of the 1970s, Toto Cutugno collaborated with French music stars. He wrote En Chantant for singer Michel Sardou in 1976, even as he rose to major fame in Italy with his second solo album, Voglio l’Anima; of which the eponymous track was adapted for singer and actress Dalida in 1979 under the title Laissez-moi Danser. In the early 1980s, he released Solo Noi (1980), whose title track won him a prize at the San Remo Festival – in which he participated over a dozen times with such hits as Innamorata, Innamorato, Innamorati (1981), La Mia Musica (1982) and, perhaps most famously, the L’Italiano album in 1983.",/en/obituaries/
Popular game show host Bob Barker has died,    Barker was a household name for a half-century as host of 'Truth or Consequences' and 'The Price Is Right'. ,"Popular game show host Bob Barker, a household name for a half-century as host of ""Truth or Consequences"" and ""The Price Is Right,"" has died at his home in Los Angeles. Barker was 99. He died Saturday, August 26, according to publicist Roger Neal.Barker retired in June 2007, telling his studio audience: ""I thank you, thank you, thank you for inviting me into your home for more than 50 years."" Barker was working in radio in 1956 when producer Ralph Edwards invited him to audition as the new host of ""Truth or Consequences,"" a game show in which audience members had to do wacky stunts – the ""consequence"" – if they failed to answer a question – the ""truth,"" which was always the silly punchline to a riddle no one was ever meant to furnish.In a 1996 interview with The Associated Press, Barker recalled receiving the news that he had been hired: ""I know exactly where I was, I know exactly how I felt: I hung up the phone and said to my wife, 'Dorothy Jo, I got it!'"" Barker stayed with ""Truth or Consequences"" for 18 years – including several years in a syndicated version.Meanwhile, he began hosting a resurrected version of ""The Price Is Right"" in 1972. It would become TV's longest-running game show and the last on a broadcast network of what in TV's early days had numbered dozens. ""I have grown old in your service,"" the silver-haired, perennially tanned Barker joked on a prime-time television retrospective in the mid-'90s. In all, he taped more than 5,000 shows in his career.Born in Darrington, Washington, in 1923, Barker spent part of his childhood on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where his widowed mother had taken a teaching job. The family later moved to Springfield, Mo., where he attended high school. He served in the Navy in World War II.He married Dorothy Jo Gideon, his high school sweetheart; she died in 1981 after 37 years of marriage.

"Mohamed Al-Fayed, Egyptian billionaire tycoon, has died at 94","    The enigmatic billionaire, whose eldest son died in a car crash with Princess Diana, was known for his iconic business ventures and his strained relationship with the British establishment. ","Few things were beyond the reach of billionaire Egyptian tycoon Mohamed Al-Fayed who has died at the age of 94. Hotels, yachts and a football club were bought with ease but he never acquired the recognition he craved.His son Dodi's fateful relationship with princess Diana might have been the moment Fayed finally gained acceptance by the British ""Establishment"" elite. Instead it marked his permanent estrangement after he insisted – without evidence – that Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip had ordered the Paris car crash in which Diana and Dodi were killed to prevent her from marrying a Muslim.Fayed lived most of his life in Britain, where for decades he was never far from the headlines. But to his frustration, he was never granted UK citizenship nor admitted into the upper echelons of British society.Fayed will be remembered most for his outspoken and often foul-mouthed manner, his revenge on the Conservative party, his controversial purchase of the Harrods department store, and his ownership of Fulham football club and the Ritz hotel in Paris.With a business empire encompassing shipping, property, banking, oil, retail and construction, Fayed was also a philanthropist, whose foundation helped children in the UK, Thailand and Mongolia.His gift for self-invention – he added the ""Al-"" prefix to his surname and a 1988 UK government report described his claims of wealthy ancestry as ""completely bogus"" – led segments of the British press to dub him the ""Phoney Pharoah.""Far from being the scion of a dynasty of cotton and shipping barons, he made himself out to be, Fayed was the son of a poor Alexandrian schoolteacher who, after an early venture flogging lemonade, set out in business selling sewing machines. He later had the good luck to start working for the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, who recognized his business abilities and employed him in his furniture export business in Saudi Arabia.He became an advisor to the Sultan of Brunei in the mid-1960s and moved to Britain in the 1970s. Fayed bought the Ritz in 1979 with his brother and the pair snapped up Harrods six years later after a long and bitter takeover battle with British businessman Roland ""Tiny"" Rowland.A subsequent government investigation into the takeover, officially published in 1990, found that Fayed and his brother had been dishonest about their wealth and origins to secure the takeover. They called the claims unfair. Five years later, his first application for British citizenship was rejected.Revenge followed swiftly. Soon after, Fayed told the press that he had paid Conservative MPs to ask questions in parliament on his behalf. This brought down two prominent politicians, while Fayed also exposed Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken's involvement in a Saudi arms deal. Aitken was later jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice.The defining tragedy of Fayed's life came in August 1997: Dodi and Princess Diana died when a car driven by one of Fayed's employees, chauffeur Henri Paul, crashed in a Paris road tunnel. For years afterward, Fayed refused to accept the deaths were the result of speeding and intoxication by Paul, who also died.The distraught Fayed accused the royal family of being behind the deaths and commissioned two memorials to the couple at Harrods. One, unveiled in 1998, was a kitsch pyramid-shaped display with photos of Diana and Dodi, a wine glass purported to be from their final dinner and a ring that he claimed his son bought for the princess. The other, a copper statue of the couple releasing an albatross, was entitled ""Innocent Victims"" – a reflection of his view that Dodi and Diana ""were murdered"".Fayed's claims against the royal family came at a price. Harrods lost a royal warrant bestowed by Prince Philip in 2000 after what Buckingham Palace called ""a significant decline in the trading relationship"" between the prince and the store.Later that year, Fayed ordered the removal of all remaining royal warrants – effectively a regal seal of approval – for supplying the queen, queen mother and Prince Charles, the now King Charles III. The Establishment ""dislike my outspokenness and determination to get the truth"", he said, as he announced his exile to Switzerland in 2003 because of his claims and what he said was the ""unfair"" treatment at the hands of the tax authorities.Fayed sold Harrods in 2010 to the investment arm of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund for a reported £1.5 billion ($2.2 billion), although it was once reported he wanted to remain there even in death. He told the Financial Times in 2002 that he wanted his body to be put on display in a glass mausoleum on Harrods roof ""so people can come and visit me"". Despite his paranoia, secrecy and eccentricities, Fayed's success with the prestige department store was undeniable. Within a decade of his taking over, sales increased by 50% and profits rose from £16 million to £62 million.Other successes included at Fulham, which he transformed from a struggling outfit into a top-flight side. But even here he was ridiculed and he eventually sold up. He claimed in 2014 they were relegated because a giant statue he had commissioned of Michael Jackson outside the ground was removed. Critics, he said characteristically, ""can go to hell"". According to the Forbes list of the world's billionaires, Fayed was worth $1.9 billion in November 2022.",/en/obituaries/
French secularism: 'The 2004 law banning religious symbols in schools was ambiguous from the outset',"The legislation has not prevented recent debates on abayas in France. This is due to a specific conception of secularism that is at odds with the legal precedent, writes legal expert Anne Fornerod.","Despite a memorandum from the French Education Ministry dated November 9, 2022, the wearing of the abaya in public schools continues to cause controversy and has led to the creation of a new text.While delivering on the promise of the ban announced by Education Minister Gabriel Attal, the August 31 memorandum unsurprisingly consists of a reminder of the exisiting legislation (a memorandum cannot add to an existing law). This is the March 15, 2004 law that applies the principle of secularism to the wearing of symbols or clothing expressing a religious affiliation in public schools.In addition to providing an exceptionally strict framework for the wearing of religious symbols by students, the law's explanatory memorandum stated that its aim is ""to enable teachers and school heads to carry out their duties with peace of mind, by establishing a clear rule."" Today, however, it is ""the growing popularity of abaya or khamis-type clothing [that] has given rise to a large number of questions as to what should be done.""How can these questions be explained when the 2004 law seems clear and the applicable law, inevitably case-by-case, has been regularly clarified ever since? There are two possible explanations for this persistent need for further directives: The 2004 law was ambiguous from the outset, and it enshrined a specific conception of secularism.Specifically designed for the Islamic head covering but subject to the requirements of its legislative status, the March 15, 2004 law was intended to set a general standard. The law's contortions of terminology to avoid designating the Islamic veil are at the root of a concept that needed clarification before it could be implemented.The May 18, 2004 memorandum introduced a list of symbols and outfits ""the wearing of which leads to immediate recognition of one's religious affiliation"" (Islamic headscarf, kippah, large cross). And, above all, it interprets the law as prohibiting students ""from invoking the religious character"" they attach to a symbol or outfit. Since 2007, the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest administrative court, has interpreted this to mean symbols or clothing ""the wearing of which ostensibly demonstrates a religious affiliation solely due to the student's behavior.""The memorandum therefore opened the floodgates to subjectivity and the possibility of a secular administrative authority itself qualifying a symbol or garment as ""religious."" The memorandum issued on August 31, 2023, echoes the broad formulation of the law and does not choose between religious garments ""by nature"" and what has been qualified as religious clothing ""by intent.""",/en/religions/
'Macron attending the Pope's mass in Marseille is a breach of secularism',"By attending Pope Francis' mass on September 23, Macron would unjustifiably breach the 1905 law on the separation of the church and government, explains historian Jean-Noël Jeanneney.","Emmanuel Macron's presence at the mass that the pontiff will celebrate on Saturday, September 23, at the Stade-Vélodrome in Marseille is ill-advised. Of course, it is absolutely legitimate that he welcomes Francis, outside places of worship, with all the honors due to him as head of state – that is, if the Pope so wishes, which he appears not to. But we're talking about a very different matter: The French Republic, embodied by its president, would be involved in the ritual expression of a religion that is practiced, among others, on French soil. Is Macron courting traditionalists? The price is too high for the nation as a whole.After the 1918 armistice, Paris' Archbishop Cardinal Léon-Adolphe Amette organized a Te Deum (a Christian hymn in Latin) at Notre Dame Cathedral to thank God for the end of the First World War, and invited the representatives of the French government. At the time, the ""Father of Victory"" Georges Clemenceau was head of government and he radically opposed the idea. He only agreed that the president's wife, Henriette Poincaré, attend the service in her personal capacity. Later, Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier, Archbishop of Malines (Belgium), urged Clemenceau in his leading role at the Paris Peace Conference to ""invite a representative of the principal nations of the Allies to preside over an act of religion."" Should the French government attend church ceremonies? Definitely not, Clemenceau replied, explaining that French law absolutely precluded it. The government, tasked with ardently protecting the various religious doctrines and their practice, was not to interfere with any of them.France must reject any positions taken by public authorities that are contrary to the spirit of secularism. Rather, French citizens must demand rigorous application of the principle, otherwise, the Republic may tumble down a slippery slope. Today, many people – among them, President Macron – evoke this or that precedent to justify the president's impending breach of the 1905 law. None of them are valid.When John Paul II came to France in 1996 to celebrate the anniversary of Clovis' baptism (France's first Catholic king), former president Jacques Chirac rightly welcomed him as sovereign of the Vatican. But as soon as the Pope announced that he would be on a ""pastoral visit"" (which is also Francis' current intention if I've understood correctly), the French president was right not to join him at a Catholic celebration but rather to stand before him as the president of a ""republican and secular"" France.",/en/religions/
"Why Pope Francis is coming 'to Marseille, not to France'","    The pope's visit to the melting pot Mediterranean city comes against the backdrop of the migration crisis, a subject close to his heart, while the concerns of French Catholics appear secondary. ","A majestic imperial residence, built on the orders of Napoleon III for Empress Eugénie, the Palais du Pharo offers a breathtaking view of Marseille's port. It is there, in this monument symbolizing the power of the French state in the 19th century, that Pope Francis will conclude his visit to the Mediterranean city with a speech on Saturday, September 23.The country's second-largest city, with an identity inseparable from the waves of immigration that have shaped it, Marseille is the setting of Pope Francis's second trip to France on Friday and Saturday. In 2014, he went to Strasbourg for a visit to the European Parliament, conceived as a meeting with the EU member states, rather than specifically with France.The logic, this time, remains the same. ""I'll go to Marseille, but not to France,"" Pope Francis openly declared on the plane back from the World Youth Days in Lisbon in early August, before adding that he had nothing against France.The head of the Catholic Church has never made any secret of the fact that Europe is not his priority. Focusing on the marginalised, he has made Asia, Africa, and smaller, poorer countries and those at war his major preoccupations. He has visited Canada to acknowledge the suffering of indigenous peoples, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan to call for an end to war, and Mongolia to pay tribute to a minority church.In responding to the invitation to visit this multicultural city by the sea, Pope Francis is, above all, coming to talk about migrants, a subject particularly close to his heart. This theme has marked his 10-year pontificate, which has seen him make trips to Greece in December 2021 and to the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2013, just a few months after his election.""Who is responsible for the blood of these brothers and sisters? No one is. We all answer like this: it's not me, it's probably someone else... We've lost the sense of fraternal responsibility,"" he said then, referring to ""boats that instead of being a path of hope have been a path of death"". These words resonate still today on Lampedusa, which over the past year has become the main gateway for migrants seeking to reach Europe. Since January, almost 130,000 people have arrived in Italy by sea, twice as many as at the same time in 2022, and the island is in crisis.The tragedies are neverending. Whether off Lampedusa in August, or in the Ionian Sea in June, when 79 bodies were recovered, they continue to turn the Mediterranean into ""a graveyard,"" as Francis said in August.",/en/religions/
Unprecedented security for Pope's visit to Marseille,"    The arrival of Pope Francis, coupled with the presence of Emmanuel Macron, will see 5,000 law enforcement officers on duty in the port city, where 100,000 people are expcted to turn out. ","Pope Francis' visit to Marseille, with the added pressure of the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron, represents a complex security challenge for the French authorities, who must ensure the safety of two heads of state without detracting from the celebrations of popular devotion. They will have to manage a kilometre-long public procession, as well as screen 60,000 worshippers at the entrance to the Stade Vélodrome.Frédérique Camilleri, police prefect for the Bouches-du-Rhône region in the south of France in which Marseille sits, has spent nine months working to deliver ""a plan never before seen in the history of Marseille"". Five thousand police officers, supported by 1,000 security guards, will be on duty on Friday, September 22 and Saturday, September 23. Several hundred civil servants who were to be on leave on these days have been called in.The Pope is expected to land at Marseille-Provence airport on Friday at 4:15pm. He will be welcomed by Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne. The Holy Father will be preceded at all the sites he is due to visit by mine clearance teams. First at Notre-Dame de la Garde, then on Saturday at the Palais du Pharo and the Stade Vélodrome.However, a change to the program announced on Wednesday, September 20 in the Vatican’s daily bulletin has upset the planned arrangements. Saturday's meeting with people experiencing economic hardship, as requested by Pope Francis, will be held not at the archbishop's palace, but at the House of the Missionaries of Charity. A highly symbolic choice, as the mission is located in the heart of one of Marseille's poorest areas, at the junction of the Saint-Mauront and Belle-de-Mai districts, historically home to the poorest of immigrants. Security services had to be called in urgently to check the area.Following the example set by Macron when he came to present the Marseille en Grand plan, the police have decided to set up large, sealed perimeters around the event venues, with strict screening at a distance. At the Stade Vélodrome, only those with a ticket for the mass will be able to access the site. On the Prado, where the Popemobile is due to start its journey at 3:30pm on Saturday, access will only be possible from 9:30am.The same arrangements will be in place in the morning around the Palais du Pharo which, given its position at the entrance to the Vieux-Port, will also be under surveillance by the maritime police. Air Force aircraft will be monitoring any air intrusion during the 26 hours of the Pope's visit, and an anti-drone system has also been deployed.",/en/religions/
Pope Francis arrives in Marseille to urge Mediterranean countries to welcome migrants,"    The pope, who prefers to visit small Catholic communities around the world, has made clear that his trip is not to France but specifically Marseille. ","Pope Francis arrived in Marseille on Friday, September 22, for a two-day visit expected to focus on the surge in migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean, bringing a message of tolerance amid bitter debate over how Europe manages asylum seekers.The French port was decked out in the yellow and white colours of the Vatican for the first visit by a pope to France's second-largest city in 500 years, where he will celebrate a stadium mass on Saturday.The desperate conditions that cause many people to leave their homes for a new life, and the risks they take to do so, have been a key theme in the 86-year-old's decade as head of the worldwide Catholic Church. But his visit to the French port city, to take part in a meeting of Mediterranean-area Catholic bishops and young people, puts him at the centre of a political storm.A surge in migrant boats arriving from North Africa on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa last week triggered outrage both in Italy and beyond. The European Union promised more help for Rome while France, amid wrangling over a draft law governing migrant arrivals there, said it would not accept anyone from Lampedusa.Migration ""represents a challenge that is not easy... but which must be faced together"", Francis said at the Vatican on Sunday. ""It is essential for the future of all, which will be prosperous only if it is built on fraternity, putting human dignity and real people, especially those most in need, in first place.""He becomes the first pope in 500 years to visit the city, a gateway for immigrants and also home to some of the poorest neighbourhoods in Europe, many of which are plagued by drug trafficking.Parts of the city were decked out Friday in the yellow and white colours of the Vatican, particularly on the main Avenue du Prado, through which the pope will travel in his popemobile on Saturday. Regional newspaper La Provence welcomed his arrival with the headline ""Habemus papam"", the famous Latin phrase meaning ""We have a pope!"" used on the election of a pontiff.Ahead of what will be his 44th overseas trip, and in increasingly fragile health, Francis admitted this month that papal voyages were not as easy as they used to be. He underwent hernia surgery in June, less than two years after having colon surgery, and routinely uses a wheelchair due to a troublesome knee.The pope was met at the airport by French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne. He will head to the Basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde, a symbolic monument overlooking the city, for a prayer with local clergy on Friday afternoon.That will be followed by a moment of meditation with representatives of other religions in front of a memorial to sailors and migrants lost at sea. The United Nations estimates more than 28,000 migrants who tried to cross the Mediterranean have gone missing since 2014.Tens of thousands of pilgrims are expected for the visit, despite the decline of Catholicism in France.On Saturday afternoon, Francis will lead a mass in the Velodrome stadium, with 57,000 people expected, including French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron's decision to attend has sparked controversy among left-wing politicians in the officially secular country.Some right-wing politicians have meanwhile criticised the pope's stance on migrants – but Marseille mayor Benoit Payan said the pontiff ""has a message to deliver, not advice to give."" ""We have a pope who is particularly courageous and who, in the turmoil of the world, in the crises we are currently facing, has a universal message... of peace,"" he told Agence France-Presse (AFP).",/en/religions/
"Pope Francis urges Europe to save migrants at sea, warning against 'fanaticism of indifference'","    During the start of his visit to Marseille, the Catholic leader singled out 'the disinterest that, with velvet gloves, condemns others to death' while speaking at a memorial dedicated to sailors and migrants lost at sea. ","Pope Francis on Friday, September 22, said European governments had a duty to rescue asylum-seekers who take to sea to escape conflict, warning against a ""paralysis of fear"" as he entered the growing political controversy on the first day of a visit to the French Mediterranean city of Marseille.Marseille was decked out in the yellow and white colors of the Vatican for the first visit by a pope to France's second-largest city in 500 years, where 100,000 people are expected to turn out to greet the pontiff in his ""popemobile"" on Saturday.The 86-year-old is visiting to take part in a meeting of Mediterranean-area Catholic bishops and young people – but his trip comes at a politically sensitive time. As European nations have sought to shift responsibility for taking care of people arriving by sea, the pope singled out ""the disinterest that, with velvet gloves, condemns others to death.""""People who are at risk of drowning when abandoned on the waves must be rescued,"" he said from the hilltop Basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde overlooking the glistening Mediterranean waters. In remarks dedicated to migrants lost at sea, he said, ""It is a duty of humanity, it is a duty of civilization"" to save people in difficulty, warning governments against the ""fanaticism of indifference"" and ""paralysis of fear.""A surge in migrant boats arriving from North Africa on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa last week triggered outrage in Italy and a heated debate across Europe over how to share responsibility for the influx. The desperate conditions that cause many people to leave their homes for a new life, and the risks they take to do so, have been a key theme during Francis' decade as head of the Catholic Church.In unprepared remarks added at the end of his speech, the pope thanked NGOs rescuing migrants in danger at sea and condemned efforts to prevent their activity as ""gestures of hate."" The pontiff had disembarked from his plane at Marseille airport away from the view of cameras, and was pushed in a wheelchair toward French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, who was waiting on the airport tarmac to greet him.Appearing frail but alert and cheerful, he stood up from his wheelchair to acknowledge the welcome by a military band. Afterward, his motorcade took him through the Old Port of Marseille, where he waved from his small white car's open window as crowds lined the streets. Exiting the car on his own, he took the wheelchair again to enter the Basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde, a symbolic monument overlooking the city, for a prayer service with local clergy.Ahead of what is his 44th overseas trip, Francis acknowledged this month that his papal voyages were not as easy as they used to be. Pope Francis underwent hernia surgery in June, less than two years after having colon surgery, and routinely uses a wheelchair because of a troublesome knee.Despite the decline in France of Catholicism, the once-dominant faith, the pope's visit has sparked huge enthusiasm, with almost 60,000 people expected at a mass on Saturday afternoon. ""Habemus papam"" headlined regional newspaper La Provence, using the famous Latin phrase meaning ""We have a pope!"" used on the election of a new pontiff.After the basilica service, Francis joined representatives of other religions for a moment of meditation at a memorial to sailors and migrants lost at sea. On Saturday morning, Francis will take part in the closing session of the ""Mediterranean Meetings"" event. As well as migration, it will cover issues such as economic inequality and climate change – also themes close to the pope's heart.On Saturday afternoon, Francis will lead a mass at the Velodrome stadium, with French President Emmanuel Macron among those due to attend.

Pope's visit to Marseille rekindles complex relationship with the French,"    Many among the French faithful believe the highly political Francis takes little interest in their concerns, whether liturgical or pertaining to the trauma of sex scandals in the Church. ","Béatrice (all those mentioned by first name declined to be fully identified) still remembers the election of Francis in March 2013. Enthused at the time by the figure of Buenos Aires' former archbishop, she found herself even caught up in a ""pope frenzy,"" she recalled with a smile. The young Catholic from Lyon, now in her thirties and a mother, had even ""liked"" and followed dozens of fan pages relating to the new pontiff on social media.""We had been waiting for a while and I was happy to have a new pope. I had total confidence in him and the institution,"" Béatrice said before admitting: ""I didn't even imagine it could go wrong."" Like many French Catholics who will follow the pope's two-day visit to Marseille remotely from Friday, September 22, Béatrice has an ambiguous relationship with Francis.This is not, of course, an open rejection. The Argentinian is the head of the Catholic Church, and the faithful vow to him the respect and devotion that go with the office and the moral magisterium it carries. Yet, on closer examination, a kind of distance and frostiness seems to have set in between some French faithful and a pope, many of whom feel he never speaks to them. A pope whose preoccupations they imagine to be far removed from their own, seeing him crisscrossing the planet, visiting the furthest reaches without paying any particular attention to ""old Europe,"" unlike his predecessor, Benedict XVI.Many of these faithful noticed France was not the primary focus of the papal visit. The pontiff repeatedly insisted he was visiting Marseille, not France. ""French Catholics are disappointed because, for Francis, France is not a priority in his pontificate. Moreover, he doesn't seem to know it that well,"" said Céline Béraud, a religions specialist at the Ecole des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (School of Advanced Studies in Social Sciences, EHESS).The sociology and political orientation of many French Catholics may also have something to do with this alleged distance from a pontiff perceived, in some respects, to be leaning further to the left politically than his predecessors. According to an IFOP poll for the newspaper La Croix conducted the day after the first round of the presidential election in April last year, most Catholics said they had voted for candidates ranging from the center to the far right.A civil servant and a mother of a large family, Adélaïde, 43, said she did not feel concerned by Pope Francis. A fervent Catholic and ""legitimist,"" she regrets that the head of the Church is sometimes the subject of bitter criticism. But she still thinks that the themes he tackles are not hers. ""Questions about migrants or the environment are important, but they speak to me much less than the dogmatic themes addressed by Benedict XVI. Francis doesn't feed me as much [spiritually],"" said the woman who grew up with John Paul II, for whom she said she had affection.",/en/religions/
Macron's decision to attend Pope Francis' Marseille mass revives debate on secularism,"    The president's decision to be at the pontiff's religious service on Saturday is perceived by the left as a breach of the state's religious neutrality. However, this choice is in line with the actions of his predecessors. ","France's passion for religion has always been ""the first to be kindled and the last to be extinguished,"" according to historian Alexis de Tocqueville. President Emmanuel Macron's plan to attend the huge mass led by Pope Francis on Saturday, September 23 in Marseille has served as a reminder of this in recent days. Invited by the pontiff to attend the religious service he will conduct at the Stade-Vélodrome in front of 57,000 people, the president of the Republic, who maintains friendly relations with the Argentinian pope – he has met him on the same morning for a record fourth time – has decided to attend the ""celebratory moment"" with his wife, the Elysée Palace has said. He was immediately accused by the left-wing opposition of ""trampling"" on the state's religious neutrality.Why are elected officials from La France Insoumise (LFI, radical left), the French Communist Party (PCF) and Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EELV, green party) reacting so strongly to this decision? Because it comes just three weeks after Macron asserted that he would allow ""nothing to pass"" when it came to abayas and khamis, garments now banned in schools in the name of secularism. This decision could be interpreted by some French Muslims as a sign of mistrust towards their faith.On September 15, the head of state responded that he would attend mass as the ""president"" of a secular country, but not as a ""Catholic."" ""The state is neutral, the public services are neutral and we are upholding the same for schools, as we reiterated at the start of the new school year,"" he added, referring to the abaya ban. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne deemed the controversy sparked by the left-wing opposition as ""ridiculous.""The Elysée pointed out that in 1980, former president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was the first to attend a mass by Pope John Paul II on the forecourt of Notre-Dame de Paris, without any objections. ""But back then, the debate on secularism was nowhere near as heated as it has been since the early 2000s,"" said sociologist Philippe Portier, director of studies at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes.Moreover, it is not Macron's first mass as president: he was present at singer Johnny Hallyday's religious funeral at La Madeleine Church in 2017 and at former president Jacques Chirac's at Saint-Sulpice Church in 2019. At the time, ""there was no controversy."" In the first case, however, the young president, who had been elected only a few months earlier, came close to committing a blunder. In front of the cameras, he reached for the aspergillum, used to sprinkle holy water, to bless the singer's coffin – before changing his mind and putting it down.",/en/religions/
Pope Francis leads tens of thousands in mass at Marseille stadium,"    According to the local authorities, there were 50,000 people in the stadium while 100,000 had lined the streets during the popemobile's tour. ","Pope Francis on Saturday, September 23, led tens of thousands of worshippers packed into a stadium for a mass in Marseille after earlier striding into a politically loaded debate in the French Mediterranean city by urging European states not to treat migrants as invaders. The visit by Francis has been shadowed by the controversy over migrant arrivals in Europe, and his plea to welcome people puts him at odds with most EU governments in countries including Italy and France.But the centrepiece of the visit was the mass at Marseille's main stadium the Velodrome – usually the venue for rugby or football matches. The Pope received huge cheers as he closed the service, asking the faithful in French to ""pray for me, it's a difficult job"" his favored parting line.Marseille archbishop Jean-Marc Aveline declared that the pope had been ""baptized as a citizen of Marseille"", again drawing an ovation from the crowd. The pontiff's visit to the Velodrome was ""as if you went to every Marseille person's home,"" Aveline added.Francis had entered the stadium aboard his popemobile after being driven at walking pace in the open-top vehicle through the streets of the city to receive the greetings of residents waving Vatican and French flags. Clutches of black- or white-robed priests and nuns were scattered through the crowds during the service, while volunteers distributed communion wafers.Fans of the much-loved Olympique de Marseille football team lifted up a giant banner of a smiling Francis and the hilltop basilica of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde, which he visited on Friday.According to local authorities, there were 50,000 people in the stadium while 100,000 had lined the streets during the pope's tour.Worshippers cheered when Aveline thanked the pontiff for his ""powerful and courageous words"" on immigration, in an apparent rebuke to French President Emmanuel Macron, present in the stadium, whose government plans to toughen up controls on migrants. The pope's forceful interventions came as the migration debate has been stoked by mass arrivals on the Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month.A French presidential official said that Macron and the pope had discussed migration in bilateral talks earlier. ""France has nothing to be embarrassed about, it's a country of welcome and integration,"" the official said.Francis and the president were set to speak again at Marseille airport before the pontiff's departure.Some politicians on the left have criticised Macron's decision to attend Saturday's mass as an infringement of state secularism. Others on the right have attacked Francis for interfering in domestic politics.The French presidential official said that Macron discussed the ""methodology"" and ""calendar"" the right to abortion in the constitution. Old people risk being ""pushed aside, under the false pretences of a supposedly dignified and 'sweet' death that is more 'salty' than the waters of the sea"", Francis warned. He also spoke of ""unborn children, rejected in the name of a false right to progress, which is instead a retreat into the selfish needs of the individual"".The French presidential official said that Macron discussed the ""methodology"" and the ""calendar"" of a bill on assisted dying e that the government wants to present to parliament in the next weeks.",/en/religions/
'The pope's stardom is a recent phenomenon',    Why does the Church still fascinate us? Historian Alain Rauwel analyzes the Church's social role and influence as Pope Francis visited Marseille on September 22-23. ,"Alain Rauwel is a medieval historian specializing in the Latin Church at the University of Burgundy, Dijon. With philosopher Frédéric Gabriel and historian Dominique Iogna-Prat, he directed the collective work Dictionnaire critique de l'Eglise (""Critical Church Dictionary"") for which he wrote the introduction. As Pope Francis visited Marseille on September 22-23, he analyzes the Church's social role and influence.The ecclesial community is not simply a community of faith characterized by shared beliefs: it's a way of establishing a community that involves individuals and groups in all their dimensions, which has strongly permeated our Western societies.Take, for example, the question of parenthood. Compared to many ancient societies, where kinship was based exclusively on blood, the great novelty of the ecclesial system is that it has introduced a vocabulary and rules of kinship on many scales, to the point of introducing a universal form of parenthood. According to the Bible, aren't we all ""brothers"" before a ""Father""? Our modern vision of fraternity, which goes beyond blood ties to become part of the Republican motto [in France], is thus part of the history of the Church.In the introduction, I refer to [sociologist] Emile Durkheim (1858-1917), who argued that the term ""Church"" could be applied to any ""moral community built upon a system of beliefs and practices."" We considered this open-ended definition to be a good starting point.Initially, the notion of Christianity was linked to controversial contexts. One of the key moments in its structuring came during the Crusades: Various authors' use of this term was not so much a response to the need to define oneself as against ""others."" Gradually, however, the idea emerged of a society in which Christianity would become a total norm and in which all forms of life – not only religious but also political, familial, economic, etc. – would be governed by principles considered to be Christian, under the control of an instituted Church.In the 1930s-1940s-1950s, however, some people called for a ""return to Christianity,"" even though the word had gradually fallen into disuse after the Renaissance. Just think of the philosopher Jacques Maritain (1882-1973), who wrote in 1958: ""Not only is a new Christendom possible, but it constitutes the meeting point of all the energies at work in history since the disintegration of the Middle Ages.""",/en/religions/
What is a synod and what makes this one historic?,"    The plenary council for the Synod on the future of the Church opens in Rome on October 4. Launched two years ago, it is set to decide on some of the most taboo subjects in the Catholic world. Here are four questions to help you understand what's at stake. ","The Catholic Church may have reached a decisive juncture in its long history. The general assembly of the Synod on the future of the Church, sometimes dubbed the ""Synod on Synodality,"" will take place in Rome from October 4 to 29. The agenda, unveiled in July by the Vatican, includes some of the most taboo subjects in the Catholic world, including the governance of the Church, the status of priests, women's role in the Church, welcoming remarried divorcees and LGBT+ people and sexuality.The assembly in Rome will be the last stage of a vast process launched in 2021 by Pope Francis, during which the faithful in dioceses around the world were called upon to voice their opinions on the Church's future. It should be followed by a new general assembly in Rome in the fall of 2024, which will discuss possible follow-ups and most likely a final text from the pontiff.In October 2023, 365 persons from every continent will be meeting to discuss these issues, including 96 non-bishops and 54 women. While this contemporary version of the Catholic synod features many new aspects, it is part of the long history of synodality, a term that has not always meant the same thing but whose goals have remained more or less the same over the centuries: To answer the question of who should make the major decisions within the Church, in a careful balancing act between ""God's people,"" the pope and the prelates.Etymologically, the word first appeared in a Christian context and probably comes from the combination of the Greek words sun and odos, which, put together, mean ""to journey together."" According to tradition, synodical practice is inspired by the biblical accounts of Pentecost or the famous ""Jerusalem assembly,"" when, according to the Acts of the Apostles, the first Christians, starting with Peter and Paul, debated the status of non-Jewish converts.The term ""synodos"" first appeared in the writings of Dionysius of Alexandria, who used it to designate Christian assemblies in Iconium and Synnada (present-day Turkey) that were held around 230. But its meaning was still unclear. In the writings of some Church Fathers, the word was sometimes used to designate the Church as a whole or even, as in the writings of John Chrysostom (c. 344-407), any gathering of the faithful practicing the Eucharist.The term gradually came to refer to the assemblies of the faithful debating the future of their community, which emerged from the earliest days of Christianity, mainly in Palestine and Asia Minor, and often under the aegis of one or more ""episkopoi"" (from which ""évêque,"" the French word for bishop, comes from). These guardians of the dogma were recognized by the faithful as possessing special gifts justifying their authority. The first proceedings (convocation, conduct of debates, consultation, and so on) documented by Bishop Cyprian of Carthage (circa 200-258) attest to the direct influence of the debates at work in the Roman Senate or the municipal councils of the empire's provincial capitals.",/en/religions/
Pope Francis warns against 'ideological battles' on first day of Catholic Church synod,    The staging and organization of the first day of this meeting of bishops and laypeople in Rome on Wednesday were intended to encourage greater equality in the institution. ,"They marched in procession through St. Peter's Square, one behind the other. Laity and clergy, members of the general assembly of the ""synod on synodality,"" arrived together on Wednesday, October 4, for the opening mass of this major meeting that could change the future of the Catholic Church. It was like a carefully staged representation of the place laypeople could take in Pope Francis' Church, which he dreams will be more horizontal.At the pope's request, these synod delegates will spend four weeks discussing the many questions put to them by the faithful from all over the world, who have also been encouraged by the pontiff to give their opinion on how the institution should function. Church governance, the ordination of married men, the place of women and the laity, and the management of sexual violence committed by members of the clergy: There will be many burning issues on the menu of this first assembly, which is to be followed by a second in October 2024.Historic because it could change the way the Church conducts itself, this event – which should serve to give shape to Francis' legacy – is also historic because of the composition of its members, where clerics (more numerous) and laypeople appear to be given equal power. For the first time, it's not just bishops who have to meet and vote on resolutions. Alongside them are laypeople, including women, who marched like the others in St. Peter's Square on Wednesday, as the litany of saints resounded.For the first time, too, the members of the assembly are not meeting in the usual amphitheater-style synod venue, but in the enormous Paul VI Hall in the Vatican. They took their seats on Wednesday morning to get used to the new organization. Gone were the sloping bleachers where people would have been seated according to their rank. This time, laity and clerics together, organized in small linguistic groups, took their places around round tables without any hierarchy. It was another symbol of the equality and horizontality between clerics and laity Francis wanted for this event, but also within the Church. Sitting at the presiding table, itself barely higher than the others, the pope himself took part in this display of horizontality. A few minutes before the opening, Francis went into the middle of the crowd of participants, chatting with some and hugging others.Between the image of a united Church that has come together to ""journey"" (the etymological meaning of the word ""synod"") in order to reflect and discuss its future, and the reality for the Church, however, there is a gulf. Outside Vatican territory, the divisions were already coming to the fore before the synod's work had even begun.",/en/religions/
"'The sermon I didn't want to write,' by Delphine Horvilleur","    In her Yom Kippur sermon on September 24, 2023, the rabbi delivered an uncompromising critique of the policies pursued by Benjamin Netanyahu's government in Israel. 'Beware of power when it simply leads you to want to crush the other,' she wrote at the time. ","Two weeks before the Hamas attacks in Israel, Delphine Horvilleur gave a sermon in Paris to mark the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. ""Worried,"" as she recounted in an interview with Le Monde after the October 7 attacks, by the political landscape in the country, led by an extreme right-wing government, the rabbi had decided to evoke ""this political issue, this threat hanging over Israel in its illusion of omnipotence"" in her sermon. ""When I wrote my Yom Kippur sermon three weeks ago, I had no idea how it would resonate almost immediately,"" she told Le Monde. Here are the main extracts from her sermon.Document. This sermon was written in September 24, 2023. Maybe I should start this Yom Kippur sermon by asking you for forgiveness. Not only because it's the day of great forgiveness, but for a simpler reason, which I could state in a single sentence: I tried, really tried not to write the sermon you're about to hear. But I couldn't not.I told myself, over and over again, that it wasn't a good idea, that I'd better talk about something else, that we might argue... (...)Dear friends, this evening, as we enter the solemn day of Yom Kippur, we find ourselves on an anniversary date known to us all. Fifty years ago to the day, at the service of Kol Nidre 1973, the terrible war that would forever bear the name of this solemn day – the Yom Kippur War – would begin in a matter of hours.You can see me coming from a mile off (or, should I say, with my big guns): Over the past few days, as I've been thinking about writing this sermon, I felt I had no choice but to tell you about Israel tonight, about the pain that many of us feel today in the face of the terrible crisis that this country is going through, the extreme polarization that has brought to power an extreme right-wing government and ministers, an ultranationalist messianism and, in the face of this, for the 38th week in a row, the hundreds of thousands of people in the streets expressing their concern (and that's putting it mildly) for democracy, their concern at the rise of religious fanaticism, political violence, the threat to women's rights, the rise of fundamentalism that suddenly demands women cover up in the street or sit at the back of the bus, that leads others to tolerate or cover up violence by Jewish youth against Arab villages and attacks on minorities, the rise of discourses of supremacy or violence against religious diversity, against non-Orthodox Jewish sensibilities, the questioning of judicial institutions in their role as a counterweight and the increase of populist arguments and ultra-Orthodox demands.",/en/religions/
"Delphine Horvilleur: 'Faced with the Hamas murders, some silences have left me devastated'",Interview,"Le Monde met with rabbi Delphine Horvilleur in her Paris synagogue after she celebrated two bar mitzvahs in a seemingly joyful atmosphere. ""I didn't want to steal such an important moment in these teenagers' lives. A bar mitzvah is a celebratory occasion, not a day for the dead,"" said Horvilleur, a leading figure in liberal Judaism in France. However, in the audience, tearful faces hinted at the dramatic context, a few days after Hamas' deadly attack in Israel. In the face of tragedy, the rabbi called for us not to succumb ""to an absolute dehumanization of the other side.""Delphine Horvilleur: It's hard for me to answer this question because it depends on the time of day. Like many people, I'm devastated and have become totally pessimistic, even though I've always seen myself as an optimist, confident in the possibility of peace. Today, these lofty ideals now ring a little hollow to me. I feel like the ground has given way beneath my feet, like something has collapsed.I could speak as a Jew or as someone connected to Israel, of course. But in reality, I simply have to speak as a human being. We are confronted with images of such inhumanity that the question that fills my mind is how to preserve our humanity, how to make sure that, in the times to come, we don't dehumanize the other to a degree that would confiscate our souls.As much as I can understand that in the Middle East people no longer manage to do it because the level of hatred and rage has reached its peak, we have no excuse here. And I feel anger towards those people from France, who add hatred to hatred and who sink into an absolute dehumanization of the other side. This major empathic flaw is, in fact, a terrible moral flaw, and its repercussion will be the dehumanization of ourselves. It will further enclose us within a bubble of selective empathy, an impossible trust in the words of others because they were not there. We have a duty, from a distance, to be the ultimate guardians of humanity, despite our rage and anger, in the moral necessity of denouncing in the strongest possible terms what has just happened. No cause, no matter how just, legitimizes these crimes by Hamas. No freedom or emancipation can be achieved on the basis of this ignominy.",/en/religions/

Life, all life, is sacred. No one has the right to take life and to break up families. Dominique Bernard was married with three daughters. Who can replace a husband and father?Every joy has been taken away forever, leaving nothing but suffering forever. To the barbaric murderer who claims to speak in the name of our religion, we say what the Quran says about the value of life: ""Do not attempt to take another human being's life, which God made sacred.""(Quran, 17:33). And again: ""Whoever slays a human being not convicted of murder (...) is considered the slayer of all mankind. Whoever saves the life of a single human being is considered to have saved the life of all mankind!"" (Quran, 5:32).And again, in the words of Abel to Cain: ""And if you lay your hand on me to kill me, I will not do the same, for I fear my Lord, the master of the universe, too much to commit such a crime!"" (Quran, 5:28). It's obvious that killing is a crime, and these verses make that quite clear: To fear God requires us to respect the life of others, to respect others.To Dominique Bernard's murderer, who claims to be a Muslim, we also want to quote a famous Hadith [words attributed to the Prophet]: ""The ink of scholars is more sacred than the blood of martyrs,"" and therefore, every teacher represents knowledge. We would like to emphasize that the Islamic civilization was built on philosophy and science; on the thirst for knowledge and on the thirst for learning. And that this thirst is not limited by cultural boundaries: All knowledge and all learning whatever the field, whatever the cultural origin is light, enrichment and fulfillment.The Quran calls on us to make use of our understanding and reason, both in observing nature and in reflecting on life. Reason is not an obstacle to faith in Islam, but a necessary condition of it (Quran, 2:44; 3:190; 10:5; 16:12-13; 16:67; 20:54 and 45:5). And terrorists and would-be terrorists must also be reminded that the Quran recognizes the divergence of viewpoints and identities throughout the world (Quran, 22:67; 30:22; 10:19; 11:118). In Islam, God intended a diversity of viewpoints and cultures (Quran, 7:168).",/en/religions/
Israel-Hamas war: 'Holding to a religious interpretation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict prevents any understanding or solution',"It is more essential than ever to reject the rhetoric of fundamentalism and take a historical approach to this conflict, writes historian Stéphanie Laithier.","Since the morning of October 7, when Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched their joint attack on the Jewish state, Israelis and the wider world have been stunned and horrified by the scale of the massacre perpetrated by these two Palestinian movements.Stunned by the apparent ease with which the terrorists infiltrated Israeli territory and then spread to various locations in the South; horrified at the hundreds of civilians and soldiers killed or seriously wounded – some with their throats slit, mutilated or burned alive in their own homes. In addition to these victims, there are those who have been taken to the Gaza Strip: Women, men and children displayed on social media by their captors as macabre trophies.In Israel, shock, fear and anger continue unabated. The determination to annihilate the Hamas aggressors is strong and widely supported by a traumatized population. At a time when the retaliatory strikes have already caused over 7,300 deaths [according to the Hamas-governed Gaza Ministry of Health], we are entering yet another episode in a spiral of war.However, given the shock felt in Israel and in a part of the world at the nature of this aggression, as well as the thinly veiled involvement of other regional forces, this new stage could well prove to have even harsher consequences for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, as well as encouraging a general upheaval.At the same time, in many countries, some are at pains to condemn the atrocities committed by the terrorists and sometimes even find justifications for them, unable as they are to recognize that these crimes transcend all allegiances to reach our very humanity. The unambiguous condemnation of these crimes is, however, an indisputable condition for any future attempt to implement a resolution to the conflict that is acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians. The Palestinian cause has been dishonored by these heinous acts, and the support it rightfully receives surely deserves better than procrastination or indifference in the face of horror.Of course, we can call into question successive Israeli governments' policies over the last few years, and the decisions taken by ministerial teams which seem to have contributed to compromising the security of their own citizens. We can also examine the reasons behind the failure to resolve this conflict and the resulting loss of hope in Palestinian society.We must not, however, find excuses for barbarity. Let us also not forget that while recent events have pushed the Israeli people into a major crisis, they also represent a political, social and humanitarian catastrophe for the entire Palestinian population, beyond the media proclamations of Islamist activists and their supporters.",/en/religions/
Women's place in the Church is at the heart of synod's first report on institution's future,    The first general assembly of the Synod on Synodality delivered its report on October 28. The question of women and LGBTQ+ inclusion provoked disagreement. Decisions will be made at the second meeting in October 2024. ,"Two years to change the Church. Two years during which delegates – bishops and laypeople from all over the world – were invited by the pope to meet in Rome in October to discuss, debate and perhaps decide on major, even historic, changes in the operations of the Catholic Church. At around 9 pm on Saturday, October 28, the first general assembly of the synod on the future of the Church, or Synod on Synodality, came to a close. This is a major process of reflection on the future of an institution to which 1.3 billion people around the world belong.It was the first step of an effort that will not be completed until October 2024. For four weeks, from October 4 to 29, the 365 members of this first session worked on the life of the Church and how to anchor it more firmly in today's world. The aim, among others, was to better address the existential challenges of a lack of vocations and the desertion of the faithful in certain parts of the world, as well as the enormous crisis of sexual violence committed by priests around the globe.The place of women in the institution, the inclusion of LGBTQ+ people, greater lay participation in decision-making bodies and the fight against clericalism (the excessive place of clerics in the institution) are just some of the subjects on the menu of the delegates's working document, produced through a worldwide consultation of the faithful.It was in the large Paul VI Audience Hall, seated at round tables marking the equality of all, that the synod ""fathers"" and ""mothers"" worked to arrive at the document approved on Saturday evening. For the first time, laypeople, including women (54 out of the 365 members of the session), took part not only in the drafting of the text but also in its adoption, on an equal footing with bishops and even cardinals. This gave substance to the profound change of culture Pope Francis has sought in a Church he would like to see more open to discussion and dialogue.Divided into 18 chapters and 41 pages long, the synthesis report published in Italian on Saturday evening, which the churches will have to take on, does not yet contain any decisions. Each theme is divided into three parts: convergences, proposals and matters for consideration. While the aim of the whole process was to introduce a new way of discussing together and governing the Church, the topics addressed were much broader.Unsurprisingly, it was the themes related to the role of women that dominated the debates over the four weeks. In an atmosphere of nonetheless calm discussion, differences and opposing viewpoints emerged on a subject that remains particularly sensitive today. Women, their place and their role, certainly perceived differently depending on the continent, were also brought up throughout the world in the consultation of the faithful. Today, it was the chapters concerning them that, although adopted, received the most ""no"" votes.",/en/religions/
"Paris Mosque rector: 'It is time to choose. Not between Muslims and Jews, but between humanism and horror'",    Chems-Eddine Hafiz expresses his alarm at the place 'enemies of nuance' occupy in public debate. He argues they're incapable of subtlety when the urgent need is to call for an end to the war. ,"There are times, in the life of a nation, when it becomes urgent to reflect before issuing statements that purport to carry absolute truths, when in reality they mask self-serving judgments. We're living in one of those moments. At a time of dangerous and no less dramatic escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it's healthy to keep quiet for a while before spouting purportedly insightful statements that are nonetheless hateful, confusing and disastrously far-reaching.I have chosen to express myself very little in the media. Today, nuanced and intelligent debate is severely overshadowed by the global confusion of the digital age imposed on us by social media, which have become havens for ideological crooks capable of causing devastating excesses. These enemies of nuance are on the verge of achieving a cultural rupture that invokes extremes without any form of subtlety and favors the pursuit of an ideological agenda over the search for truth.Let's get into the heart of the matter and into the fog of idea association in which we find ourselves. Denouncing anti-Semitism in France would mean renouncing the fundamental rights of all peoples on Earth, including the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. To warn of the rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric would, by the same logic, assimilate you to Islamism. Choose your side. Choose your extreme.So we must explain ourselves, justify ourselves, fight with all our physical and mental strength to save what remains of our fragile humanity: our ability to contradict each other without insulting one another. This is without counting on those enemies of nuance who lie in ambush to assail us with unjust and malicious accusations. There's a manipulative simplification in their approach, which has the ultimate aim of maintaining the climate of conflict that allows them to run rampant for as long as possible.So, according to some of these jokers of French intellectual life, my denunciation of anti-Semitism is a form of taqiya [the act of concealing one's true opinions in order to deceive the enemy]. So here I am, reduced to the racist image of the concealing Muslim, unfit to be a French citizen. What am I hiding? My support for the suffering Palestinian population? It's real, and in that respect, I have nothing to teach the universal human conscience. The images are stronger than my words on the matter. I'm in the camp of all civilian victims and in the camp of peace.Voices are being raised around the world to remind us of the urgency of ending the war and the need for cohabitation between the two states, Palestine and Israel. Muslims in France are subjected to despicable accusations that essentialize them and make them all accomplices in the worst excesses, which are not their own. These accusations are regularly made when some of them – as French citizens resolutely attached to peace and freedom – speak out in favor of an end to the murderous bombardments on Gaza; the protection of all civilian populations, without exception; the release of hostages; free access for humanitarian aid; and the lifting of the blockade on Gaza.",/en/religions/
"Paris Olympics 2024: Security arrangements are taking 'all threats into account,' French government says","    With nine months to go before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, the French authorities are seeking to reassure the public in the face of the increased risk of terrorism, given the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ","The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its flood of tragic images have dominated the headlines since the surprise attack by Hamas on October 7. The ramifications are global. France is no exception and raised its terrorist alert to the highest level following the attack in Arras on Friday, October 13, which claimed the life of a teacher. Since then, the threats have multiplied, at the Louvre, the Château de Versailles and French airports. On Wednesday, October 18, at least 10 airports (Lille, Lyon-Bron, Nice, Toulouse, Beauvais, Nantes, Pau, Biarritz, Strasbourg...) had to be evacuated.In just over nine months, the country will be hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games. It's impossible to imagine that this global event will be immune to the risk of terrorism. How does the situation in the Middle East factor into discussions between government departments on security for the Paris Games? How can we ensure the smooth running of the opening ceremony on the Seine? These questions are likely to feature prominently on the agenda of the inter-ministerial committee meeting on Games security scheduled for Friday, October 20 at the prime minister's office.For the moment, the Games Organizing Committee (Cojop) and public authorities are seeking to reassure people. Paris 2024 President Tony Estanguet stated that there is no plan B for the river parade, scheduled for July 26, 2024. ""From the outset, the authorities and Paris 2024 have ensured that security is the number one priority for the success of the Games. (...) We're not going to change our plans based on what's happening right now, because we've been on top of our game in terms of security from the outset,"" Estanguet assured L'Equipe on Monday. On the government side, they point out that the security arrangements for the Games – ""a priority concern of the organizers and the French government"" – are constantly being adapted to the geopolitical context and the scale of the threats. ""Plan A takes all threats into account,"" said a source at the Elysée Palace, recalling that France experienced the 2015 wave of attacks at the height of its bid to host the Olympic Games.Nearly 35,000 police officers and gendarmes will be mobilized to provide security for the opening ceremony of the Games, which is expected to attract some 500,000 spectators and dozens of heads of state and government. During the Olympic fortnight, more than 20,000 police and gendarmes, assisted by thousands of private security guards on the perimeter of the competition sites, will ensure the safety of athletes and spectators on a daily basis.",/en/sports/
Interview with a vampire expert: 'Our fascination with vampires is linked to our fascination with death',"    French anthropologist Philippe Charlier explores our popular fascination with vampires, which he believes reveals a fundamental fear of otherness as well as probes questions related to what lies between life and death. ","A forensic physician and anthropologist, Philippe Charlier is best known to the general public for his analyses of great historical figures, from Richard the Lionheart to Hitler, as well as Napoleon. However, this astute connoisseur of voodoo culture is also interested in the iconic figures of our collective Western imagination, on the borderline between reality and fantasy. After writing Zombies: An Anthropological Investigation of the Living Dead (2015) and Autopsie des Fantômes. Une histoire du Surnaturel (""Autopsy of Ghosts. A History of the Supernatural,"" untranslated, 2021), this year he presented and edited a work dating back to 1751, Le Traité sur les Apparitions et les Vampires (""Treatise on Apparitions and Vampires"") by the Benedictine monk Dom Augustin Calmet (1672-1757).This book, which caused quite a stir when it was first published, compiles numerous documented cases of vampirism in Eastern Europe. It provides Charlier with an opportunity to question our fascination with these beings who exist on the border between life and death, which are as frightening as they are captivating.Philippe Charlier: Dom Calmet was a scholarly Benedictine monk who rose through the ranks quite gradually to become abbot of Senones, eastern France. At the time, the abbey was among the most prominent in the Lorraine region, with an extremely extensive library. Calmet was an avid reader, with interests spanning archaeology, history and metaphysics. He was curious about everything. He was a great Enlightenment thinker, and some philosophers, such as Voltaire (1694-1778), came to consult him. He was an authority, like Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton (1716-1800) or Jean Mabillon (1632-1707) and so many other enlightened ecclesiastics.But Calmet was also interested in the ""mysterious"" and believed that the vampire phenomenon should be taken seriously. So, when he got wind of a vampire epidemic in Eastern Europe, he set out to find out more about these ""undead,"" compiling information as he usually did. Calmet sent letters to his vast network of European and non-European correspondents to gather as much information as possible. He also read a lot, especially theology and the stories of saints, which he compared with the testimonies that were sent to him.In his treatise, Calmet frequently takes one step forward and then one step back: We don't know whether he believes in vampires or not. However, he contends that there are so many recorded cases that there must be some element of truth. He thus aligns himself with the adage, ""There's no smoke without fire.""",/en/religions/
India suspends visa services in Canada as rift widens over killing of Canadian citizen,    The retaliatory move on Thursday was in response to Justin Trudeau’s claims of India’s involvement in the murder of a Sikh activist in Vancouver. ,"New Delhi said on Thursday, September 21, it is seeking the reduction of Canadian diplomatic staff in India and has stopped visa services, as a row over the killing of a Sikh separatist deepens.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has demanded India treat with ""utmost seriousness"" allegations that Indian agents played a role in the June murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar near Vancouver.The fallout prompted tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions and a forceful denial from India, which said any suggestion it played a role in Nijjar's killing was ""absurd."" The allegation has sent already strained relations between the world's most populous country and G7 member Canada to a new low.""We have informed the Canadian government that there should be parity"" in diplomatic presence, Indian foreign ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi told reporters. ""Their numbers here are very much higher than ours in Canada... I assume there will be a reduction.""New Delhi also said it had stopped handling visa applications in Canada, blaming ""security threats"" which they said were ""disrupting"" the work of their officials. ""For now, the security situation in Canada and because of Canadian government inaction, we have stopped visa services temporarily,"" Bagchi said.Hours earlier, Canada's High Commission said it would ""adjust"" diplomat numbers in India after ""threats on various social media"" against their staff. ""In light of the current environment where tensions have heightened, we are taking action to ensure the safety of our diplomats,"" Canada's mission said in a statement. ""As a result, and out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to temporarily adjust staff presence in India.""The mission did not give further details of the number of people leaving but said its offices were ""open and operational,"" while calling for the safety of its staff to be ensured. ""We expect India to provide for the security of our accredited diplomats and consular officers in India, just as we are for theirs,"" it said.On Monday, Ottawa expelled a diplomat it described as the head of India's foreign intelligence service in Canada, prompting New Delhi to order a Canadian diplomat to leave.The suspension of visas comes a day after India's foreign ministry said it was concerned for the safety of its citizens in Canada because of ""politically-condoned hate crimes and criminal violence."" ""Threats have particularly targeted Indian diplomats and sections of the Indian community who oppose the anti-India agenda,"" a ministry statement said Wednesday.Nijjar was shot dead by two masked assailants outside the Sikh temple he presided over in Surrey, a suburb of Vancouver. An activist for the creation of a Sikh state known as Khalistan, Nijjar was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder. He had denied those charges, according to the World Sikh Organization of Canada, a nonprofit organization that says it defends the interests of Canadian Sikhs.The Indian government accuses Ottawa of turning a blind eye to the activities of radical Sikh nationalists who advocate the creation of an independent state to be carved out of northern India. There were signs of a brewing crisis before Trudeau revealed the probe into Nijjar's death on Monday.India Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed ""strong concerns about continuing anti-India activities of extremist elements in Canada"" in his meeting with Trudeau at the G20 earlier this month. Canada had also suspended negotiations for a free-trade agreement with India, and last week its trade minister canceled a trip to the country planned for October.The affair could complicate US government overtures to India, which have seen both countries steadily upgrade their relations over recent years.

"Benzema, French minister clash over 'Muslim Brotherhood' claim",    Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin accused the French football star of links to the Muslim Brotherhood Islamist group. ,"The lawyer of Karim Benzema has hit back at France's interior minister after he accused the French football star who plays for Saudi team Al-Ittihad of links to the Muslim Brotherhood Islamist group.Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin made the accusations after the reigning Ballon d'Or winner and former Real Madrid forward posted a message on social media about the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas. ""All our prayers are for the inhabitants of Gaza who are once again victims of these unjust bombings which spare no women or children,"" Benzema wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Hamas on October 7 launched shock raids into Israel, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and seizing about 200 hostages. Israel has since then launched wave after wave of retaliatory air strikes, killing more than 3,000 Palestinians in Gaza.Darmanin, speaking on conservative TV channel CNews, alleged that Benzema ""has a notorious link with the Muslim Brotherhood"", a Sunni Muslim Islamist group with its origins in Egypt that is now banned by Cairo.""This is false! Karim Benzema has never had the slightest relation with this organization,"" Benzema's lawyer Hugues Vigier said in a statement. He said that Benzema was expressing ""natural compassion"" with ""what many today describe as war crimes being committed in Gaza, but which does not detract from the horror of the terrorist acts of October 7, something not open to discussion"". The lawyer added that he was planning to file a complaint against Darmanin for his comments.Benzema, 35, who was born in France to parents of Algerian origin, has been one of the standout French stars of the last decade. He joined the Saudi club on a hugely lucrative three-year deal this year after 14 seasons with Real Madrid where he lifted five Champions Leagues, four La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey.But after a stellar 2021-22 season when he led Real to Champions League glory and was rewarded with the Ballon d'Or for the world's best player, he was troubled by injuries that ruled him out of France's World Cup campaign in Qatar last year.Darmanin, 41, has carved out a reputation as a hardliner in the mould of his political mentor ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy and makes no secret of his own presidential ambitions.",/en/sports/
Macron's majority offers tax gift to international sports federations,"    On October 18, MPs from France's governing coalition presented an amendment to the 2024 budget bill. It exempts FIFA in particular, which has a bureau in Paris. ","An amendment to the budget bill for 2024, tabled discreetly on Wednesday, October 18, could be the subject of much discussion. A few months ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, the MPs of the presidential majority (Renaissance, MoDem and Horizons) have introduced an amendment that creates a particularly accommodating tax regime for the 30 or so international sports federations recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).This amendment, which was revealed by the financial newspaper Les Echos, aims to ""encourage the establishment of and retention within France"" of these bodies ""by guaranteeing them an appropriate and sustainable tax framework for their activities in governing sport and promoting the practice of sport, which are carried out outside the competitive or commercial field"" – meaning the bodies' for-profit and commercial activities. In concrete terms, the measure will result in exemptions from corporate income tax, local property tax and value-added tax on profits made in France.The new framework also exempts employees of those federations who are French tax residents from income tax until the fifth calendar year following the year during which they started working for them. This amendment ""is limited in time and, once again, concerns only non-commercial activities,"" insisted the sports ministry.According to a report in Les Echos, which Le Monde was able to confirm, this tax regime was part of the draft budget submitted to the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest administrative court, for consideration in mid-September. But the court issued a negative opinion on the grounds of a ""breach of tax equality."" A last-minute amendment was then presented by MPs from French President Emmanuel Macron's majority, incorporating the Conseil d'Etat's remarks, notably regarding the time limit.This amendment seems tailor-made for the International Automobile Federation, recognized by the IOC since 2012 and with offices in Paris, and the International Federation of American Football. But also – and above all – for the very wealthy International Association Football Federation, FIFA, which has had an office at the Hôtel de la Marine on Place de la Concorde in the heart of Paris since June 2021. The impressive building, built in the 18th century, was partly renovated with funds from Qatar, the host country of the 2022 World Cup.This branch – which was already not subject to corporate income tax – currently employs around 20 people. It was supposed to accommodate 70 people from the football governing body's headquarters in Zurich (Switzerland), notably those in charge of the FIFA Forward development program and also issues of governance and cooperation with African federations. Since November 2022, it has also housed the federation's Clearing House. This entity is responsible for guaranteeing the payment of training rewards to football training clubs, as part of the transfer market, and will not be affected by the new tax regime.",/en/sports/
Rugby World Cup 2023: Argentina's unexpected semi-final against New Zealand,"    After a poor start to the World Cup, Argentina have gradually righted their ship and on Friday will be aiming to repeat their 2020 and 2022 exploits – the only two occasions when they have beaten the All Blacks. ","At the final whistle of Argentina's first match in the Rugby World Cup, against England on September 9, who could have imagined that these Pumas would reach the last four of the competition? Yet, at 8 pm on Friday, October 20, at the Stade de France in Paris, the South Americans will face New Zealand for a place in the final.The Argentinian team's inaugural performance at Marseille's Stade Vélodrome over a month ago reached the heights of mediocrity. Outnumbered for most of the match against a struggling England side, the Pumas proved unable to outwit their opponents' tactical trap of ferocious defense and intensive use of footwork. Add to this their incredible clumsiness (16 handling errors) and astonishing indiscipline (14 penalties), and you had the ingredients for one of the least exciting matches of the World Cup, which ended with a significant victory for England (27-10).Where were the Argentinians who had come within a single point of South Africa (22-21) and beaten Australia in the Rugby Championship (34-31) a few weeks earlier? Well, clearly not on the field at Marseille. ""There was almost no play. There were so many stoppages. The play we did get we didn’t master every well. That was by design by the other team. They did it very well. They put us in that corner,"" commented coach Michael Cheika harshly after the game. ""It was a first World Cup match for the team and for many of the players,"" explained his assistant, Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe.In the words of forwards coach Andrés Bordoy, the team ""took a long hard look at themselves"" after this setback. And they certainly learned from their setback. ""When you lose a match like that, you learn more than you think, especially at the start of the Rugby World Cup,"" said captain Julian Montoya. The Argentinians immediately found themselves with their backs up against the wall: A second rout in the group phase would be synonymous with elimination. On Friday evening, against the All Blacks, they will be playing more or less their fifth knockout match. As the hooker summed up: After the defeat to England, ""We've been playing a final a week.""And this high-stakes approach worked. By winning 13 days later against Samoa (19-10), the Pumas not only kept their World Cup hopes alive, but they also reassured themselves that they understood the fundamentals of the game. ""Against England, we didn't do what we were supposed to do. Today we did a lot better,"" said a delighted Montoya after the match. ""We got off the bus and out of the changing rooms today,"" laughed an only half-joking Cheika.",/en/sports/
"Francis, the grandson of a migrant and a pope",From the Archive,"How many were there? Two hundred and fifty? Three hundred? More? Their bodies lay floating on the dark waters, women, men and children who couldn't cling to a raft or buoy. The ocean had already swallowed their cries of terror as the lights of the rescue ships swept through the darkness, unable to see all the bodies. Breathless, the shipwreck victims had drowned, sometimes torn apart by sharks. Among them were 118 ""Syrians,"" according to the passenger registers – traders from Lebanon or Damascus – but also a great many Italians, who had left with their families, with papa and mama, but also their grandparents – nonno and nonna.This was not the fate of a dinghy in the Mediterranean but one off the coast of Brazil, on an Italian liner – the Principessa Mafalda – launched three years before the Titanic. The liner had set sail from Genoa on October 11, 1927, with 971 passengers on board, the holds full of Argentinian dreams. Since the end of the 19th century, millions of settlers have crossed the Atlantic like this, their entire lives piled into trunks, in search of a peaceful and prosperous land. At the time, Argentina was the world's sixth-largest power, a fast-growing, rich and dynamic country. In Buenos Aires, three out of every four inhabitants came from Europe. They were nicknamed the Porteños (""those from the port""), and rumor had it that the whole capital ""came off a boat.""The Principessa Mafalda had already docked in Barcelona, Rio, Santos and Montevideo. As the ship crossed the equator, the captain organized a party on the deck, complete with a live band. Third-class passengers mingled with the clientele in the lounges. The elegant ladies danced the tango on the two ballrooms's polished parquet floors, where tango master Carlos Gardel, who had boarded the ship a few months earlier, might have sung a milonga.But suddenly, something went wrong. On October 25, 1927, a few days before its arrival, the port-side propeller's shaft snapped around 6 pm. A leak started. The holds were flooded. Ten minutes later, the boilers exploded upon contact with the cold water. The blackout plunged the liner into darkness. At 9:45 pm, the boat sank stern first, taking some of the passengers with it, ""either because they couldn't find a lifeboat or because they panicked and jumped over the railings,"" said former history and geography teacher Jean-Paul Maugis, a lecturer with a passion for transatlantic liners.",/en/religions/
France stuns Women's Rugby World Champions New Zealand with surprise win,"    The French claimed an early lead and defended it bravely, making more than 200 tackles to snatch a first-ever win over the Black Ferns on New Zealand soil on Saturday. ","France used a watertight defense to stun world champions New Zealand 18-17 in a surprise result at the WXV1 top-tier women's rugby tournament in Wellington on Saturday, October 21.The French claimed an early lead and defended it bravely, making more than 200 tackles to snatch a first-ever win over the Black Ferns on New Zealand soil and hand the tournament hosts their first defeat against any side for two years.The result also exacts some revenge for France's heartbreaking Rugby World Cup exit last year, when beaten by New Zealand by a single point in the semi-finals.Captain Manae Feleu said her third-ranked French side had tackled their way to victory. ""We knew it was going to be a great battle against the Black Ferns, they are world champions,"" she said.""We knew it was going to be hard and tough for 80 minutes and I'm just grateful we gave it 100 percent.""Operating with less possession, France opened up a 15-7 lead at halftime through long-range tries to wingers Emilie Boulard and Cyrielle Banet.Liana Mikaele-Tu'u scored New Zealand's opening try but her team slipped further behind when Morgane Bourgeois landed penalties on either side of the interval.New Zealand's chances diminished when replacement prop Chryss Viliko was shown a red card for an illegal cleanout with 15 minutes remaining but her team regrouped and created a try for winger Katelyn Vaha'akolo to close within one point.Black Ferns captain Ruahei Demant said her team would need to improve for their remaining matches against Wales and England.""We were down in their half a lot, but we didn't capitalize on the pressure we were putting them under,"" Demant said. ""We know what the French bring. You can't mistakes because they punish you.""This completed the first of three rounds of matches at the inaugural tournament, which features the six leading women's teams.Canada beat Wales 42-22 earlier on Saturday, after top-ranked England opened with a 42-7 rout of Australia on Friday.Goal-kicking forward Sophie de Goede scored 17 points for Canada, converting all six of their tries, including her own.The fourth-ranked Canadians pulled clear in the second half after leading by four points at the interval.The second round of matches is in Dunedin next week, with England facing Canada in the clash of two unbeaten sides, while New Zealand play Wales and France meet Australia.The tournament concludes in Auckland, where the highlight is expected to be a rematch of last year's World Cup final, between New Zealand and England.",/en/sports/

The three-time champions, who beat Ireland in a thrilling quarter-final last week, outscored Los Pumas by seven tries to none, mixing some doughty early defense with front-foot flamboyance in attack.History was on New Zealand's side coming into the match, the All Blacks having won 33 of the 36 previous encounters between the two sides with Los Pumas claiming two victories, with one match drawn. And although it was Emiliano Boffelli who opened the scoring for Argentina with a fifth-minute penalty, it was not long before New Zealand's dominance shone through.The All Blacks spurned their first chance of a kick at goal, instead going to the corner for an attacking line-out and after a series of pick-and-drives, a long Richie Mo'unga cut-out pass found Jordan and the winger crossed for an easy try that the fly-half converted. As forwards linked impeccably with backs, Jordan then turned provider, drawing in the final defender just enough to allow Jordie Barrett a line into the corner for New Zealand's second try.Although they pinched a couple of All Black line-outs, Los Pumas looked increasingly ragged around the breakdown and consistently lost territory through their ill-discipline at the ruck. Boffelli grabbed his second penalty after a rare show of Argentinian pressure, but Juan Martin Gonzalez handed the advantage straight back after taking out Jordan under a high ball and Mo'unga slotted the penalty.Mark Tele'a showed why All Blacks coach Ian Foster had recalled him in place of Leicester Fainga'anuku after serving a one-match suspension for a breach of team protocol, the winger jinking his way through four defenders towards the line. The ball was worked left by Aaron Smith to find Frizzell unmarked on the wing, the outstanding flanker crossing for the All Blacks' third try. Mo'unga's conversion came back off the post, but at 20-6 at half-time, it felt as if the game was all but over as a contest. That was confirmed just two minutes into the second period as Smith sniped over for a classic scrum-half's opportunistic try, Mo'unga kicking the extras.A streaking break by the fly-half then set up the All Blacks deep in Argentine territory and with Tele'a proving a handful, Frizzell showed incredible strength to muscle his way over for his second try. A raft of replacements disrupted the rhythm of the game, but Tele'a was on hand to draw in three defenders as New Zealand ran through the phases, leaving Finlay Christie to feed Jordan for his second five-pointer.Scott Barrett saw yellow for needlessly playing the ball in a ruck, but Jordan was on hand to finish off his own chip-and-chase for a third try and his eighth at a single World Cup to draw level with Jonah Lomu, Julian Savea and Bryan Habana. Argentina hung in there, however, and at least avoided the ignominy of suffering the highest margin of defeat in a World Cup semi-final, the All Blacks having beaten Wales 49-6 in 1987.",/en/sports/
Rugby World Cup: New Zealand sweep Argentina aside with ease to reach their fifth-ever final,"    New Zealand's 44-6 semi-final victory over Argentina was enough to book their place in the World Cup Final. On Saturday, October 28, they will face either England or South Africa. ","When you think of New Zealand, two main clichés come to mind: flocks of sheep in a picture-postcard landscape, and a dominant black-clad rugby team. While goats are becoming increasingly rare on the island of the long white cloud − there are now just five per capita, a figure at its lowest since the mid-19th century − its rugby team, on the other hand, continues to occupy the heights of rugby.The proof: on Saturday, October 28, at the Stade de France, the All Blacks will be playing in the World Cup final for the fifth time in its history. On Friday, they effortlessly overcame the final hurdle, beating Argentina 44-6 in the semi-final.The day before, Argentina's assistant coach Felipe Contepomi stated an implacable truth of rugby: whoever your opponent is, the match always starts with a score of zero to zero. A way of saying that the Pumas had a chance against the New Zealand favorites and, at the very least, that they would start their match on the same footing. The problem with the All Blacks, especially since the start of the competition, is that this assumption doesn't hold up for very long. Unfortunately for the Argentinians, their experience at the Stade de France was a bitter one. They were overwhelmed by the players from the Pacific, unable to mount a competitive challenge.They opened the scoring after a fine sequence of play in the early stages but only led for six minutes. The New Zealanders then went on to score seven tries, keeping the South Americans at bay. Every time the men in black got close to the Argentine goal line, they hit the target. ""Against a team like New Zealand, the slightest mistake is fatal. They are so efficient. They converted all our mistakes into points"" lamented Argentina's Australian coach Michael Cheika after the match.Among the men in black's attacking arrows, winger Will Jordan is undoubtedly the sharpest: by scoring three tries, he took his total in the competition to eight, overtaking France's Damian Penaud (six tries). If the New Zealander returns behind the opposition line in the final, he will be the sole holder of the record for the number of tries scored in a World Cup, overtaking South Africa's Bryan Habana and his compatriots Julian Savea and Jonah Lomu.A series of tries sealed the fate of the match just after half-time. Although the Pumas, trailing 20-6 at the break, could still have hoped for a miraculous comeback in the second half, a solo try from scrum-half Aaron Smith in the 42nd minute gave his team an unassailable lead and killed off any remaining suspense.",/en/sports/
"Rugby World Cup 2023: The Springboks, South Africa's 'light at the end of the tunnel'","    The South African team faces England in the World Cup semi-finals on Saturday. In a country plagued by unemployment, poverty and crime, their matches − and their successes − are a source of hope and unity. ","It's this woman in her fifties whom we met in a sports bar, who sees the South African rugby team as ""the hope of the country, when nothing else works."" This editorialist, who apologized to Les Bleus in a post on X (formerly Twitter): ""South Africa needed this more than you did. For us, it's beyond rugby,"" after the World Cup quarter-final victory. Or this Boks coach, for whom the matches are ""an opportunity to think about something else."" In South Africa, rugby lifts people's spirits.Even as the competition goes on, the clouds are gathering over the rainbow nation and its 62 million inhabitants. Crime and corruption, unemployment and poverty are compounded by inflation, an electricity crisis, potholes on the road, egg shortages due to avian flu, and the return of cholera to Pretoria's troubled waters. The picture is bleak, and locals are feeling blue. Amidst all of this, their safe haven is the green and gold colors − hope and fortune − of the Springboks.National team jerseys have been snapped up. Those for the 2023 World Cup are nowhere to be found, having sold out in authorized stores. Nike, the supplier, is accused of not having produced enough and of having limited the number of retailers. Fans are so frustrated that one of them sent a long letter to the American multinational to remind it of what the national team represents. ""South Africa is a land of many problems. (...) We have mass corruption, poverty, a health, food, water and energy crisis. There are few lights at the end of the tunnel in South Africa. One of them is our beloved Springboks,"" wrote 33-year-old Thomas Connolly. But despite his lyricism, store shelves are still empty as the semi-final between South Africa and England approaches at 9 pm on Saturday, October 21.Old jerseys or unauthorized replicas, South Africans are invited to wear the national team's colors every Friday for ""Bok Friday."" ""It's good for South Africa, it brings us together,"" enthused Gerrit Kruger, whose children swapped their school uniforms for the nation's uniform on this occasion. ""It's every day of the week that you'll see people dressed in Springbok accessories during the World Cup, we're very patriotic,"" added Non Welsford, manager of the Pirates Club bar in Johannesburg. ""Stronger together"" is the Springbok's slogan.The country has rallied behind captain Siya Kolisi. It's his face that is in the front row as he takes to the pitch on match nights. He has led the way for his teammates and has drawn an entire country into the fray. ""There's a lot to be said for his management skills, his flair and his ability to bring people together,"" says supporter Charl van Rooyen. Kolisi also reflects the image of a diverse South Africa, with its different communities reconciled. ""Rugby was once the sporting embodiment of white minority rule in South Africa, but it has since been transformed (...) The team itself is more representative than it's ever been,"" affirmed columnist Zakithi Buthelezi in the Sunday Times.",/en/sports/
Rugby World Cup: South Africa edges out England to secure spot in the final,    South Africa's thrilling 16-15 victory over England at the Stade de France on Saturday has set the stage for a Rugby World Cup final showdown against New Zealand next weekend. ,"South Africa pulled off a great escape to beat England 16-15 at the death on Saturday, October 21, and keep its title defense at the Rugby World Cup alive, setting up a blockbuster final against old rival New Zealand. One of them will win a record fourth Rugby World Cup.The Springboks trailed for the entire semifinal against England until replacement flyhalf Handre Pollard kicked a 78th-minute penalty from near halfway to edge them thrillingly ahead. From there, the Boks held on and closed out a second come-from-behind nailbiter after the one-point win over host France in the quarterfinals.England executed its gameplan to perfection to be in control, sending kick after kick from the base of the ruck or from Owen Farrell at flyhalf down onto the Springboks, who struggled with the high bombs all day in the rain in Paris. Farrell kicked four penalties and a long-range drop goal to put England 15-6 ahead with less than half an hour to play.South Africa's comeback started with a try to replacement lock RG Snyman in the 69th minute. The conversion put them two points behind at 15-13. The Springboks' set-piece misfired for most of the game but they won a scrum near halfway in the closing minutes and replacement props Ox Nche and Vincent Koch set themselves for a huge heave. The scrum went sideways and the Boks won the penalty they were looking for, leaving Pollard to send the highest of pressure goalkicks through the middle.Springboks coach Jacques Nienaber, who will leave after the World Cup and might have thought his time was up in the semis, put his head down on a desk in the coach's box and covered it with his hands at the end as the Springboks erupted in celebration.",/en/sports/
Ligue 1: PSG defeats Strasbourg while Nice beats Marseille,"    Kylian Mbappe initiated the scoring for PSG in a comfortable 3-0 victory against Patrick Vieira's Strasbourg. Nice secured a narrow 1-0 win against ten-man Marseille, maintaining their unbeaten record and their position at the top of Ligue 1. ","Kylian Mbappe scored one goal and made another as Paris Saint-Germain beat Patrick Vieira's Strasbourg 3-0 in Ligue 1 on Saturday, October 21, but it is unbeaten Nice who are top of the table after a 1-0 victory over Marseille.Mbappe opened the scoring for PSG with a 10th-minute penalty and set up Carlos Soler to make it 2-0 just after the half-hour mark on a wet and windy day in Paris. The reigning champions added a third in the 77th minute courtesy of Fabian Ruiz to wrap up a routine victory. It was a second straight win for PSG following their 4-1 defeat away to Newcastle United in the Champions League earlier this month, and they sit a point behind Nice in second place.""The logical concern with these games straight after an international break is that it is clearly not easy for the players to switch their mentality but the team played well and managed the game very well,"" said PSG coach Luis Enrique. He rested several regular starters with this game also coming just before a key Champions League meeting with AC Milan.Achraf Hakimi and Ousmane Dembele were among those to be left out at kick-off, while Soler and Ruiz came in, as did Lee Kang-in. South Korean international Lee was making his first appearance for PSG in over a month, having helped his country win football gold at the Asian Games in the meantime. ""In general all those players who have been involved less up to now this season did well. They got an opportunity today and made the most of it,"" said Luis Enrique.However, there was no question of Mbappe being rested, and he opened the scoring from the penalty spot in front of an empty end of PSG's stadium, closed by the French league for this encounter as a punishment after homophobic chanting during a win over Marseille last month. The penalty was awarded for a foul on Goncalo Ramos, and Mbappe converted for his ninth club goal this season.South African striker Lebo Mothiba then thought he had equalized for Strasbourg, only for his goal to be disallowed for offside following a VAR check. Instead, PSG doubled their lead on 31 minutes as Mbappe produced a step-over to beat his marker before cutting the ball back from the byline for Soler to prod in.Soler set up the third goal late on for his fellow Spaniard Ruiz, not long after PSG suffered a scare when Mbappe went down needing treatment after Gerzino Nyamsi appeared to tread on his left foot. However, the France captain managed to carry on.Having sent out a team loaded with attacking players, just as he did in the defeat by Newcastle, Luis Enrique must decide whether to play the same way against Milan. ""Each match is different,"" he insisted, ""but my objective is to have 11 players attacking and 11 defending.""It was a third straight loss for Strasbourg, with the club who were recently bought by Chelsea's owners BlueCo, struggling for goals and having won just once in six games now. ""My young players need to learn and learn very quickly,"" said Vieira, whose line-up featured five outfield players aged 22 or under. ""We competed but we made too many mistakes to stand a chance.""Later, the Mediterranean derby was decided when Marseille defender Leonardo Balerdi was sent off for a second yellow card and substitute Evann Guessand headed in the resulting free-kick in the 79th minute. The result maintained Nice's unbeaten record this season under 34-year-old Italian coach Francesco Farioli and left them top, although Cote d'Azur rivals Monaco will replace them at the summit by beating Metz on Sunday.Nice have enjoyed a fine start to the season despite British owner Jim Ratcliffe being focused on acquiring a stake in Manchester United. ""We need to look at the league table as little as possible, but it has been a very positive start to the season,"" said Farioli. Marseille have won only once in four games under new coach Gennaro Gattuso and are seven points behind the leaders.",/en/sports/
"Rugby World Cup 2023: Against South Africa, England gambles on 'winning ugly'","    The last remaining representative of the Northern Hemisphere in the World Cup, England faces the defending champions South Africa on Saturday for a place in the final, despite their crude play and their status as 'public enemy number 1' in France. ","Since the start of the Rugby World Cup, the English team has been accompanied across France by its usual − and noisy − cohort of supporters, but many of them have found fault with the game played by the Red Rose. Boring, in pain, badly outplayed in many areas at every encounter... the British team has failed to convince. And the public didn't let them forget it, booing whenever captain Owen Farrell appeared on the giant screens in World Cup stadiums. But England is still in the running. On Saturday, October 21, at 9 pm, at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis (Paris suburbs), the team will face defending champions South Africa for a place in the final.Before facing (and beating) Fiji − a team that thrilled French spectators − third row Billy Vunipola admitted he was probably part of the ""least favorite team"" in the competition. Is this the downside of representing the birthplace of rugby? Many countries have cultivated an antagonism towards England since rugby first appeared on their soil. Such is the case for Scotland, the English's opponent in the first-ever international match in 1871, and the French, of course, as well as other big names in world rugby. ""Everyone hates England,"" said Ireland winger Mack Hansen in early March, during the Six Nations Championship.Rather than formalizing this label, the team has turned it into a second skin. ""In terms of being public enemy number one, we are happy to take that mantle,"" said Vunipola. Ahead of Saturday's semi-final, a rematch of the 2019 World Cup final, prop Ellis Genge argued that ""the noise and having our backs up against the wall, with everyone wanting us to lose,"" fueled his game. And when it comes to facing the rugged Springboks, who defeated Les Bleus in the previous round, the English will need all their energy. They have come a long way.""The growth in the team is that we’ve learned how to find a way to win ugly,"" third row Ben Earl noted after England's painful 18-17 victory over Samoa on October 7. ""The performance highlighted some holes in our game, but we knew they were there and we found a way to win ugly. Sometimes winning ugly is the most rewarding."" Especially after several years of consecutive defeats.So what then if he has to endure a daily barrage of criticism − starting from his own fans − about England's disappointing game. ""This English team is ugly – no desire, no joy, no consistency,"" wrote former French flanker Olivier Magne on X (formerly Twitter), calling it a ""repulsive rugby."" ""I don't care what people think of us,"" retorted coach Steve Borthwick, after his side's qualification for the last four.",/en/sports/
Tax gift for FIFA: France's miscalculation,"An amendment to the 2024 draft budget aims to exempt international sports federations from taxes. With France having little budgetary room for maneuver, the move looks like a political blunder.","Since his election in 2017, President Emmanuel Macron has made France's attractiveness one of the pillars of his economic policy. The strategy is built around a series of tax and regulatory reforms aiming to encourage investments and employment on French territory.This laudable commitment is about to take on a new dimension with the ambition of attracting international sports federations recognized by the International Olympic Committee. MPs from Macron's Renaissance party have discreetly tabled an amendment to that effect for the 2024 budget bill, which is currently up for discussion and approval in Parliament. They are proposing to roll out the red carpet for up to around 30 federations, exempting them from corporate tax, property tax and corporate value-added tax. In addition, employees of the federations based in France would be exempt from income tax for at least five years.The main aim of the provision is to curry favor with the wealthy global football governing body, FIFA, whose headquarters are currently in Zurich, Switzerland. In 2021, it opened a branch in Paris, which it hopes to expand by employing around 100 people, compared with around 20 currently. But in the absence of a more favorable tax environment, the branch may leave France.The proposed tax break is problematic in several respects. On the legal front, the Council of State warned in September that the amendment could introduce a ""breach of tax equality."" The legislators sought to circumvent this obstacle by limiting the tax benefits over time. Nonetheless, the Constitutional Council could also rule on the legality of the measure.The timeliness of the amendment is also questionable from a purely fiscal point of view. FIFA's current employees pay taxes in Switzerland, while the organization benefits from a tax rate of 12%. It is incongruous for France to enter into a race to the bottom with such a country, to the benefit of employees who are for the most part very well paid and of an organization that churns out billions. With France having little budgetary room for maneuver, the move looks like a political blunder.Finally, if the idea is to raise France's profile by giving FIFA a greater presence in Paris, it is not entirely convincing, given the federation's tarnished reputation. Its president, Gianni Infantino, is under two separate criminal investigations in Switzerland. In Paris, public financial investigators are looking into possible corruption during the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. They have already issued indictments and an international arrest warrant for a former FIFA executive.With its unbridled race for expansion to boost revenues, suspicions of cronyism and opaque governance in awarding competitions, and its problematic laxity in defending sporting values and human rights, FIFA is in no way a guest likely to enhance France's prestige. All things considered, it's fair to say that the Renaissance parliamentarians' amendment is not worth the risk.",/en/sports/
Champions League: Lens salvages draw as Manchester United clinches last-minute win,    Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-1 victory in Istanbul on Tuesday while Jude Bellingham led Real Madrid to a 2-1 victory over Braga in Portugal and Arsenal bounced back to beat Sevilla. ,"Forward Elye Wahi salvaged a 1-1 draw for Lens against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Tuesday, October 24, in a disappointing result for the French team after its surprise win over Arsenal in the previous round of games. Przemyslaw Frankowski provided a cross for Wahi to volley in an equalizer in the 65th minute of the Group B game. ""I would have loved to win the game, that was the goal but ... proud of the team for coming back after going 1-0 down,"" Lens defender Kevin Danso said.Johan Bakayoko had put the Dutch visitors ahead. The 20-year-old Belgium forward broke the deadlock nine minutes into the second half with an angled attempt inside the far post for his first Champions League goal. ""Our destiny is still in our own hands,"" Bakayoko told RTL 7. ""But we do have to beat Lens in Eindhoven, and hopefully that's exactly what we'll do."" In the first half, PSV survived initial pressure from Lens before coming close when forward Hirving Lozano hit the post of Brice Samba's goal with another angled shot.Lens extended its unbeaten Champions League streak to three, with a win and two draws. It's the third appearance for the club from northern France in Europe's top club competition after the 1998-89 and 2002-03 seasons.Andre Onana's last-gasp penalty save secured a vital Champions League win for Manchester United against FC Copenhagen on Tuesday. Before kick-off at Old Trafford, United held a minute's silence in memory of Bobby Charlton after the Red Devils legend died on Saturday at the age of 86.They marked the occasion by claiming their first points in Group A as Harry Maguire's 72nd-minute header secured a 1-0 win. The result keeps alive their chances of advancing to the last 16 but they needed Onana to produce a brilliant save from Jordan Larsson's 97th-minute penalty to see the game out.The spot-kick was awarded when Scott McTominay caught Mohamed Elyounoussi as he tried to hook a ball clear in the box, but Larsson – whose father Henrik briefly played for United in 2007 – could not convert the chance. ""It is incredible and a great night. Especially in the dying second when you concede a penalty, but a brilliant save from Andre Onana,"" coach Erik ten Hag told broadcaster TNT Sports.United are now back in contention to qualify but Bayern look set to run away with the group after making it three wins out of three with a 3-1 victory in Istanbul. Kingsley Coman's early opener for the German champions was canceled out by a Mauro Icardi penalty on the half-hour mark. But Bayern pulled away in the second half, with Kane finishing in the 73rd minute to restore the visitors' lead with his 11th goal in 12 games for his new club. He then set up Jamal Musiala to wrap up the win.Bayern have now won 16 consecutive matches in the Champions League group phase and have not lost at this stage in over six years. ""I don't know how many group stage matches I've done as a coach, but it's always super difficult – so it's great to find ourselves with nine points after three matches,"" said Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel.Madrid, the record 14-time European champions, also have three wins out of three in Group C after Rodrygo and Bellingham scored in a 2-1 victory over Braga in Portugal. Real coach Carlo Ancelotti was taking charge of his 200th game in the competition and he saw Rodrygo open the scoring on 16 minutes before Bellingham fired in just past the hour mark.It was the England midfielder's third goal in as many Champions League games for his new club, and his 11th in 12 matches altogether since signing from Borussia Dortmund. Alvaro Djalo pulled one back for Braga, but Real can secure qualification for the last 16 when they host the Portuguese side next.Napoli are second in the group after a 1-0 win at Union Berlin, who are still without a point. Giacomo Raspadori scored the only goal in the second half as the Italian champions won without star striker Victor Osimhen.In Group B, Arsenal bounced back from losing 2-1 to Lens in France in their last game as they beat Sevilla by the same scoreline on a sodden surface at the Sanchez Pizjuan. Gabriel Martinelli ran clear to open the scoring in first-half stoppage time and a fantastic strike by Gabriel Jesus made it two.Nemanja Gudelj pulled one back for Sevilla but last season's Europa League winners have won just twice in 13 games in this campaign. ""There are not many teams to have won here in the last ten years in Europe and we've done it,"" Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta told TNT Sports.Last season's beaten finalists Inter Milan are joint top of Group D with seven points after defeating Red Bull Salzburg 2-1 at San Siro. Hakan Calhanoglu's second-half penalty won it for Inter after Alexis Sanchez's opener was canceled out by young Israeli Oscar Gloukh.Real Sociedad are level with Inter thanks to a 1-0 win over Benfica in Lisbon secured by a Brais Mendez goal. Benfica are still without a point and staring at an early exit.",/en/sports/
Victor Wembanyama to shine a spotlight on fellow French NBA players,"    After years without a major sensation, French basketball is set to grab the attention of the American public thanks to the emergence of 'Wemby.' Here are the French players to watch in this NBA season. ","The 2023 NBA Draft in June was a historic one: Victor Wembanyama, selected by the San Antonio Spurs, became the first Frenchman selected first overall in this expansive talent pool for young basketball prospects. He was closely followed by compatriot Bilal Coulibaly who was picked in seventh by the Washington Wizards. Never before have two Frenchmen been selected in the top 10 before. With Rayan Rupert (Portland Trailblazers) and Sidy Cissoko (San Antonio Spurs) selected 43rd and 44th respectively, France even came close to its 2016 record, when five players were drafted.Newly arrived in Texas, Wembanyama has declared his desire to ""start a French reign"" over international basketball. To achieve his goal, the alien – as the superstar LeBron James likes to call him – will be able to rely on many compatriots in the prestigious North American league. As the game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Denver Nuggets kicks off the season on Tuesday, October 24, we take a look at the Bleus of the NBA.The players haven't even officially returned to the hardwoods yet but he's already the center of attention. Wembanyama will be the star attraction of the 2023-2024 season. ""I've never seen anything like it in my life. If all goes well, he's going to revolutionize the game,"" said the NBA consultant Frédéric Weis, who will be commenting the prodigy's entire season on beIN Sports. ""With Tony Parker, we had a taste of the media impact this could generate. But this is clearly the next step. One of the best players in the world will be French.""In addition to being the superstar of the San Antonio Spurs, the former Metropolitans 92 player from Boulogne-Levallois (Paris suburbs) will have the difficult task of being French basketball's ambassador in the American league. ""He's the real change: He's going to put the spotlight back on all the other French players,"" said Jacques Monclar, another consultant for BeIN Sports.""I even think he'll be a link between the youngsters and the older members of the French team,"" added Weis. If Nicolas Batum, his captain in the national team, is to be believed, the 19-year-old seems ready to take on this mantle: ""He has the mindset and the talent to cope with all this pressure.""As for the French team's senior members, they'll be doing their best to ease concerns before the Olympics. This is particularly true of Evan Fournier. The guard, a benchmark for French players in the NBA, is going through a difficult time with the New York Knicks. At the end of last season, his coach even insinuated that they were performing better after he was taken out of the rotation. Despite some good preseason games, the Île-de-France native's future remains unclear when he returns to competition.",/en/sports/
Tour de France: 2024 Florence-Nice route announced,"    The new route is set to include 3,492 km of road, two Alpine crossings, a time trial finish from Monaco, and the highest starting altitude of any Tour de France. ","High altitude, an Italian debut in Florence and a finale on the French Riviera are on the itinerary of the 3,492-kilometer route for the 2024 Tour de France unveiled on Wednesday, October 25.The route embarks from Florence on June 29 and features four high-altitude finishes as the race crosses the Alps twice and squeezes in two time trials, including a potential high drama final day run from Monaco to Nice on July 21. It is the first time the race does not finish in Paris which is off-limits as it prepares to host the Olympic Games.As spectacular as it is atypical, the route was revealed at a Gala overseen by Christian Prudhomme, president of Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO, the organizers of the Tour), before almost 4000 guests and many of the expected competitors, mayors from along the route and a large press pack at a conference center in Paris.The Florence start and Nice finish were already known, prompting much excitement about not only the first-ever Grand Depart in Italy, but the race's first-ever finale outside Paris. ""It's difficult to replace Paris, so what better scenery could we give than a dazzling Monaco to Nice time trial,"" said Prudhomme.Instead of the traditional last-day parade along the Champs-Elysées, fans can instead anticipate a potentially decisive individual time trial down the Riviera coastline and in the hills between Monaco and Nice. The stage brings to mind the 1989 edition when American rider Greg LeMond beat Laurent Fignon by eight seconds on a last-day dash.After the Florence start, the race takes in Rimini on the Adriatic coast before cutting across Italy via Bologna and Turin and into France via the Alps on stage four. ""The Tour has never climbed so high, so early,"" said Prudhomme. ""The panoramas in the high Alps are just splendid."" Stage six will catch the eye of wine lovers as it takes in the ""Route des Grands Crus"" between Macon and Dijon while stage seven goes through the vineyards of Nuits-Saint-Georges in Bourgogne.There are a series of stages for the one-day specialists and for the sprinters, but the southern Alps will likely mark the start of the final battle for the yellow jersey. ""Could this herald a duel playing out between two, three, or – let's dream a little here 0 even four contenders,"" Prudhomme said after the 2023 Tour was marked by the two-way duel between Jonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogacar.A more generous than usual 60km total over the two time trials will please faster racers such as Remco Evenepoel or Primoz Roglic. The seven mountain stages, meanwhile, and four high altitude finales with the highest at 2802m on stage 19, will be very much to the liking of defending champion Vingegaard.After Troyes in the Champagne region, the race swoops southeast toward Pau and the Pyrenees, then heads west through Nimes back to the Alps and the mouthwatering finale on the Riviera.",/en/sports/
Swiss probe into FIFA chief Infantino dropped,"    Gianni Infantino was suspected of collusion with Switzerland's top prosecutor, who was investigating a major corruption scandal at FIFA. ","Swiss prosecutors announced Thursday, October 26, they have dropped their three-year criminal proceedings against FIFA president Gianni Infantino over suspected collusion with officials concerning the corruption scandal that engulfed world football's governing body.A probe was opened in July 2020 to investigate suspicions of collusion between Infantino and Switzerland's then-attorney general Michael Lauber, the country's top prosecutor. Lauber was in charge of Switzerland's probe into the towering corruption scandal that exploded at the heart of Zurich-based FIFA in 2015. But he was forced to recuse himself from the investigation in June 2019, following media revelations that he had held several undeclared meetings with Infantino during the probe.Two special prosecutors were assigned to the case, but in a statement Thursday, they said the investigation had closed, with the allegations refuted. ""The criminal proceedings... are discontinued,"" the statement said. ""The suspicion of instrumentalization of the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland by FIFA has not been substantiated in the course of the comprehensive investigation. ""On the contrary, the suspicion was refuted.""In a statement, FIFA noted its ""extreme satisfaction"" with the decision, saying the only surprise was how long it had taken to reach an ""obvious conclusion.""  For his part, Infantino, 53, said it was a ""full and clear victory for me, for the new FIFA and for justice.""""Indeed and with no surprise, the investigation fully and clearly confirms that I have always acted in a lawful and correct way, always defending exclusively the interests of FIFA and football,"" he said, demanded an apology from what he called the ""envious and corrupt"" people out to tarnish his reputation.",/en/sports/

The Pumas brought the game alive by rallying from 13-0 down to lead by one point straight after halftime. England hit straight back and stayed in front just enough thanks to the boot of captain Owen Farrell, who was mercilessly booed all night. In the last five minutes, the Pumas missed a late penalty to tie the score and England replacement George Ford pulled off a try-saving tackle on wing Mateo Carreras.Third place will give England comfort after it was written off before the tournament. England and Argentina combined for only three wins in nine matches in the Six Nations and Rugby Championship but scratched their way out of the same pool to reach the semifinals in the easier half of the World Cup draw. Seven weeks after their drab pool game in which 14-man England beat Argentina on goal kicks, the same teams gave a wholehearted effort on Friday that showed they dearly wanted the bronze medal.Playing Sam Underhill and Tom Curry together in a World Cup game for the first time since the 2019 final paid dividends for England in an attritional first half. They were England's top two tacklers and got the only two turnovers in a first half that was fairly even except on the scoreboard. Curry was superb in a week when he and his family were abused online for complaining he was the subject of a racial slur from South Africa during the semifinals last weekend. Underhill, an emergency replacement playing his first test in more than a year, played like a man who should have started more for England lately.Marcus Smith was on hand to send No. 8 Ben Earl through a gap and soft defense for the opening try. Farrell's conversion and two penalties sent England ahead 13-0. Argentina thought it was playing a Barbarians game and gave up two kickable penalties to try a lineout and scrum, both of which were wasted. The next penalty, though, was kicked over by Emiliano Boffelli, which pleased a crowd of 77,647 giving the Pumas partisan support. Farrell kicked England 16-3 ahead, and just when the game was plodding along, it was given a welcome lift by the Pumas, who swept down the left touchline and finished with scrumhalf Tomas Cubelli diving off a ruck through English legs to score.The game really came alive straight after halftime when, out of nothing, Pumas flyhalf Santiago Carreras slipped front-rowers Theo Dan and Ellis Genge and glided around Smith to score between the posts. But Carreras immediately undid his brilliant work when he was charged down by Dan, who picked up and scored. Farrell and Boffelli had the posts zeroed in all night, combining for a perfect 10 out of 10 goal kicks. Their penalties plus a penalty by replacement Sanchez pushed the score to 26-23 with 12 minutes to go.The minutes were dominated by Argentina but Sanchez pulled his second chance from wide out, and Ford smothered Carreras when he was tearing for the line. It finished the best third-place game since 2007, when Argentina beat host France, and gave England a full set of World Cup medals after gold in 2003 and silvers in 2007 and 2019.",/en/sports/
Victor Wembanyama frustrated and promising in mixed NBA debut,"    With a highly anticipated league debut, the number one draft pick delivered a mixed performance in the San Antonio Spurs' 126-119 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. ","Sport is never more beautiful than when the crowd becomes an actor in the game. When Victor Wembanyama blocked Kyrie Irving and followed that up with a three-pointer at the top of the key almost from the outset on Wednesday, October 25, the decibels in the arena shot up. Very quickly, very loudly, the hearts of the 19,000 Spurs fans started to beat faster, as the walls of San Antonio's Frost Bank Center shook. They were all already crazy about ""Wemby,"" the French phenomenon who had just scored his first NBA points. In the front row, his parents, his sister Eve – wearing a black T-shirt with the front page of the US magazine Slam featuring the French player – and his agents enjoyed the event. ""It was a surreal moment,"" hailed Wembanyama after the Spurs' opening loss to the Dallas Mavericks (126-119). ""I just feel very lucky to be here.""By far the most acclaimed player on his warm-up appearance, the 2.21m giant got into his stride before being heavily penalized for fouls in his first official NBA outing (15 points in 23 minutes). Closely monitored by the defense, the 19-year-old athlete was hampered by the special treatment reserved for him by the Dallas Mavericks. Intrigued by the phenomenon, Luka Doncic – the opposing team's superstar – and his teammates trained all week with arm extensions to better negotiate Wembanyama's 2.43 m wingspan.""Maybe I wanted to do too well, not to put my energy into the right things,"" admitted the number one draft pick, sounding discouraged. ""I don't need to put that much energy into defense. I'm learning for a first game."" Although his NBA debut was less accomplished than his preseason, Wemby showed promise at the very end of the match when Dallas thought they had it in the bag. A three-pointer kept the Spurs in the game (110-108, 42""), sending chants of ""Go Spurs Go"" roaring down from the stands and reviving the crowd, which was a little turned off and disheartened by the numerous loose balls of its protégés (12, in the end).""It would have been complicated for him to finish with an unfinished game on both sides of the court,"" analyzed former French international Ian Mahinmi. For the former Spurs player (from 2007 to 2010) who still lives in San Antonio, despite a complicated match, Wembanyama's second half ""shows that he has character and the soul of a leader. That's important and bodes well for the future.""The former Rouen pivot was far from the only French player present at the Frost Bank Center for the long-awaited debut of the tricolor ""unicorn."" Fabien Garcia, defender of San Antonio FC in the USL (2nd division), was also on hand, as were numerous basketball fans who had traveled thousands of miles to be present for the ""historic moment."" The Spurs, too, are increasingly French-speaking, having already gained notoriety in France during the Tony Parker era (from 2001 to 2018). ""I promise, I'll learn a few words in French this season,"" slipped Rita Pasiear, one of the venue's employees, just outside the players' entrance corridor.",/en/sports/
Rugby profits from growing enthusiasm from sponsors,In Depth,"Of course, the results tell one story: Les Bleus were eliminated from the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals on Sunday, October 15. The Tricolor dream was shattered, and the party was already a little over. On Saturday, October 28, it will be over for good. After the closing ceremony, hosted by the singer Mika at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, South Africa and New Zealand will take the field for the final match. The victorious team will lift the Webb Ellis trophy, and a photo will immortalize the moment.A sad end for France, the host country? ""No, not at all. The adventure continues, more than ever,"" enthused Florian Grill, who was elected in June to head the French Rugby Federation (FFR), an organization that is currently running a deficit. The 58-year-old talks fast and has so much to say and to propose, all in service of convincing people of the benefits of a sport that he played as a young man before attending HEC business school, from which he graduated. ""This World Cup shows just how much the values of rugby – conviviality, solidarity, respect, in short, living better together – are precious and good for society. The public's unprecedented enthusiasm is promising, although I do regret our players' loss. But they're ready to bounce back, have no doubt about that.""Next week, the French sporting authorities will take stock of the enthusiasm generated by the international competition. A few clues set the tone. On that fateful October 15, nearly 16.5 million viewers tuned in to TF1 to watch the match that ended the hopes of the French national team, defeated by the Springboks. Uptil now, this was the channel's highest ratings for the year. Women are increasingly evident, both in front of the screen and in the stands, where they now make up 30% of supporters. The most optimistic forecasts also predict 600,000 foreign visitors and almost €1.5 billion in economic benefits for France. Above all, rugby's popularity is set to rise among businesses, who are sure that financially supporting the game won't lead to burned fingers. The sense of ""team spirit"" at the heart of the game is, in an ideal world, the key to employee motivation and cohesion.Let's be clear: There's no question here of romanticizing the sport by making it into a paragon of virtue. There are dark sides to rugby, starting with the long-ignored scourge of dangerous concussions caused by violent blows to the head and a lack of protection for players. Similarly, the two-year suspended prison sentence given to former FFR president Bernard Laporte for corruption in December 2022 – he has appealed – is a cause for caution. Insults and even punches are thrown on the fields, as this sport is not always played by gentlemen.",/en/sports/
Tyson Fury-Francis Ngannou fight: Why Saudi Arabia is entering the ring,"    On Saturday, the English boxing match between the Briton and the Cameroonian mixed martial artist will kick off the 2023 edition of the Riyadh Season, a festival organized in the Saudi capital. ","Have you heard of Riyadh Season? Contrary to what one might think, it's not the name of a luxury hotel or of a restaurant that just opened on the Champs-Elysées in Paris, but a major festival organized in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital. For several months, the city will host a series of spectacles, huge shows and sporting events.The 2023 event kicks off on Saturday, October 28, with an English boxing match between Britain's Tyson Fury, the world champion of the noble art, and Cameroon's Francis Ngannou, a former heavyweight champion of the UFC – the world's biggest mixed martial arts (MMA) league. These two superstar fighters from different sports will share the same ring.The choice of a fistfight to launch the kingdom's largest sporting and cultural event is no accident. In addition to soccer, Formula 1 and other festivities, Saudi Arabia has also invested in combat sports in recent years. When Fury and Ngannou agreed to fight, the Saudis ""showed interest, organization and logistics,"" explained the Cameroonian giant to Le Monde.This is hardly surprising given the kingdom's recent track record. In 2019, the rematch between the Englishman Anthony Joshua and the American Andy Ruiz took place at Riyadh's Diriyah Arena, a 15,000-seat venue built for the occasion. The SRJ investment fund, a branch of the almighty Public Investment Fund (PIF, $620 billion in assets by 2022), recently became a minority shareholder in MMA's up-and-coming global league, the PFL. And there are also rumors among specialists that the UFC will hold its first event on Saudi soil in 2024.Raphaël Le Magoariec has studied the strategy of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as ""MBS"": ""There's a desire to broaden the range of disciplines in order to become a pole of attraction,"" said the geopolitical scientist from the University of Tours and Persian Gulf specialist. ""And it's being done with sports that are becoming increasingly popular on a global and regional scale, reaching a population that previously saw it as violent."" This strategy echoes the country's buying frenzy of European soccer players this summer, but with one added benefit: As it is still in its infancy, MMA is a less expensive and less competitive investment than football.The PIF's financial strike force also has the power to make everything easier. ""It's a bit complicated in boxing. Everyone has their own promotion and fight organization,"" Ngannou explained. ""We wanted to do this fight, but it wasn't easy until Saudi Arabia got involved. We were trying to get a date at Wembley in England (...) From the day they became interested, nothing was left as a simple promise, everything came to pass.""",/en/sports/
New Zealand v South Africa: The ultimate battle for world rugby supremacy,    The clash between the All Blacks and the Springboks on Saturday at the Stade de France in Paris will see one of the two teams become the first to be crowned champion a fourth time in the World Cup. ,"Just two years ago, the number would have been round, and the symbol perfect. For 102 years, since the Springboks' first match against the All Blacks in 1921, South Africa and New Zealand have been battling for supremacy in world rugby. The two flagship nations of the southern hemisphere, each winners of three World Cups – a record in this competition created in 1987 – will face off on Saturday, October 28, in the final of the World Cup in France (9 pm).""The Springboks and the All Blacks are a part of our rugby history,"" said South African assistant coach Deon Davids in the week. ""Every time we play each other it is always a special battle and I don't think this one will be different."" In 2021, New Zealand fullback Beauden Barrett recounted the moments he spent as a child with his siblings – two of whom, Scott and Jordie, will be playing alongside him in the 2023 World Cup squad. Together, they watched the All Blacks' matches against South Africa at 3 am (because of the time difference), with a cup of hot chocolate in their hands.In both countries, rugby is both the national sport and a religion. ""It's the biggest rivalry in world rugby, and not just because these are the two most successful nations in history,"" said Jamie Wall, a New Zealand journalist and author of The Hundred Years' War: All Blacks vs Springboks). ""A lot of it has to do with issues beyond sport.""Due to the apartheid regime in South Africa – and embodied by the rugby team – the two rivals' matcheshave often spilled over into the political arena. Since the late 1960s, New Zealand civil society has protested loud and clear whenever the Boks have visited the archipelago: in particular, against the All Blacks' willingness to do without their Maori players when they travel to South Africa, in order to comply with the racist rules of the local regime. ""We've gone from a shameful relationship to something much healthier, which has refocused on sporting entertainment and celebrates the best in rugby,"" said Wall.Adversaries in the final of the 1995 World Cup in South Africa – won by captain François Pienaar's Springboks, now symbols of the national reconciliation sought by Nelson Mandela – the two nations have, from that moment on, cultivated their rivalry on the pitch. ""After that victory, we were all out on the streets,"" said South African coach Jacques Nienaber, then at university, on Thursday. ""I watched that final again in 2022, and it's amazing how much rugby has changed. Today, it's a much better quality product than it was back then.""",/en/sports/
Rugby World Cup 2023: South Africa remains on top of the world after nerve-wracking final,"    The Springboks triumphed over New Zealand 12-11 on Saturday. A victory by the slimmest of margins, it made Siya Kolisi's team the most successful in history. ","All it takes is one point. After seven weeks of intense competition, the smallest difference was enough to tip the scales in favor of either ecstasy or disillusionment. And the faces on the pitch at the Stade de France on Saturday, October 28 made that abundantly clear. After an intense and nail-biting final, South Africa won the Rugby World Cup 2023 against New Zealand (12-11). Their victory was earned with a narrow one-point lead, the same as in their quarter-final against France and their semi-final against England. But it was more than enough to send captain Siya Kolisi and his teammates, the first nation to be crowned champions four times in the competition, into fourth heaven.""Coach Rassie [Johan Erasmus, South Africa's coach] said great things are never achieved in ideal conditions. And this wasn't ideal conditions for us as a group,"" explained the South African captain, who arrived singing and holding a Webb-Ellis cup at the post-match press conference. ""Playing the home team in their home country was one of the hardest things to do and obviously, when we played the last game against England, which was tight, we had to fight and today as well, no different.""South Africa didn't pile up the tries in the final phase, nor did they create a huge gap. But step by step, one point difference after another, they demonstrated their mastery right to the end of a grueling journey. ""They've had a tough run and proved they can win,"" sighed a dejected Sam Cane, the New Zealand captain. As four years earlier, the Sprinboks conquered the title despite a defeat in the group stages (to Ireland). The musicians get paid at the end of the ball and, while the orchestra led by scrum-half Faf De Klerk was anything but melodious, it stuck to its score right to the end.The rain that lashed the Stade de France before the final had dampened hopes of an airy, ambitious game. Instead, it augured an old-fashioned game of scrums, up-and-under kicks and minimalist passes. The Springboks' hand-crafted game plan, which they had been following since the start of the competition, was perfectly suited to this autumn weather.We've been here before: precise kicking to move the game around, a reliable kicker and impeccable defense. Theirs is a sterile game, which delights experts with its strategic refinement, but probably leaves most spectators on the sidelines. But nowhere in the rules of this two-hundred-year-old sport is it written that you have to play the game beautifully to win. The South Africans proved this three times in the qualifying matches for this World Cup.",/en/sports/

","World heavyweight champion Tyson Fury beat mixed martial arts fighter Francis Ngannou in a split decision after their boxing bout went the distance in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, October 29.Ngannou knocked Fury down in round three but the 35-year-old British fighter, though shaken, was able to continue. The undefeated Fury earlier this week laughed off his opponent as a ""big fat sausage"" but afterwards acknowledged that the 37-year-old Cameroonian had effectively kept him off-balance. ""He's a very awkward man, and he's a good puncher and I respect him a lot,"" Fury said of Ngannou, adding that it was ""probably one of the toughest"" fights he has had in a decade. Fury was the overwhelming favorite against boxing novice Ngannou.""This was my first boxing match, great experience – I'm not giving any excuse,"" Ngannou said in a ringside interview. ""I know I come up short, I'm going to come back and work harder... now I know I can do this.""Fury's WBC heavyweight belt was not on the line in the ""Battle of the Baddest"" in the Saudi capital Riyadh, but Saudi officials nevertheless hoped it would further boost the Gulf kingdom's reputation as a top-flight boxing destination.With all parties desperate to lend the contest some sporting legitimacy, the WBC had fashioned a ""Riyadh Champion"" belt to allow the winner to strut around the ring at the end with something other than a big, fat pay cheque.Fury has been linked with a £50 million (€57 million) payout from Sunday's exhibition bout, while he has said in the British press that Ngannou will earn £10 million (€11).",/en/sports/
Football: Nine arrested for violent attack on Lyon bus in Marseille,"    Sunday night's Ligue 1 fixture between Olympique Lyonnais and Olympique de Marseille was canceled after projectiles were thrown at Lyon's bus, injuring the coach Fabio Grosso. ","French police have detained nine people and are searching for other suspects after a violent attack on buses carrying the Olympique Lyonnais team and fans left coach Fabio Grosso with a head injury and forced the postponement of its game at Marseille. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said on BFM television that five police officers were also injured in the attack Sunday night, which drew nationwide attention amid concerns about football violence.However, it's unlikely the attack will lead to disciplinary sanctions against the nine-time French champions. Since it took place outside the Vélodrome stadium, responsibility lies with public authorities and not with the club. The case has been taken over by a French league committee in charge of scheduling competitions, and not by the discipline commission.The team bus was hit on the way to the Stade Vélodrome, shattering some windows. Grosso was injured by shards of glass and needed medical treatment with his face bleeding heavily. He suffered a deep cut above his left eye that required stitches and had a large bandage wrapped around his head. Lyon assistant coach Raffaele Longo was also injured. Buses carrying Lyon fans were also attacked.The attack was been widely commented in media outside France and comes at a very bad time for the French league amid negotiations for the sale of its TV rights abroad. Earlier this month, the auction for the domestic broadcast rights for the 2024-2029 period was cancelled after the league failed to attract bids meeting the minimum price set.FIFA president Gianni Infantino said on Instagram that ""there is absolutely no place for violence in soccer, on or off the pitch"" and called on ""the competent authorities to ensure that the appropriate measures are taken.""Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra called for a ""global response"" and said the French league, the teams and fan groups should all take responsibility. Speaking Monday on France-2 television, she called for tougher restrictions on troublemakers. She and Darmanin defended police protection for the Lyon team even though the measures weren't enough to prevent the attack.Marseille president Pablo Longoria said the attack was unacceptable and the club wished Grosso a speedy recovery. ""Because of a handful of thoughtless people, tonight’s party was spoiled and 65,000 fans were deprived of attending a soccer match,"" the club said.The atmosphere has long been tense between the teams, notably since fans from Marseille and Lyon fought in a violent brawl 10 years ago that left 17 injured. Both clubs have been under pressure lately. Marseille is still showing poor form with one win and three losses in its last four league games, and Lyon is the only team still winless in the league.",/en/sports/
FIFA bans Rubiales over forced kiss on Jenni Hermoso,"    Luis Rubiales, the former Spanish football federation president, was banned from the sport for three years following his assault on Spanish World Cup winner Jenni Hermoso.

In graphs: French movie theater attendance picks up,"    As the Cannes Film Festival kicked off, the French film industry welcomed good news: The last time it sold so many cinema tickets in the month of April was 2017. ","With 19.01 million tickets sold in April 2023, French movie theaters for the first time posted a higher attendance than the monthly average from the years before the Covid-19 pandemic (2017-2019), according to data from the National Center for Cinema and Animated Images (CNC). After months of uncertainty and concern, industry professionals see this as an encouraging signal coming right as the Cannes Film Festival kicked off on Tuesday, May 16.Between April 2022 and April 2023, the number of tickets sold increased by 34%. This success is due in part to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The video-game-born plumber drew more than 5.6 million viewers, the biggest performance so far this year.While these figures are reassuring, French movie theaters have seen a significant decline in attendance over the past three years. While they were recording attendance in 2019 at a level not seen since 2011, reaching a total of 213.07 million admissions over the year, the Covid-19 lockdowns forced the closure of cinemas, followed by a series of restrictions such as curfews and vaccine requirements.Since March 2022 and the lifting of restrictions, cinemas have struggled to return to their pre-crisis levels. Worse, in September 2022, theaters recorded their lowest number of admissions since 1980 (excluding the year 2020). Faced with this situation, professionals and the government decided to organize a conference called the Etats Généraux du Cinéma.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Kering's sleight of hand to reduce its executives' tax bill,"    The luxury group paid at least €200 million in remuneration to its executives through offshore subsidiaries. Its CEO, François-Henri Pinault, considered tax exile in London but decided against it. ","It's June 2012 and François-Henri Pinault is worried. The French have just elected a Socialist president who campaigned on the idea of taxing the rich. The reinforcement of the wealth tax, the introduction of a 75% tax on high incomes is hardly a good fit for the boss of the luxury giant PPR (which became Kering in 2013), whose family fortune stands at €6.3 billion.Pinault calls one his friend Michel Friocourt to the rescue to find a solution. After considering various options, PPR's legal director exposes his plan to the CEO in a confidential memo, dated June 1, which Le Monde had access to. The recommendation is clear: Pinault must be exfiltrated to the UK urgently to protect him from François Hollande's ""restrictive risk taxonomy program.""The roadmap, drawn up with the help of auditing firm PwC and several senior PPR executives, calls for Pinault to be stripped of all his assets in France to enable him to benefit in the UK from the ultra-favorable status of ""non-resident"" (""non-dom""), reducing his income tax to zero, while escaping the French wealth tax. To optimize his ""personal tax situation"" as much as possible, the memo also recommends transferring his family holdings Artemis and Financière Pinault to the Netherlands or even transforming PPR into a British group.Leaving aside the purely fiscal analysis, Friocourt warns the businessman of the consequences of such an operation on his reputation: ""A certain press in France will say that Pinault is still and always will be a pirate,"" predicts the lawyer, before offering some reassurance: ""This kind of talk has never lasted long, as we all know. What's at stake is the ability to grow and create, to be free. Nothing anti-French for those who have the courage to understand.""A few months later, the debate over tax exile for the wealthy flared up after the revelation of Bernard Arnault's application for Belgian naturalization. In the face of the controversy, the CEO of LVMH is forced to stay in France. Did the setbacks of his great rival encourage Pinault to be cautious? It's not clear. In any case, he decided not to cross the Rubicon. Despite moving to London with his family in 2014, the businessman remained a French tax resident and kept his holdings in Paris. The following year, he even proclaimed in Le Monde that he is ""a French citizen and proud of it.""The work of Friocourt and PwC wasn't useless though. The set-up imagined for the big boss was put in place for his number two, Jean-François Palus. Also based in London from 2013, Kering's deputy CEO benefited for four years from a contract with Kering Netherlands BV, a PO Box based in the Netherlands with no known activity. According to Le Monde, this enabled him to receive $2 million in net salary, thanks to a favorable provision in the British-Dutch tax treaty.",/en/les-decodeurs/
France's short-haul domestic flight ban: A measure lacking substance,"    Only three routes to and from Paris have been banned, and the measure will have little effect on France's greenhouse gas emissions. ","Transport Minister Clément Beaune was brimming with superlatives as he welcomed, on Tuesday, May 23, the start of the ban on short-haul flights within France. He called it a ""powerful message,"" a ""strong symbol,"" and a ""world first."" But in reality, the measure will have a limited impact on the fight against global warming. This is a far cry from initial ambitions.The idea of eliminating air travel when it can be easily replaced by another mode of transport has been gaining ground in public debate in recent years. The aim is to combat climate change, with domestic flights accounting for around 0.5% of total French CO2 emissions (and even more if we also count the effect of contrails formed by aircraft).The government's measure is based on a simple principle: ban routes for which there is an alternative train journey of less than two and a half hours. In practice, however, only three routes are affected by the ban: Paris-Orly to Bordeaux, Paris-Orly to Lyon and Paris-Orly to Nantes.With fewer than 5,000 journeys a year, these flights account for only a tiny proportion of France's domestic air traffic, which totals almost 200,000 a year (2.5%). The measure affects around 500,000 passengers a year, out of a total of 16 million (3.1%). Two of these routes (Paris-Orly to Bordeaux and Paris-Orly to Lyon) had already been discontinued by Air France in 2020 at the government's request, while the third (Paris-Orly to Nantes) was discontinued at the company's own decision.""A commitment honored,"" Emmanuel Macron congratulated himself on announcing the implementation of the ban. Yet while the president claims to have taken up a proposal ""resulting from the work of the Citizens' Climate Convention (CCC),"" the measure implemented today is far from the initial ambition of the 150 citizens who were randomly selected to work on reducing France's carbon footprint. In its report published in 2020, the CCC called for the elimination of all flights where a rail alternative of less than four hours is available.Although Macron had promised to push through the CCC's ""unfiltered"" proposals, he ultimately opted for a less ambitious scheme. The 2021 Climate and Resilience Act only provides for a ban on domestic flights if the alternative is less than two and a half hours. This theoretically targeted eight air routes, for 12,000 annual journeys. However, the measure was once again weakened when the decree implementing the law was drafted, providing for exemptions to retain certain routes.Thus, three lines were ""saved"" in the name of the inadequacy of alternative rail services. The Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle to Rennes, Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle to Lyon and Lyon-Marseille routes can, admittedly, be made by train in less than two and a half hours, but SNCF timetables do not allow passengers to arrive early enough or late enough at the airport concerned, the government reasoned.Two other threatened lines, Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle to Bordeaux and Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle to Nantes, were ultimately kept in place due to the method chosen by the government to calculate rail alternatives. While it takes less than two and a half hours to get from Bordeaux or Nantes to the center of Paris by TGV, the government took the view that the journey time to Charles-de-Gaulle airport, located on the outskirts of the capital, should be measured. This pushed these links over the fateful two-and-a-half-hour mark, and begs the question: aren't the majority of journeys made to reach the capital, rather than the airport?Implemented in the name of climate change, the government's measure will have only a very limited effect on France's greenhouse gas emissions, and even on the scale of aviation. The savings generated will be in the order of 55,000 tons of CO2 per year, estimated the French Civil Aviation Authority. This represents approximately:It is also interesting to compare the carbon footprint of different modes of transport. On average, a passenger on a domestic flight emits 258g of CO2 equivalent per kilometer traveled (including drag), compared with 147g by car, i.e. half as much, and 3.34g by TGV, i.e. around 80 times less.",/en/les-decodeurs/
"Kering CEO Pinault's losing bet, taxed both in London and Paris","    The boss of luxury group Kering, who lives between France and the UK, is taxed by both countries on part of his income. ","François-Henri Pinault is embroiled in a bizarre imbroglio. As revealed by newspaper L'Informé, the French CEO of luxury giant Kering has been in dispute for several years with the French tax authorities, from whom he is demanding repayment of taxes he believes he has wrongly paid. To no avail, for the time being, since the tax authorities won't listen and the administrative justice on April 12 dismissed France's seventh-largest fortune's appeal.It's a far cry from the gigantic tax evasion scheme in Switzerland, which earned Kering record tax reassessments in France and Italy in 2019 and 2020. In this new case, which concerns him personally, Pinault thought he had the law on his side.The crux of the matter dates back to 2014 when the billionaire moved to London with his family. He then opted to keep his tax residence in France and to pay his income tax there, even if he now only returns to France episodically. ""I'm a French citizen and proud of it. I pay my taxes in France,"" he proclaimed in Le Monde in 2015.All was well until the British tax authorities demanded that he pay taxes on his salary as boss of Kering, starting in 2016. Caught in the crossfire, Pinault found himself taxed twice on the same income. Considering his remuneration, the stakes are considerable: €11.5 million for 2017 and 2018 alone.So who has the right to tax the billionaire? The Franco-British tax treaty, which is supposed to lay down clear rules for arbitrating in this kind of situation and avoiding double taxation, is interpreted differently by the two countries. The UK claims the right to tax Pinault, who spends more than half the year on British soil. France retorts that his location is irrelevant, insofar as his activities as CEO can be traced back to Kering's Paris headquarters.Pinault has been forced to adopt an acrobatic strategy, to say the least: he assumes his role as CEO of Kering from London and that of Chairman from Paris. It's a way of dividing his taxable income between the two countries to please everyone, but it seems largely artificial since these two roles are inseparable.During the dispute, the billionaire put forward a number of arguments: London would offer better ""guarantees of confidentiality"" than Paris, allow him to ""evade daily solicitations"" and facilitate his ""exposure to an international environment."" But these explanations did not convince neither the tax authorities nor the courts. In its decision, deemed ""severe"" by several sources familiar with this type of procedure, the administrative court ruled that his move to London ""was more a matter of personal convenience than a proven professional imperative"".",/en/les-decodeurs/
Attacks against Palme d'Or winner misconstrue how French films are funded,"    MPs criticized director Justine Triet's acceptance speech at the Cannes film festival, arguing that her film was largely financed with public funds. But this is an oversimplified interpretation of the French film financing system. ","An ungrateful Palme d'Or winner? Ever since Justine Triet, director of the film Anatomy of a Fall, took advantage of the award ceremony at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday, May 27, to take a swipe at the government's policies, Macron supporters and right-wing politicians have been criticizing the filmmaker for her lack of gratitude. The subtext was clear, they felt that a film benefiting from public aid should spare the state that financed it.""This film would not have been possible without our French model of cinema financing, which allows for a diversity that is unique in the world. Let's not forget it,"" Culture Minister Rima Abdul-Malak tweeted. ""Anatomy of ingratitude from a profession we help so much...,"" wrote Industry Minister Roland Lescure. ""Share your opinions, yes,  but don't forget who enables you to work and fight your battles,"" added Deborah Abisror-de Lieme, general secretary of the Renaissance group at the French Assemblée Nationale, pointing to the support given to the film's production by the Centre National du Cinéma (CNC, France's National Centre of Cinematography and Animated Pictures) and public broadcaster France 2. For his part, Macron refrained from publicly congratulating the winner Triet, whereas he had done so in 2021 when France's Julia Ducournau was awarded the prize.But behind this near-unanimous condemnation lays a major misunderstanding of the nature of financial assistance for film production in France and the commitments it entails.Anatomy of a Fall was made with a total budget of €6.2 million, half of which came from public funding. Triet makes no bones about the facts: ""Without this cultural exception, I wouldn't be here in front of you today!"" she recalled during her acceptance speech, while calling for this exception to be protected.According to the film's financing plan, published by the specialized website Ecran Total, the various contributions come from the following sources:This means that 35.7% of the film's budget came from public institutions, or 50.2% if we include contributions from France 2, a state-owned company. But this does not mean, as several members of the presidential majority suggest, that the film was subsidized by the state and that its director should automatically be indebted to it. The reality is far more complex. Some of the sums paid may have to be reimbursed, or grant certain operating rights. But none of them offer the state any right of oversight.Since its creation in October 1946, the CNC has been an independent public institution. It does not directly depend on the government, and, above all, it is financially autonomous. In fact, contrary to what has been said, a film financed by the CNC is not funded by French taxpayers' money, but by a system of taxes on the film industry. This essentially redistributive system is based on a tax levied on cinema ticket sales. In this way, Hollywood blockbusters and hits such as Super Mario Bros. contribute to this French film financing fund. Publishers and distributors of television services, such as streaming platforms, have had to pay a similar tax since 2010.Furthermore, the €500,000 ""advance on box-office receipts"" from which Anatomy of a Fall benefited is not a unilateral grant. As the name suggests, the CNC can reimburse itself in part from the film's receipts (from 25% to 80% of the sums advanced, depending on the case, minus a €50,000 deductible). In concrete terms, if the Palme d'Or is a major box-office success, its producers will have to reimburse the CNC to the tune of €350,000.The €1.2 million tax credit from which the film benefited does come from the government budget. This scheme indirectly finances film creation by reducing the tax bill of the companies producing the film.But the granting of this tax credit does not depend on the government, it relies again on the CNC, whose independent committee of experts decides whether a film is eligible, according to various criteria (shooting in France, promotion of the French language or a French regional language, and so on). This tax credit can cover up to 80% of a film's total budget, up to a limit of €30 million. The one that Anatomy of a Fall obtained covered less than 20% of its budget.The participation of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Cinéma agency (in southeast-central France) and the grants from the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region (in the west and southwest of France) and the Charente-Maritime department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine are conditional on the film being shot or post-produced in the regions and departments concerned. This enables these regions to showcase their architectural and natural heritage, which are highlighted in the film, and above all to support local film industries and the wider economy.By way of example, the filming of the chalet scenes in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes departments of Savoie and Isère in Anatomy of a Fall is said to have generated €700,000 in direct expenses – hotels, technicians, various shooting costs – according to director of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Cinéma Grégory Faes, quoted by local television France 3 Régions. As this regional agency is also co-producer of the film, it can also claim a share of the film's revenues, on theatrical or television releases, for example.Finally, it's wrong to compare France 2's support to a public subsidy. By spending €450,000 on ""pre-sales,"" the public broadcaster ensured exclusivity for Anatomy of a Fall's television screening, in conjunction with private TV channel Canal+, which paid €1.2 million.The €450,000 paid by France 2 Cinéma as co-producer also entitles it to a share of the film's revenues.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Rugby World Cup: Springboks hooker Bongi Mbonambi cleared to play in  final,    England flanker Tom Curry complained of being subject to a racial slur from Bongi Mbonambi during the Rugby World Cup semifinal against South Africa at the Stade de France last weekend. ,"South Africa hooker Bongi Mbonambi was picked to play in the Rugby World Cup final after World Rugby found no evidence he racially abused an England player. Mbonambi was selected on Thursday, October 26, for the World Cup final against New Zealand on Saturday. His participation could have been jeopardized if he'd been found guilty of misconduct.The case started after England flanker Tom Curry complained of being subject to a racial slur during the Rugby World Cup semifinal against South Africa last weekend at the Stade de France.""Any allegation of discrimination is taken extremely seriously by World Rugby, warranting a thorough investigation,"" World Rugby said in a statement on Thursday. ""Having considered all the available evidence, including match footage, audio and evidence from both teams, the governing body has determined that there is insufficient evidence at this time to proceed with charges. Therefore, the matter is deemed closed unless additional evidence comes to light.""

Canada's wildfires arrive record-breakingly early,News,"After the Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces at the beginning of May, it's Nova Scotia's turn to be hit by extremely violent wildfires. One of the fires reached the outskirts of Halifax, forcing the authorities to evacuate over 16,000 people from the northwest of the city. Authorities seem to have placed the fire partially under control.Several fires remain out of control, such as the one raging near Lake Barrington in this small province of eastern Canada, which has already ravaged an unprecedented 20,000 hectares (the largest fire ever recorded in Nova Scotia ravaged 13,000 hectares in 1974).In early May, the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan (and, to a lesser extent, British Columbia) fell prey to some of the largest and most violent wildfires in a long time. More than 1.13 million hectares of forest were burned in Alberta and around 850,000 hectares in Saskatchewan.According to federal agencies, as of May 31, more than 2.7 million hectares have been destroyed across Canada since the start of the fire season, 13% more than the average area burned in a full season (2.39 million hectares on average between 1990 and 2022), and eight times more than the average area burned as of May 31 since 1990.According to satellite records from the European Copernicus service, forest fires in the three western Canadian states have already emitted around 20.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere between May 1-18, 2023 – record levels.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Credit rating agencies: The controversial thermometers of the global economy,"    When Standard & Poor's, Moody's, or Fitch downgrade the rating of a government or company, they often further worsen its situation on the financial markets. ","On Friday, June 2, Standard & Poor's (S&P) was expected to release a new assessment of France's public debt. The country's finance ministry eagerly awaited the decision, just over a month after Fitch downgraded France's credit rating.S&P, Moody's and Fitch: These three names regularly make economic headlines and often come with a grade, from good student (AAA) to dunce (D). But what exactly do these credit ratings mean? Who pays to be rated, and how much? Who are these assessors of the global economy? What problems might their operations and business model pose?A credit rating agency aims to assess the financial health of another company or public entity – a country, city, or region. Its primary focus is debt repayment capacity, the most important criterion for investors.Analysts write down different scenarios and calculate the probability of each one materializing based on the financial inflows and outflows of the entity being rated. They sometimes use data supplied by the company or entity under review, or by institutes such as Eurostat or, in France, the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE).An agency also considers more global parameters such as, in the specific case of France, ""social and political pressures illustrated by the protests against pension reform,"" to quote Fitch's April rating. Ultimately, it agrees on a letter grade from AAA (good solvency) to D (bankruptcy). Moody's stops at C, with a rating system slightly different from the other two.Three American credit agencies share the bulk of the global market: S&P, Moody's and Fitch. In 2022, the ""Big Three,"" as they are called, owned 93% of the European Union's market share. And, despite the European Securities and Markets Authority's (ESMA) recommendation to favor one of the other 17 accredited agencies in the bloc, these three behemoths continue to reign over ratings. The French public entities that have commissioned ratings since 2017 have not followed the recommendation and have all resorted to one of the Big Threes.One of them, Fitch, was French-owned until 2018. Controlled by Fimalac, a company owned by French businessman Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, it was eventually sold to the media company Hearst Corporation of the United States. Its two closest competitors belong to two groups specializing in financial information, S&P Global and Moody's Corporation, which US billionaire Warren Buffett partly owns. Since both companies are listed, they have an obligation to publish financial results. They more than doubled revenue over the last 10 years despite issuing fewer ratings.When an agency assigns a lower rating to an entity, it is said to be downgrading the rating, which, in turn, also worsens its borrowing conditions. As there are few objective benchmarks on the financial markets, a rating, even if only indicative, will have a powerful influence. In the case of large companies or entities, a credit rating is even mandatory.A specialist with BNP Paribas, the eurozone's largest bank, told French senators in 2012 that ""All professional clients [investors], from the Nordic pension fund to the Asian central bank, who have years of foreign exchange reserves, have set their allocation rules according to rating: No [investment] limit for AAA, limits for AA, no more than 5% for A, then prohibition.""The various market players closely watch each rating change, as it determines whether – and how much – a state, local authority, or company can borrow from investors and at what rate. In 2009, when credit rating agencies abruptly downgraded subprime mortgages, their value fell on the markets. Several investment funds went out of business as a result.The European debt crisis, during which many southern European countries were relegated to high-risk categories, perfectly illustrates the phenomenon. In 2012, the then Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said: ""In 2011, in Europe, it became obvious that prophecies about debt sustainability could be self-fulfilling. They push up risk premiums and interest rates, requiring larger primary surpluses and complicating the achievement of balanced budgets.""Since the 1970s, credit rating agencies have changed their business model. They used to be paid by the end-users of their ratings, particularly banks, keen to find out where to keep their money safe. They are now compensated by the public or private entity they are rating: Their client is their object of study. Only specific ratings are free of charge – those of the wealthiest countries – because they involve players deemed indispensable for establishing a benchmark. These are known as ""unsolicited"" ratings, as referred to by Agence France Trésor, the government agency in charge of managing the French debt.In parallel with these sovereign ratings, other public entities can request to be rated to subsequently raise capital on the debt market: Regions, cities, or hospitals. According to its latest contract, the City of Paris has budgeted nearly €1 million over four years for rating and ""monitoring [its] credit quality."" On May 9, due to the Fitch downgrade, it and 11 other local governments had their ratings downgraded to AA-.More and more companies are requesting ratings (+20% in 10 years). Agencies are very cautious when it comes to giving their rates. Still, a number of sources told Le Monde an agency charges several tens of thousands of euros to rate small and medium-sized enterprises, and up to €1 million for a large bank or insurance company.The new business model raises the specter of potential conflicts of interest. Agencies may be tempted to soften a rating to ensure that the rated company or entity, their client, will be satisfied. In an email obtained by US Senate Select Committee members during the 2009 crisis, an S&P executive mentioned the possibility of changing rating criteria to avoid losing clients who might turn to competitors if they were unhappy with the rating. Today, credit agencies insist that there is a complete separation between their sales and analysis departments.Europe only focused on controlling these controversial financial players after the 2009 crisis. The ESMA, with which the agencies need to be accredited, can launch investigations if it identifies potential infringements. In the worst-case scenario, agencies may lose their accreditation.In 2019, Fitch was fined over €5 million for failing to comply with legislation on preventing conflicts of interest by rating the Casino group of which Ladreit de Lacharrière was a director when he still owned Fitch through Fimalac. In 2021, Moody's was fined a total of €3.7 million after rating several entities in which shareholder Berkshire Hathaway, Buffet's investment company, had a stake.",/en/les-decodeurs/
"No, Mother's Day in France was not invented by Nazi collaborator Marshal Pétain","    The celebration of mothers, initiated in the United States, was adopted in France between the wars in an attempt to increase the country's birth rate. ","You don't feel like celebrating Mother's Day, and that's your right, so you hide behind the  following argument:It's giving Pétain, the head of the French Vichy regime that collaborated with the Nazis in World War II, a lot of credit. According to Wikipedia's count, over 130 countries celebrate Mother's Day.In many civilizations, maternity is worshipped in a variety of ways (Matronalia in the Roman Empire, the cult of Rhea in ancient Greece), most often in spring, the period of fertility.Mother's Day was introduced in the United States in 1908. In France, several events celebrated mothers of large families: in 1906 in Artas (southeastern France), in 1918 in Lyon... The aim was to repopulate a country decimated by the First World War by promoting a higher birth rate, which had been relatively low in France since the end of the 19th century. A French Family Medal was created in 1920, and Mother's Day was fixed by decree as the fourth Sunday in May from 1926 onwards. This natalist policy, which transcended partisan divisions, is also behind the law banning contraception and abortion in 1920, and the creation of family allowances in 1932.As early as 1941, Marshal Pétain's collaborationist regime gave a new dimension to this holiday, in keeping with its ideology of  ""work, family, fatherland,"" by putting children to work. As historian Françoise Thébaud explains in women's magazine Madame Figaro, ""Vichy asked schools to prepare Mothers' Day with pupils. Posters, speeches, the mobilization of the press... the regime systematized the celebration of this holiday.""After the Liberation, Mother's Day was not forgotten. On the contrary, its celebration was enshrined in law on May 24, 1950, which states that ""the French Republic officially pays tribute each year to French mothers.""The holiday then became a commercial event, soon joined by Father's Day in 1950 and then Grandmother's Day in 1987.Traditionally, the holiday is still widely celebrated in nursery and elementary school, with poems or gifts made by children. After the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2013, controversy erupted as some schools chose to replace these gendered celebrations with more inclusive celebrations of ""parents"" or ""people we love.""In a question posed to the lower house of the French Parliament l'Assemblée Nationale in 2015, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, then minister of education, pointed out that there was ""no ministerial instruction concerning the work done by children on Mother's and Father's Day. These works are not part of the school curriculum.""",/en/les-decodeurs/
French Open 2023: Can you recognize these tennis players' grunts?,    QUIZ: See if you're following the tournament closely enough to recognize these players' grunts. ,"The first on-court grunts date back to 1959, if we are to believe former tennis glories, but it wasn't until the 1990s that we found serial ""grunters."" On the men's side, there was Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi, great specialists in on-court crying.The phenomenon has been growing ever since, to the point that in 2015, the BBC launched a ""grunt-o-meter"" to measure the screaming of male and female players. The now-retired Maria Sharapova reached 101 decibels − as much as an unbridled motorcycle − and Victoria Azarenka of Belarus reached 95 dB.The science says it's a winning strategy.

Annecy knife attack: Three questions on asylum and the freedom of travel in Europe,    The Syrian national who is the suspect in the knife attack in the French town of Annecy was granted asylum in Sweden in 2013 and applied for asylum in France in late 2022. His request was rejected four days before the stabbing. ,"On the day after six people − including four children −  were stabbed in Annecy, the suspect’s police custody has been extended. Arrested by police right after the attack, Abdalmasih H., 31, was homeless. He was granted asylum in Sweden in 2013, but was later denied Swedish citizenship. He entered France in late 2022, where he applied for asylum last November.With asylum reform an ongoing issue in the EU, many right-wing and far-right politicians have responded to this attack, including Eric Ciotti, president of Les Républicains, who, in an interview on French television on Thursday, criticized the ""catastrophic asylum management in Europe."" However, this fundamental right is subject to highly regulated procedures, which do not prohibit travel within the Schengen area.Anyone fleeing war and persecution in their own country can apply for asylum, under the terms of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees. The EU has a common asylum policy, which grants two forms of protection: refugee status and subsidiary protection. Refugee status is granted to foreigners persecuted in their own country due to their religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or action in defense of freedom. Subsidiary protection is granted when a person can prove that they were threatened in their own country as a result of an internal or international armed conflict.Currently, the Dublin III Regulation of 2013 stipulates that only one country deals with the application, which is the country through which the refugee entered, or the country that granted the refugee a visa or residence permit, except in special cases such as family reunification.Once refugee status has been acquired, the length of residency depends on the country. In France, a person can obtain a ten-year residence permit if they are recognized as a refugee, or a one-year temporary residence permit if they are granted subsidiary protection.The suspect in the Annecy stabbing fled Syria for Turkey after the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011. He later moved to Sweden in 2013, where he was granted subsidiary protection and a permanent residence permit in November 2013.Refugees who have been granted asylum in a Schengen member state do not need a visa for a visit of less than three months in EU countries, Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.European Regulation 2018/1806 states that ""given the differences in the national law applicable to recognized refugees and to stateless persons, Member States should be able to decide whether those categories of persons should be exempted, where the third country in which those persons reside and which issued their travel documents is a third country whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement."" After 90 days, refugees who wish to remain in that country must apply for a visa from the country’s embassy.In France, for example, a refugee can apply for a refugee travel document. This official pass is valid for five years and indicates the country or countries to which the person is forbidden to travel, generally the country of origin and other countries where fears of persecution may have been established. This travel document does not, however, authorize the refugee to work or permanently live in an EU country.This allowed Abdelmasih H. to leave Sweden legally in 2022, where his ex-wife and 3-year-old child still live. He went to Italy in May 2022, then to Switzerland in October, before finally entering France in late 2022.""Yes, but in principle such applications are inadmissible,"" explained Serge Slama, professor of public law at Grenoble-Alpes University. Refugee status, like subsidiary protection, is only valid in the European country that granted it.The general rule is that EU member states assume that protection is available elsewhere in Europe, but applications are examined on a case-by-case basis, since exceptions may exist. It is then the asylum seeker’s responsibility to show that their rights are not being respected in the country where they first obtained protection. In rare cases, such as the case of Chechens in Poland, protection has been deemed not guaranteed.Although he had already been granted subsidiary protection by Sweden, the suspect in the Annecy stabbing applied for asylum in three other countries in 2022: Italy, Switzerland, and France. On November 28, 2022, Abdelmasih H. submitted his application while in the French city of Grenoble.If his refugee status in Sweden gave him the right to travel within the Schengen area, he theoretically could not stay in France for more than three months after he arrived in November, meaning he would have to leave in February. However, his application for asylum that he submitted to the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) at the end of November allowed him to remain in France while his application was being processed. All asylum seekers have the right to remain in France throughout the process until a final decision is made.Abdelmasih H. was able to legally stay on French soil for nearly seven months, until OFPRA informed him on June 4 that his asylum application was inadmissible on the grounds that he had ""effective asylum protection in a member state of the European Union."" Having been in an illegal situation for four days at the time of the stabbing on June 8, he could have been handed over to the Swedish authorities, but this is rarely the case when deadlines are so tight.When asked about the link between the rejected asylum application and the suspect’s attack four days later, Interior minister Gérald Darmanin called it a ""troubling coincidence.""",/en/les-decodeurs/

TotalEnergies employees infiltrated COP27 via pseudo-NGO,    The oil and gas giant sent eight representatives to the latest international climate conference. But four attended under the banner of a mysterious German NGO. ,"Do oil and gas lobbyists have a place in negotiations on fighting climate change? Calls to ban them from future COP summits are multiplying, both from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and politicians.In November 2022, at least 636 fossil fuel industry representatives were accredited for COP27, held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh, according to a count by three NGOs. While companies are not allowed to register directly, they circumvent this rule by going through organizations admitted to the COP as observers.French oil and gas group TotalEnergies was able to register its chairman and CEO, Patrick Pouyanné, and three other senior executives on behalf of the various industry organizations with which it is affiliated – Entreprises Pour l'Environnement, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the International Emissions Trading Association and the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association. But this strategy has limits: Lobbying organizations have a limited number of accreditations, and places are hard to come by.To increase its contingent at Sharm El-Sheikh, TotalEnergies found a solution that was as discreet as it was unexpected: it accredited four additional employees via a German pseudo-environmental NGO, International Climate Dialogue e. V. (ICD). The delegation included Patrick Pouyanné's two bodyguards, Jérôme B. and Patrick C., as well as TotalEnergies' international lobbyist, Majdi Abed, and the company's vice-president in charge of carbon markets, Pascal Siegwart. Among the ICD's motley delegation to COP27, their names were alongside those of four Taiwanese researchers.Among the 1,649 NGOs present at COP27, ICD was one of the unknowns. Founded in 2014, this organization sets itself ""the objective to promote education"" through publications, seminars, conferences, public information sessions, and by ""[introducing] new scientific findings"" with the goal of ""furthering political discourse on climate change while maintaining an impartial stance.""Until recently, its website was almost empty. It was suddenly enriched after Le Monde contacted the NGO, but it still doesn't mention the names of its directors or the source of its funding. ""It looks like a front organization,"" commented a Transparency International executive.ICD is actually an offshoot of the Perspectives Climate Group, a German consultancy that ""supports private companies around the world in achieving their climate ambitions and become sustainability leaders,"" according to its website. Founded in 2003, when ""the first theoretic concepts of emissions trading started to be put into real practice,"" Perspectives Climate Group counts several multinational fossil fuel companies among its clients, including TotalEnergies.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Channel migrants disaster: 'Internal inquiry' promised by French government never took place,    The French government had promised to shed light on possible shortcomings from rescue services during a shipwreck that claimed the lives of at least 27 migrants in 2021. Le Monde learned that no investigation has been undertaken. ,"""All the light will have to be shed."" On November 17, 2022, Hervé Berville, France's junior minister for the sea, reacted with a commitment to firmness and transparency following Le Monde's findings about the circumstances of a shipwreck that claimed the lives of at least 27 migrants in the English Channel a year earlier. An examination of the telephone calls made by the passengers revealed that the French emergency services remained inactive for too long, leaving the boat in distress for many hours before it ultimately sank. Officers from the CROSS  regional coastguard center in Gris-Nez, northern France, never sent help to the ship, even though a government patrol vessel, Le Flamant, was nearby.""Of course, if these facts are proven, if these people were in French waters and at any time there was a failure or error, sanctions will be taken. Rest assured,"" Berville promised the Assemblée Nationale, indicating that the government had launched ""an internal inquiry"" in parallel with judicial investigations.However, Le Monde has found that such an inquiry did not take place, despite the judicial investigations leading to the indictment of five CROSS officers and two crew members of Le Flamant on May 25, and June 1, for failing to honor a duty to rescue, liable under French law.When contacted by Le Monde about Berville's statements, French authorities first declined to comment. Berville's office and the general secretariat for the Sea, which is under the authority of the prime minister, said the ongoing judicial investigations did not allow them to elaborate. The sea prefecture for the Channel and North Sea said that ""all CROSS operators currently assigned to Gris-Nez have the full trust of the maritime prefect.""In conclusions recently handed over to the investigating magistrate, investigators say that ""the existence of this internal inquiry has not been demonstrated."" They rely on their exchanges with the administration and the responses of those incriminated. ""As far as I'm concerned, the only investigation is yours,"" said a CROSS operator placed in police custody in May.When questioned about the lack of a government-led inquiry, Berville's office finally ""clarified"" its answer to Le Monde: ""The minister's comments to the Assemblée Nationale referred to an internal inquiry conducted in 2021 following the event. He, therefore, did not announce anything new [before lawmakers].""The problem is that, so far, the only document produced by the government following the sinking of the boat is a report by the director of the CROSS at Gris-Nez, which was submitted to the maritime prefect in March 2022. In this ""feedback report,"" Marc Bonnafous says that ""all operations on November 24, 2021, were handled in compliance with procedures"" and that ""it is inaccurate to assert that the French and British rescue services (...) did nothing and passed the buck.""",/en/les-decodeurs/
"Boris Rotenberg, a Russian oligarch whose French villas have so far escaped sanctions","    The billionaire and member of Putin's inner circle owns a substantial real estate portfolio on the French Riviera that has not been frozen by the French authorities, despite sanctions that have targeted him since the start of the war in Ukraine. ","Who owns the Chemin des Canebiers estate? This vast 30-hectare complex in Mouans-Sartoux (southeastern France, just north of Cannes) includes a villa with a swimming pool, apartments and an equestrian center with two riding arenas and two stables, nestled in the heart of farmland and vast woods. But there's no family name on the letterbox.Since the successive purchases of the land that makes up this little kingdom, between 2012 and 2015, questions have been flying about the identity of the owner. Publicly available documents only hint at the name of a Monaco company: SCP Tannor 2. But, according to Le Monde, the king of this realm is none other than Boris Rotenberg, a Russian oligarch close to Vladimir Putin.According to our investigation – conducted on the basis of confidential documents and public sources and in collaboration with several international media outlets, including the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) consortium and the iStories website – Rotenberg owns a vast, hitherto unknown real estate portfolio on the French Côte d'Azur. Although the oligarch has been subject to European sanctions since February 2022, much of his property has escaped the freezing measures imposed by the French authorities on other oligarchs. In theory, this allows him the opportunity to circumvent the sanctions by selling his properties.The ""Rotenberg Files"" is a collaborative investigation conducted over several months by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) consortium and some 15 international media, including Le Monde, based on a leak of internal data from the Russian asset management firm Evocorp.The documents, more than 50,000 emails and internal documents exchanged between 2013 and 2020, were obtained by the Russian investigative media iStories and shared with OCCRP partners. They shed light on how Evocorp assisted its main clients, including brothers Boris and Arkadi Rotenberg, in the conduct of their commercial and real estate affairs around the world, and more specifically in Europe (France, Italy, Spain, Monaco, Cyprus).The Rotenberg Files also reveal how the use of tax havens and front men helped mitigate the consequences of the US and EU sanctions enacted by Western countries against the Rotenbergs since 2014.Rotenberg's profile is so symbolic that such a situation stands out. Along with his older brother, Arkadi, he has been close to Putin from an early age – they were in the same judo class in what was then Leningrad. The brothers' economic escalation coincided with Putin's arrival to the Kremlin in 2000. At the head of a bank and companies that benefited from lucrative public contracts, the Rotenberg brothers became billionaires. Their proximity to power has earned them sanctions from Western countries. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Boris and Arkadi Rotenberg, as well as Arkadi's son Igor, have all had their assets frozen in Europe.But, to date, only one of Rotenberg's properties has been frozen by the French authorities, according to official records: a real estate complex comprising several villas on a plot of almost 2.4 hectares with a breathtaking view of the Mediterranean, in Eze (a seaside commune near Nice).But several other of his properties appear to have escaped the working group set up by France to detect and freeze the properties of oligarchs under sanctions. According to a confidential organization chart obtained by the Russian-language investigative media outlet iStories as part of a data leak from the Russian asset management firm Evocorp, Rotenberg owns at least six other properties in the Alpes-Maritimes: the Domaine des Canebiers, in Mouans-Sartoux; another villa just a stone's throw away in the same commune; a house in Grasse; an apartment and building plots in Eze; and commercial premises in Carros.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Paris 2024: French police raid Olympics HQ in suspected corruption probe,    The raid is part of two judicial investigations into favoritism and misappropriation of public funds. ,"On Tuesday, June 20, a number of facilities linked to the organization of the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games were raided as part of two judicial investigations into suspected irregularities in public procurement contracts.Police officers went to the offices of the Organizing Committee (Cojop), in Saint-Denis (Seine-Saint-Denis, northern suburbs of Paris), of the public establishment in charge of Olympic infrastructures (Solideo), in Paris, and to the headquarters of several companies and consultants linked to the organization of the Games, in Paris and the suburbs.According to Le Monde's information, confirmed by the National Financial Prosecutor's Office (PNF), the first procedure, opened in 2022, follows an audit by the French anticorruption agency (AFA), which uncovered possible irregularities in certain public contracts awarded by Cojop and Solideo. The procedure, entrusted to the Economic Crime Squad, concerns illegal interest-taking, favoritism and the concealment of favoritism.In two reports drawn up in early 2021, the existence of which had been made public by Le Canard Enchaîné, the AFA expressed concern about the serious risks of ""conflicts of interest"" and ""breaches of probity"" in the awarding of public contracts linked to the organization of the 2024 Games. In particular, the organization pointed to insufficient safeguards in the procedures, and a ""risk of illegal taking of interest when its employees leave for the private sector.""The other investigation, opened in 2017, concerns suspicions of misappropriation of public funds, favoritism and the concealment of favoritism following a public contract awarded by Cojop to a particular company. It targets several contracts awarded ""by several successive contracting authorities linked to the Olympic Games, in particular Cojop and GIP 2024 [bid committee],"" explains the PNF. The investigation has been entrusted to police officers from the Central Office for Combating Corruption and Financial and Tax Offenses.The office of the Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo confirmed to Le Monde the morning searches at the offices of Cojop and Solideo were in connection with contracts awarded by the two entities. Solideo told us that it was ""cooperating fully with the investigators to facilitate their investigations."" Cojop's president Tony Estanguet, its deputy director of legal affairs Romain Voillemot and the AFA have not yet responded.Cojop Paris 2024 is not the only Olympic Games organizing committee to have been rocked by judicial investigations. In 2021, the former Brazilian president of the Rio 2016 Olympic Organizing Committee, Carlos Nuzman, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for corruption, money laundering and currency evasion.",/en/les-decodeurs/
South Africa beat New Zealand 12-11 to win record fourth Rugby World Cup,    Handre Pollard kicked four penalties to help South Africa to a nail-biting victory over 14-man New Zealand in the Rugby World Cup final on Saturday to claim a record fourth title. ,"Defending champion South Africa kicked its way to a record fourth Rugby World Cup title by beating New Zealand 12-11 on Saturday, October 28, after All Blacks captain Sam Cane was the first player to be red-carded in a final.Flyhalf Handre Pollard scored all the points for a Springboks side which repeated its 1995 success over New Zealand and denied the All Blacks their own chance to win a fourth title in their record fifth final.Cane was shown the red card for a high tackle on center Jesse Kriel. Three other players were sin-binned – two Springboks and one All Black – in a chaotic match.Fullback Beauden Barrett scored the only try of the game in the left corner, setting up a tense last 20 minutes.He became the first player to score in two World Cup finals and scored the first try conceded by South Africa in a final. But flyhalf Richie Mo'unga’s touchline conversion attempt went wide and ultimately preserved the winning margin.Both sides finished with 14 players as left winger Cheslin Kolbe was sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on. Center Jordie Barrett took the penalty shot from nearly 50 meters wide of the right post but it sailed wide with Kolbe holding his head in his hands, unable to watch.Cane was sin-binned but referee Wayne Barnes pulled out the dreaded red after the punishment was upgraded late in the first half following a bunker review.The All Blacks had already had a yellow card after three minutes to flanker Shannon Frizell. Springboks captain Siya Kolisi was sin-binned early in the second half, for another high tackle, evening the numbers with the score 12-6 to South Africa.Saturday’s 106th showdown between the gigantic rivals was played on a wet field and pitted the two top-ranked sides. Tennis stars Roger Federer, wearing a South Africa scarf, and Novak Djokovic were among the crowd of 80,065 who witnessed a gripping but scrappy game.New Zealand scrumhalf Aaron Smith dived over in the left corner early in the second half but the try was ruled out. Mo’unga made a great break from midfield, dummied inside fullback Damian Willemse and fed Smith to dive over. But yet another TMO decision ruled out the try for a knock-on in the buildup.Kolisi's card was not upgraded and he came back on moments later with 25 minutes left to play. New Zealand was on top and a brilliant improvised one-handed looping pass from Jordie Barrett found wing Mark Tele’a, and he slipped two tackles before feeding Beauden Barrett in the left corner.It gave New Zealand hope, but in the end Kolisi became only the second skipper to lead a team to back-to-back World Cup victories after New Zealand great Richie McCaw.",/en/sports/
The French bank favored by Russian oligarch Boris Rotenberg,"    Société Générale has opened numerous accounts for the Russian oligarch and his companies, a number of them in opaque tax havens. ","The judicial enquiry opened by the Paris public prosecutor's office on September 8 2022 into the financing of Boris Rotenberg's property holdings in France will inevitably lead the police investigating the case to Société Générale. The Monaco subsidiary of the French bank managed the Russian oligarch's various personal accounts, as well as those of his offshore companies based in the opaque tax haven of the British Virgin Islands.Numerous confidential documents consulted by Le Monde as part of the ""Rotenberg Files"" show how Société Générale enlisted the help of its Russian-speaking employees in Monaco to offer top-quality service to its special Russian client, who spent much of his time there before Russia invaded Ukraine. Services offered included account management, investment in financial products and bank loans.The business relationship appeared to be excellent until Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Although initially spared by the European sanctions imposed immediately  against several Russian personalities – including his brother Arkadi – Rotenberg was placed under US sanctions in March 2014. For the French bank, this was a tricky situation to manage, as it was theoretically accountable to the American authorities and had to comply with the restrictions imposed by the Obama administration. This was especially true as the oligarch held dollar-denominated financial products.The ""Rotenberg Files"" is a collaborative investigation conducted over several months by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) consortium and some 15 international media, including Le Monde, based on a leak of internal data from the Russian asset management firm Evocorp.The documents, more than 50,000 emails and internal documents exchanged between 2013 and 2020, were obtained by the Russian investigative media iStories and shared with OCCRP partners. They shed light on how Evocorp assisted its main clients, including brothers Boris and Arkadi Rotenberg, in the conduct of their commercial and real estate affairs around the world, and more specifically in Europe (France, Italy, Spain, Monaco, Cyprus).The Rotenberg Files also reveal how the use of tax havens and front men helped mitigate the consequences of the US and EU sanctions enacted by Western countries against the Rotenbergs since 2014.Against this backdrop, staff at Société Générale's ""Russian desk"" in Monaco worried about certain transfers or changes made between the managers of several offshore companies whose accounts it administered. Even though anti-money laundering legislation required it to carry out drastic checks, the bank failed to obtain satisfactory justification from the Rotenberg team despite repeated questions and reminders.Société Générale finally informed Rotenberg that it wished to close his personal account. ""It is no longer appropriate for us to maintain our relationship with you,"" wrote Alexandre Rousseau, head of private banking in Monaco, to Rotenberg in February 2017. Simultaneously, a solution had to be found to another thorny problem: Several property loans taken out by the oligarch, totaling €20 million, expired in 2015 and 2016, without repayment to the bank.Rotenberg had opted to borrow in order to purchase his many properties in France, owned directly or through a cascade of foreign companies. This choice was not made out of financial necessity, as his fortune exceeded one billion euros by 2022, according to Forbes magazine. But debt provides a tax advantage. It allows the payment of real estate wealth tax to be deferred for several years.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Riots in France: How a fundraising campaign became a flashpoint in a divided country,"    Set up by far-right figure Jean Messiha, the online fund for the family of the police officer who shot dead Nahel M. has raised more than €1 million. ","""The intensive care units are going to be saturated by an influx of lefties in the fetal position! Bravo to everyone and vive la France!"" On Twitter, his platform of choice, Jean Messiha is jubilant. The far-right polemicist and former member of Eric Zemmour's Reconquête ! movement is lashing out at the ""lefties"" who have failed to shut down the fund he launched for the family of the police officer indicted after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Nahel M, whose death was the flashpoint for the wave of riots that have hit France.The success of the fund is undeniable. By midday on Monday, July 3, it had exceeded €1 million in pledges. This is four times more than the anonymous fund in support of Nahel's mother, which has not topped €250,000. This was enough to infuriate some members of the public, who have been calling for several days for the online fund to be shut down. Dozens of appeals, including from politicians such as Socialist Olivier Faure, have been made to the US donations site GoFundMe, which is hosting the fund.When contacted, the company said: ""For now, this fund respects our terms of service, since it specifies that the funds are intended to support the family. They have been added as beneficiaries, so the money will go directly to them.""The story has a precedent. In 2019, a fund was opened to support the Yellow Vest and former professional boxer Christophe Dettinger, who was filmed fighting the police with his fists. A relative of the boxer opened an online Leetchi fund to support him, which garnered more than €145,000 before the platform decided to close it in the face of strong criticism from political figures, including members of the government and police unions.Messiha had initially launched a fundraising campaign on Leetchi on June 29. However, the platform – where another campaign, initiated by the officer's colleagues, raised €61,000 – requested (according to Leetchi) several documents to justify the collection of funds, such as the officer's marriage certificate. So Messiha switched to GoFundMe, with striking success.According to data collected by Le Monde, in less than three hours on July 3, the fund collected more than €143,000 euros, an average of almost €25 per contributor. This reflects an acceleration in donations since the opening of the fund, which in four days has collected more than €1 million in donations from 54,000 contributors. Of these, at least 79 have donated amounts in excess of €200, with the largest sum so far being €3,000 – from an anonymous donor.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Russian oligarchs Boris and Arkady Rotenberg evade sanctions with often rudimentary methods,"    The two brothers, who became billionaires after their childhood friend Vladimir Putin came to power, have been sanctioned by the EU and the US since the invasion of Crimea in 2014. But they have still managed to preserve their economic empire. ","""Objective: Clear sanctions."" In May 2014, the tenor of the exchanges between the Rotenberg clan and the manager of their assets was explicit. Boris and his older brother Arkady did not intend to stand idly by in the face of the restrictive sanctions adopted against them by the United States following Russia's annexation of Crimea. Boris was also high on the European sanctions list.To neutralize the economic effects of the sanctions, the two brothers, who quickly became billionaires after their childhood friend Vladimir Putin came to power, relied on the skills of Maxim Viktorov, a Russian businessman and lawyer whose role was paramount in managing their assets after the first sanctions. It was to him that the May 2014 letter sent by Roman Rotenberg, Boris's son, was addressed. ""We need to discuss and prepare documents,"" Roman wrote to Viktorov.The issue in question concerned the young man's purchase of his father's and uncle's shares in Helsinki Halli, a major sports and entertainment venue in the Finnish capital. But the Rotenbergs' separation from the venue was only a façade, as their lawyer was preparing another, secret contract to reverse the deal. This authorized the brothers to buy back the shares they had sold, whenever they wanted to and at the same price. ""These documents should be prepared inside the family by a trusted lawyer and nobody else should know about their existence,"" stated the memo, which comes from leaked data from Maxim Victorov's management company, Evocorp, obtained by the Russian-language investigative website iStories, of which Le Monde is a partner. The plan appears to have been successful: For years, the Rotenberg family managed to hold on to their shares through Roman – until the latter was himself targeted by US sanctions in March 2022, following the invasion of Ukraine.Evocorp documents show that the US blacklisting in 2014 was the biggest threat to Boris Rotenberg's wealth outside Russia. In response, the sanctions-avoidance strategy was to keep changing the companies and countries of operations. In this global hide-and-seek, Viktorov's companies acted as the control tower.The ""Rotenberg Files"" is a collaborative investigation conducted over several months by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) consortium and some 15 international media, including Le Monde, based on a leak of internal data from the Russian asset management firm Evocorp.The documents, more than 50,000 emails and internal documents exchanged between 2013 and 2020, were obtained by the Russian investigative media iStories and shared with OCCRP partners.

Unavoidable points of passage for dirty money from all over the world, these territories are nevertheless careful not to find themselves in the crosshairs of the US administration. In the British Virgin Islands (BVI), the financial authorities pay particular attention to ensuring that no one under sanctions from the US is among the clients of its financial sector. In 2016, firms domiciling shell companies were reminded of their obligations to comply with sanctions programs and asked to clean up their act accordingly.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Nanterre police shooting: Under what circumstances are police officers allowed to use firearms?,"    The death of 17-year-old Nahel M. is raising questions about France's law concerning gun use, especially as the country has seen a rise in police resorting to these weapons. ","The death of 17-year-old Nahel M., killed during a police check in Nanterre on the morning of Tuesday, June 27, has sparked a wave of strong emotions. In a rare move, MPs observed a minute's silence in the Assemblée Nationale, while Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne declared in the Sénat that the police intervention ""clearly does not appear to comply with the rules of engagement of our law enforcement agencies."" The fatal shooting has reopened the issue of the rules governing the use of weapons by police officers and armed police. In 2022, 13 people died after refusing to comply with road checks, according to a count by French news agency Agence France-Presse.The use of weapons in the direction of ""moving vehicles"" – a category that includes refusing to comply – by police officers has also increased. The General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN) reports that between 2012 and 2015, there were an average of around 115 shootings per year, rising to over 150 per year in 2020 and 2021.According to Article 435-1 of the French National Security Code, police officers are only entitled to use a weapon in five clearly described situations:Introduced by the reform of February 28, 2017, Article 435-1 is a provision applicable to both the armed units and the national police. This is a common system that has not always existed. Prior to 2017, only armed police were subject to specific rules regarding the use of their firearms, with the law authorizing it in four situations – those set out in the 2017 law except for the last point.Before the reform, police officers were subject to the same rules as the rest of the public, namely that firing a firearm is an offense, ""unless the conditions of irresponsibility are met or it is a case of self-defense,"" Méryl Recotillet, a lawyer specializing in criminal law, told Le Monde. ""If the police officer uses his weapon, he has to demonstrate self-defense,"" she added.The legislation is ""more vague than precise,"" Christian Mouhanna, a sociologist and researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), told Le Monde. Mouhanna feels it leaves too much room for interpretation: ""Police officers are being asked to predict behavior, which is quite dangerous.""A law extended the conditions for the use of firearms by police officers, hastily drafted to appease the anger of police officers and their union representatives following the serious injuries sustained by two officers in Viry-Châtillon (in the Paris region) in October 2016. According to internal police documents consulted by the newspaper Libération in 2022, the General Directorate of the National Police (DGPN) referred to a ""loosening"" and stated that the new law ""strengthens the operational capacity of police officers by enabling them to act more effectively, while enjoying greater legal and physical security.""This analysis converges with pre-publication work by researchers Sébastian Roché (CNRS), Paul Le Derff (University of Lille) and Simon Varaine (University of Grenoble) on police homicides following refusals to comply (from 2011 to 2022). A summary of their research, published in September 2022 in the journal Esprit, looks specifically at the effect of the February 2017 law on the relatively sharp increase in police shootings of moving vehicles since that year.The figures compiled by the researchers show a significant increase in fatal shootings of police officers after the February 2017 law on drivers of moving vehicles: There were around 0.06 deaths per shooting at a vehicle before the reform, compared with around 0.32 since the reform of the domestic security code. The researchers point out that the factors are manifold but believe that the effect of the 2017 law is ""significant"" and that the increase in fatal shootings is not linked to the increase in refusals to obey, which ""had begun to increase before the law, while fatal shootings only increased afterward.""Other factors may come into play, such as the training of police officers, reduced ""from 12 to eight months in June 2020,"" write the researchers, who point to a drop in the level of recruited officers. Now, with police officers needed in numbers during recent and future events (attacks, Yellow Yests, pension reform protests, Olympic Games), there is a ""sacrifice of training time,"" said Christian Mouhanna.""Nearly one candidate in five is now admitted to the ranks of the police, compared with one in 50 a decade ago,"" in order to meet the recruitment targets of 10,000 additional officers set by President Emmanuel Macron in his first term, the three academics note.",/en/les-decodeurs/
"French state excessively 'dependent' on consulting firms, Court of Audit confirms","    A report published Monday notes how the state has been increasingly relying on consultants, including for missions that could be handled by the administration itself. Expenditure on these contracts has soared under Emmanuel Macron's presidency. ","The French state has increasingly spent on contracts with consulting firms while infringing on rules in doing so, the French Court of Audit criticizes in a report published Monday, July 10. ""The state did not put itself in a position to conduct a coherent and controlled policy"" regarding its recourse to these firms, says the report, which is based, among other things, on the audit of a hundred or so contracts from 2019 to 2022. The country's top audit institution broadly confirms the conclusions of the Sénat's commission of inquiry, which had perturbed President Emmanuel Macron's re-election campaign in the spring of 2022. The Court calls on the government to correct its course in the coming years.First, there are the figures. Spending on consulting firms by the French state has risen sharply over the past 10 years: From around €11 million in 2014, expenses rose to €103 million in 2018, then to €200 million in 2022 – and that does not even count IT expenditure.While these sums represent only a ""minimal"" share of public spending – 0.25% of the state's operating budget – the report's authors are not convinced by the government's pretext for this increase in expenditure – namely, the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The investigation reveals that no comprehensive explanation"" was provided for this increase in spending, which was, ""at best, observed,"" but not explicitly decided, anticipated or even explained later on. The blame lies in part with ""mediocre"" budgetary data, which still makes it difficult to accurately monitor these consultancy services. For example, the ministries of education and the environment were ""unable"" to submit to the Court a list of their contracts with consulting firms.The Court of Audit concedes that there may be legitimate reasons for externalizing these services, such as a lack of skills or resources within the state administration. But very often, consultants ""carry out tasks that could or should be carried out – barring exceptional circumstances – by civil servants,"" the report deplores, citing numerous examples.For instance, in 2018, the Education Ministry outsourced the reorganization of the General Directorate for School Education to two consulting firms, EY and Boston Consulting Group, even though this service would ""naturally"" have been the responsibility of the ministry's Inspectorate General, according to the Court of Audit. Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry has externalized the control of automated speed cameras, which accounts for a quarter of its non-IT consulting services, even though these are ""permanent state missions."" Similarly, the Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) has largely increased its use of consulting firms to support the deployment of the post-Covid stimulus plan, of which it is responsible for 25% of credits, even though these are ""heavyweight actions that would require specialists"" within the state.""It is not normal to see consulting firms assume such responsibility,"" said Pierre Moscovici, the president of the Court of Audit.",/en/les-decodeurs/
European Commission validates petition on wealth taxation,    A proposal for an 'environmental and social wealth tax' will need one million signatures from European citizens before the European executive can examine it. ,"A key step has been taken toward the launch of a major political debate at the European level in 2024 on creating a wealth tax targeting the richest 1%. On Tuesday, July 11, the European Commission said it has decided to register the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) by two leading figures in the European Social Democratic camp, Belgian MEP Paul Magnette and French MEP Aurore Lalucq. The initiative is ""aimed at taxing large fortunes in the European Union to finance the energy and social transition.""A little-known instrument of European democracy, the ECI is similar to the French Shared Initiative Referendum. It consists of a massive petition to be submitted to European citizens, potentially leading to the drafting of a European directive proposal or, failing the aforementioned, a political discussion at the European institutional level.The Commission's green light will enable Paul Magnette and Aurore Lalucq to launch a campaign in September to collect, within one year, the one million signatures from European citizens in at least seven countries required to put this European ""environmental and social wealth tax"" on the political agenda. The challenge will require the support of other political groups and NGOs committed to fair taxation and climate change mitigation.There is no guarantee that the initiative will have any political follow-up, even if it is successful. ""The registration decision is legal and does not limit the Commission's final legal and political conclusions on this initiative or the action it intends to take, if any,"" the EC reiterated on Tuesday. Of the 127 ECIs launched since the tool was created in 2012, only eight have resulted in concrete measures proposed by the European executive.According to Lalucq, the prospect of a major European tax reform is still far off, but it is getting closer. ""The issue of taxing the ultra-rich is gaining momentum, and we need to restore fairness to our societies by reconciling taxation and social justice,"" the MEP from Place Publique said. ""If we politicians put the subject on the agenda, it will be good for Europe and the quality of debate, and it's a project that will restore the confidence of citizens.""The MEP also sees the line moving on the legal front. While taxation remains a matter of national jurisdiction and sovereignty, a growing number of member states believe that taking action at the European level is possible. Lalucq believes this is illustrated by ""the EU's adoption in December 2022 of a 15% minimum tax on multinationals and the European agreement of September 2022 to tax corporate superprofits.""",/en/les-decodeurs/
"'Sound of Freedom,' a film about the fight against child sex trafficking, galvanizes conspiracy circles","    Alejandro Monteverde's feature film about child sex trafficking is the surprise hit of the summer. Inspired by real facts, though disputed by specialists, the film is being held up by conspiracists close to QAnon as proof of the existence of a deeper network. ","In the United States, Sound of Freedom is the unexpected hit of the summer so far. On July 4, the American national holiday, Alejandro Monteverde's low-budget thriller had to compete in theaters with Disney's latest blockbuster, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, directed by James Mangold. After grossing $41 million (€37.25 million) in box-office receipts in its first week, the movie was already ranking in 25th place in domestic releases for 2023.This rather dark work of fiction − the movie is about child trafficking − was inspired by real events and has benefited from unexpected word-of-mouth marketing. This was thanks in part to social media and news outlets close to the Trumpist right, which have made the fight against pedophile rings one of their main missions − at the risk of harming the incredibly necessary fight against pedophilia.Sound of Freedom tells the story of Timothy Ballard, a US federal agent who, after rescuing a young Mexican boy from a child trafficking ring, leaves his job to go find and rescue the boy's sister.Ballard, played on screen by Jim Caviezel (The Passion of the Christ, Person of Interest), is a human rights activist known for having founded in 2013 Operation Underground Railroad (OUR), a non-profit organization specializing in infiltrating pedophile networks in Latin America and the Caribbean. The movie, which is fiction rather than a documentary, tells the fictionalized story of his first operation, involving his infiltration of the Colombian cartel in 2013.OUR is a highly popular organization among the American conservative right, and Ballard's self-produced documentary about the organization, Operation Toussaint (2020), has been distributed and promoted in France by the French talk show host Karl Zéro, who is deeply committed to the fight against pedophilia. But OUR is not unanimously supported. Several press investigations have criticized the flattering reports of OUR's operations − with the organization even having ""a long history of false claims,"" according to Vice. Its vigilante methods of alternating between undercover infiltration and forceful intervention have been deemed hasty and vague at times, even ""disturbingly amateurish.""""The trouble is, it’s really risky to the victims,"" wrote Anne Gallagher, founder of the UN ­Inter-Agency Group on Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling, in 2016. Above all, she pointed out the unfortunate fact that their dramatic rescues, filmed on hidden camera, were not accompanied by any follow-up with the victims: ""They’re in and out. No way they can follow up a victim’s case. No way they’re evaluating the impact of what they’ve done.""",/en/les-decodeurs/
"Uber, Deliveroo and other platforms often abuse their workers' independent status","    The work of the Uber Files commission of inquiry has cast doubt on platform workers' 'self-employed' status. Although jurisprudence is moving in to support them, the law still does not recognize them as employees. ","""If they've created jobs in France, I'm really proud of that:"" French President Macron's reaction after the release of the Uber Files revelations about Uber's bad practices, in July 2022. His remark was emblematic of the debate on new labor platforms, which is largely focused on their supposed contribution to the economy.Jobs, yes, but what kind of jobs? For how much? Under what conditions? A decade after the invasion led by Uber and similar platforms, these questions are at the heart of the report by the French Assemblée Nationale's commission of inquiry into ""uberization, its lobbying and consequences,"" which was published on Tuesday, July 18. In particular, this work questions most platforms' refusal to pay their workers a wage, in favor of a more precarious self-employed status. While the mass requalification of these service providers as employees with permanent employment contracts in France does not appear to be on the agenda for the time being, it emerged from the hearings that the ""independent"" status has been largely hijacked by these new economic players.In front of the MPs, all the heads of the platforms concerned – Deliveroo, Getir, StaffMe, Stuart and Uber – attempted to convince them of the relevance of maintaining the self-employed status to their business. ""Every delivery partner can, at any time, choose their errands and their platform,"" said Melvina Sarfati El Grably, managing director of meal delivery company Deliveroo France. Presenting drivers ""as being subject to a relationship of subordination does not reflect the reality on the ground,"" said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber CEO, as ""couriers and drivers can continue to be their own boss, to have room to maneuver, flexibility [and] independence.""But these arguments, which have been deployed for many years, were challenged on March 15 by three magistrates from the social chamber of the Cour de Cassation, France's highest court of appeals. At their hearing, they asserted that several common platform practices – deactivating an account, choosing working hours, geolocation and imposing itineraries and rates – could contribute to characterizing a wage-earning relationship under French and European law. And the Cour de Cassation has handed down several landmark rulings in this regard in recent years:",/en/les-decodeurs/
The economic woes of Uber-like platforms,"    Following in Uber's footsteps, Deliveroo, Getir and other companies based on the same principles were supposed to revolutionize the economy. But the number of bankruptcies has multiplied in recent months, proving that the model is not that clear-cut. ","On July 12, 2022, when questioned by journalists about the revelations of the Uber Files, which showed the extent to which the French president had supported the development of Uber in France, Emmanuel Macron said that he ""stand[s] by it."" ""I for one am extremely proud [to have helped create jobs],"" said Macron. ""It's very difficult to create jobs without businesses and entrepreneurs.""In response to this argument, critics of Uber and other companies based on the same model often reply: ""Sure, but what kind of jobs?"" The independent contractor jobs created by Uber, Deliveroo or similar home delivery services, the number of which is difficult to assess, are often precarious, poorly paid and part-time. A year after the Uber Files were leaked, one could also ask: ""What kind of companies?"" Over the past year, there has been a mass movement of buyouts, closures and bankruptcies in almost every ""uberized"" sector.In ""quick commerce"" and home shopping delivery, the chain of events has been brutal: In two years, the sector went from 10 players to one – and then zero. Despite being backed by massive fundraising, home delivery platforms and their dark stores (fully stocked stores that are only for online sales) in major cities have never been profitable in France. The company Gorillas, which was valued at over €1 billion euros two years ago, absorbed France's Frichti a year ago and then was quickly bought out by Getir at the end of 2022. The consolidation, which put an end to fierce coupon-driven competition between the rival apps, did not make the model any more viable. In fact, Getir announced on June 21 that it would be leaving France at the end of July.In the meal delivery sector, the picture is a little better, but hardly more stable. On June 15, Uber Eats, despite growing worldwide, suddenly announced its complete withdrawal from Italy and Israel, due to insufficient profitability in these markets. Fifty employees and thousands of delivery drivers were left out in the cold in Italy. Deliveroo, one of its main rivals, announced that it was laying off almost 10% of its salaried workforce worldwide due to poor economic conditions. In both France and Italy, the two companies have also been involved in legal proceedings revolving around undeclared work, dating back to the late 2010s, and are still struggling to resolve the situation of the – many – undocumented delivery drivers working for them.A comparative analysis of fundraising and valuations leaves little room for doubt. With the exception of national companies that have established themselves in a niche where competition is weaker (Blablacar, Lyveat), the surviving companies are the ones that have raised enormous sums enabling them to crush any competitors by subsidizing their services, even at a loss if need be.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Donald Trump: The main investigations threatening the former US president,In Depth,"Former US president Donald Trump is facing four criminal indictments, all filed since March and raising the prospect that the Republican frontrunner in the 2024 White House race could end up navigating a series of trials as he campaigns.Here are the key cases involving the former president.These are the most serious charges brought against the former head of state. Trump was formally served with his indictment in federal court in Washington on Thursday, August 3. The former president pleaded not guilty on all counts.Special Counsel Jack Smith, who has been leading the investigation since November 2022, has already revealed that the grand jury (a panel of 23 citizens, 12 of whom are enough to decide on an indictment), which has been meeting for several months in Washington, had approved four charges against the former president:The 45-page indictment follows the report of the House Committee on the December 2022 Capitol Hill assault, which called for criminal charges to be brought against the former president after an 18-month investigation and more than 1,000 witnesses interviewed. The grand jury was able to hear witnesses who had refused to appear before the congressional committee, such as former vice president Mike Pence and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.The prosecution's evidence shows that Trump was aware that he had lost the election and that the appeals had no legal basis. In particular, he had criticized Pence for being ""too honest"" and tried to make him believe that ""major [electoral] infractions"" had been uncovered by the Justice Department.The investigation showed that when Trump failed to persuade federal officials to fraudulently swing the election in his favor, he and his team began creating fake lists of electors in certain key states, trying to force them on state legislatures so they would be transmitted to Congress for certification. These certificates were ultimately ignored by legislators. But if this scheme had succeeded, the Republican candidate could have retained the White House at Biden's expense.The indictment also accuses him of having ""exploited"" the violence and chaos on Capitol Hill on the afternoon of January 6, 2021, to continue trying to convince lawmakers to postpone the certification of the November 2020 vote.The Capitol investigation has already resulted in the criminal prosecution of nearly 1,000 rioters, with the first convictions handed down on November 30, 2022. Members of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia, were convicted of sedition.With less than six months to go before the start of the Republican primary, for which Trump remains the overwhelming favorite, Special Counsel Smith said he wanted to achieve a ""speedy trial.""When Trump left the White House in January 2021, he took with him entire boxes of documents. Under a 1978 law, all US presidents are required to transfer all emails, letters and other working papers to the National Archives.The following spring, the archives noticed that certain documents were missing and asked Trump to return them. This request went unheeded until January 2022, when the former president finally returned 15 boxes. On receiving these boxes, which included 184 classified documents, the archives asked the US Department of Justice to open an investigation.In May 2022, the Justice Department officially requested the return of all government documents. After several witness hearings, the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that the ex-president was probably keeping other documents in his luxurious residence at Mar-a-Lago, Florida.In June 2022, his lawyers submitted a second batch of documents to the Justice Department, claiming that there were no more. But evidence obtained by federal investigators, including video surveillance footage of the villa, justified a search of Trump's home on August 8, 2022. The FBI seized an additional 33 boxes containing more than 11,000 government documents, 103 of which were classified; 18 were even classified as top secret. The search warrant cited a potential violation of the Espionage Act of 1917 – which prohibits the collection of national security information that could harm the US.According to Special Counsel Jack Smith, in charge of the investigation, boxes were scattered at Mar-a-Lago in various locations, including a ballroom, a bathroom and shower, an office space, his bedroom and a storage space. The Mar-a-Lago investigators claim that the obstruction was repeated and characterized by Trump suggesting to one of his lawyers that he did not possess the documents requested by the investigators. Trump and two of his assistants (Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira) are also accused of having asked an employee at his residence to delete video surveillance images from the Mar-a-Lago Club to prevent these images from being handed over to the courts.On June 13, Trump appeared before a judge in Miami, Florida, to be served with 37 charges – including unlawful withholding of national security information, obstruction of justice and perjury – some of which carry a 10- or 20-year prison sentence. This was the first time that a former US president had been indicted at the federal level. Three new charges were later added to the indictment for the attempted deletion of surveillance footage. The billionaire chose to plead not guilty.The trial date was set for May 20, 2024, just two months before the Republican nomination convention, for which Trump is a favorite. But the three new later charges could delay the proceedings.Trump was formally charged on Tuesday, April 4, by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg with ""orchestrating"" a series of payments to cover up three embarrassing affairs before the 2016 election. He faces 34 charges.The prosecutor detailed the alleged payments made by the former US president: a Trump Tower doorman, who claimed to have information about a child out of wedlock, received $30,000 to keep quiet; a woman who presented herself as a former mistress received $150,000 to keep a low profile; and finally a porn actress, presumably Stormy Daniels, received $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged extramarital affair.Trump pleaded not guilty. After his appearance, the former president walked out of court free. The trial date has been set for March 25, 2024, but the prosecutor has hinted that he is prepared to alter his timetable to give priority to a federal trial in another case.Opened in August 2018 by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., and taken over since the summer of 2022 by his successor, Alvin Bragg, the investigation sought, among other things, to determine whether the former Republican president had been guilty of making a false statement, a misdemeanor offense, and above all of failing to comply with campaign finance laws, a criminal offense, by having omitted from his campaign expenses a payment of $130,000 (€120,000) to Stormy Daniels in 2016.The scandal really emerged when the Wall Street Journal revealed, in early 2018, that the billionaire had bought the silence of Stephanie Clifford – Stormy Daniels' real name – by entering into a confidential agreement accompanied by a bank transfer of $130,000, executed on October 26, 2016, by his lawyer and then confidant Michael Cohen. The arrangement called for Clifford to keep quiet about an alleged sexual relationship she had with Trump in 2006, when he had been married to Melania Trump for a year. Trump has always denied the affair.The investigation accelerated on October 21, 2018, when Cohen admitted to arranging the payment for Trump. The former president had initially denied any knowledge of the payment, before admitting that he had reimbursed his lawyer for it, describing it as a ""simple private transaction."" However, if the agreement with Stormy Daniels was indeed authorized, it could have been a campaign expense. However, the sum does not appear in the candidate's 2016 accounts but was listed as ""legal fees"" in the Trump Organization's documents. Cohen, who has since pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws and spent more than a year in prison, is now a central witness.Donald Trump was indicted for the fourth time on August 14 by a Georgia grand jury in Atlanta's Fulton County for attempting to reverse the 2020 presidential election in this swing state. Trump was indicted on 13 counts, along with 18 other people, including his advisor, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and a Justice Department official under his administration, Jeffrey Clark. A total of 41 different charges have been brought against the 19 defendants, including ""false statements and documents, usurpation of public office, forgery and use of forgeries,"" witness tampering, a series of computer crimes and perjury.Fani Willis, the district attorney for Fulton County, Georgia, had opened a criminal investigation on February 10, 2021, to determine whether Trump attempted to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the election results in his favor in this key state. On January 2, 2021, during a conference call disclosed by the media, Trump told Raffensperger: ""I just want to find 11,780 votes,"" which was the number of ballots he needed to win over the state.The call came after all of the Trump team's legal appeals to the courts failed, with multiple audits and recounts showing no evidence of massive voter fraud. It also followed multiple calls to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp in November and December 2020, as well as public demands on Raffensperger, threats of political retribution, public criticism and calls for Governor Kemp's resignation.",/en/les-decodeurs/
The Mediterranean on fire and a rainy Paris: The reasons for France's weird summer,"    For the past three weeks, part of France has had dismal weather. This can be explained by a shift in the jet stream, but it does not call into question the reality of climate change. ","The planet is burning, but most French people are wearing a light sweater: This is the paradox of summer in 2023. July was marked by scorching temperatures around the Mediterranean and spectacular fires in Sicily and Greece, prompting the UN to declare the start of ""the era of global boiling,"" while at the same time, gloomy, rainy weather descended over the northern half of the country.Unsettling? Yes, if conversations in everyday life are anything to go by. On social media, some climate change skeptics have even seized on the paradoxical weather, making jokes about what some are calling an ""asymptomatic heatwave."" And yet the current situation does not contradict the science and nor does it minimize the seriousness of the situation. Here's why:Because of the jet stream. This ""wind tube,"" as France's national weather forecaster Météo-France calls it, crosses the globe from west to east in the upper atmosphere, bringing wind and precipitation. It usually moves over Scandinavia in summer, but not this year. ""It is currently located over the north of France, which explains why temperatures are cooler,"" explained François Gourand, forecaster at Météo-France.As a result, the mercury plummeted during the second half of July, with France largely protected by the low-pressure veil. However, France's situation is unique: In contrast, July 2023 was the hottest month on record worldwide.Back in June, scientists were worrying about a scorching summer, not least because of the El Niño phenomenon. This powerful high-pressure system, responsible for some of the hottest years on record, was set to add to the steady rise in summer temperatures. But the fundamental dynamics of climate, which are established over the long term, can be blurred by numerous short-term meteorological phenomena, which are linked to atmospheric air and wind flows: This is the difference between climate and weather.The shift in the jet stream was ""not really anticipated,"" admitted Gourand, and ""it is part of the variability of weather."" It is expected to move northwards across Europe from the second week of August, leading to a return to seasonal norms across France.It's too early to say: For that, complex attribution studies would be needed, and the phenomenon would have to be repeated over several summers. That's the problem we're currently facing when it comes to studying the climate: Without the benefit of hindsight, it's difficult to tell the difference between short-term meteorological phenomena and new climatic phenomena.In any case, the idea that the jet stream is influenced by climate disruption cannot be ruled out, since it moves according to changes in pressure and temperature contrasts. A study by the University of Pennsylvania showed in 2022 that climate disruption was causing a change in its behavior, which has accentuated its propensity to change latitude. This is what is happening this summer.""France lies between the Mediterranean, hit by a heat dome of exceptional magnitude, and northern Europe, which is subject to low-pressure conditions,"" explained Gourand. ""The heat has probably accentuated the contrast, which feeds the famous jet stream.""No. Firstly, because if you move away from the north of France, temperatures were (very) high in the south. In July,  Météo-France reported that Corsica experienced its second longest heatwave since 1947. Furthermore, several records were set in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and Pyrénées-Occidentales, with readings of 39.2oC in Cannes on July 19, and 40.4oC in Serralongue. ""The month of July is the 15th hottest since 1900 for France as a whole,"" pointed out climatologist Christine Berne in the French daily Libération.June had already ranked as the second hottest month over the 1900-2023 period, according to Météo-France records. And while France is unlikely to experience a heatwave between now and August 15, temperatures are expected to rise again after that.No, on the contrary. In all forecasting models, rain does not disappear, but falls differently, more sparsely and more intensely. ""In regions like France, the total amount of precipitation will fluctuate little,"" confirmed CNRS researcher Julie Deshayes. ""But it's the concentration of precipitation in a smaller window of time that changes: What we had over a month before, now we'll have over two days. This, too, is an indicator of climate change.""As a result, the northern half of France – for example in the Doubs – was hit by violent thunderstorms and torrential rain. ""We think that as soon as there's no more heat wave, there's no global warming , but that's not how it works,"" said Deshayes. In reality, global warming is accompanied by more general disruption, which takes the form of extreme episodes, both in one direction (heat waves, drought) and the other (cold snaps, storms, torrential rain). In Beijing, a record amount of rain fell in three days at the end of July, leaving dozens dead and missing.Conversely, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Tunisia and Algeria experienced extreme temperatures in the second half of July, with peaks of 48.2oC in Jerzu (Sardinia), 47.8oC in Syracuse (Sicily), 48.7oC in Algiers, 49oC in Tunis, and there were fires in Croatia, Portugal and Bulgaria.It's true that hot summers are expected in this part of the world, and very high temperatures have already been recorded in isolated cases. ""But the fact that they are occurring with increasing frequency and amplitude is characteristic of climate change,"" said Deshayes, who sees in them ""a glimpse of the climate of the future,"" with increasingly intense and frequent heat waves.The heat dome that marked the month of July around the Mediterranean took forecasters by surprise. ""If we look at the heat waves in southern Europe, whose duration and intensity is shaping up to be exceptional, we're looking at an event that we would expect to happen more around 2050,"" climatologist Davide Faranda recently told Le Monde.Not local weather, which is by definition changeable. Many short-term phenomena mask long-term upheavals. One indicator that seems to provide indisputable proof of global warming is ocean temperatures. This is because the oceans capture a large proportion of atmospheric heat, and unlike air, they are less changeable, less exposed to contradictory atmospheric dynamics, and retain this heat for longer. ""This makes them a better indicator of global warming,"" said Deshayes. At the end of July, the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic broke all-time records.",/en/les-decodeurs/
From a critical injury in Marseille to officer walkouts: A chronology of the crisis in France's police,"    A young man was hospitalized in Marseille earlier this month after he was allegedly beaten by police officers. Three weeks later, the case sparked a nationwide crisis involving police officers, magistrates, and politicians. ","From July 2 to 25, alleged violence against a young man in Marseille led to a crisis with the French police. From events in France's second-largest city to walkouts at police stations, Le Monde looks back at how things unfolded.As riots raged across France in reaction to the death of Nahel M., a 17-year-old shot dead by a police officer during a traffic stop in Nanterre, west of Paris, on June 29, the situation is particularly agitated in Marseille's city center.On the night of Sunday, July 2, a 22-year-old man is shot in the temple with a rubber-bullet launcher. He is then allegedly beaten up by up to five police officers. The victim later identified the officers as belonging to an anti-crime squad. The incident will be made public many days later.At this point, there still has been no publicity about the incident. While the young man, Hedi, remains hospitalized, the Marseille public prosecutor's office says a judicial investigation is being opened over ""violence in a group by a person in a position of public authority"" resulting in work incapacity ""of more than eight days.""The public prosecutor's office has referred the case to the Marseille regional criminal investigation department (Direction Territoriale de la Police Judiciaire de Marseille) and the Inspectorate General of National Police (IGPN), an internal unit investigating police misconduct.The young man, aged 21 at the time of the alleged events, is an assistant manager in the catering sector. In the local daily newspaper La Provence, he recounts going out after his shift ""finished around 1:30 am"" with a close friend, Lillian. As they reach Marseille's Old Port area, they come across ""four or five men"" plain-clothes officers with ""a gun in their belt and a Flash-Ball around their neck.""According to Lilian: ""When they asked us what we were doing here, one of them had his gun in his hand, his finger on the trigger, and another unfolded his truncheon. I don't think we even had time to respond. I blocked one of the blows with my arm, and we turned to run away. Then I heard a shot.""Hedi says: ""They pulled me by my clothes and dragged me into an alley; they put me on my back, and one put his knees on my legs to block them. I was trying to protect myself, but I could feel the blood running from my head, I thought I still had the bullet in me.""Eight police officers from two anti-crime units are detained on IGPN premises. After 48 hours in custody, four police officers still being questioned leave the IGPN to the applause of their colleagues.The four police officers are charged with ""violence in a group by a person in a position of public authority"" resulting in work incapacity ""of more than eight days."" Three are under judicial supervision with a ""ban on exercising their professional activity as police officers."" The fourth is remanded in custody, becoming the second police officer in three weeks to be jailed pending trial, after the one suspected of having shot Nahel M., an unusual situation in France.The same day, dozens of civil servants gather in front of a Marseille courthouse to support their colleagues.Police officers do not have the right to strike. Nevertheless, many police officers in Marseille have been prescribed sick leave. Others cite the ""code 562"": A form of minimum service restricted to emergency missions at the expense of patrols and hearings of victims, suspects, and witnesses.In an interview with daily Le Parisien, Frédéric Veaux, the director general of the French national police (DGPN), Frédéric Veaux, praises the action of his men during the riots, who ""in this situation close to chaos, showed physical and moral courage, and total commitment.""Another section of the interview sparked vivid controversy:""I believe that before a possible trial, a police officer has no place in prison, even if he or she may have committed faults or serious errors in the course of his or her work. I'm not talking about cases involving probity or honesty. But when a police officer is in the line of duty, it must be admitted that he or she may make errors of judgment. Police officers must be accountable for their actions, including in court, but we must also take into account the guarantees they enjoy, which distinguish them from criminals or thugs. I repeat, in this type of case, committal to prison is not the solution.""""I share the DGPN's comments,"" Laurent Nuñez, Paris police prefect, adds on Twitter.The allies of French President Emmanuel Macron in parliament and the government have remained remarkably quiet, starting with Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin who has not said a word on the case.The left-wing opposition, meanwhile, decries ""the entire police hierarchy placing itself above the law"" (Olivier Faure, first secretary of the Parti Socialiste), warned that ""what is at stake here is democracy and respect for the rule of law"" (Ugo Bernalicis, an MP with La France Insoumise, radical left).Magistrates are also concerned with Veaux's comments, as expressed by Cécile Mamelin, vice-president of the Union Syndicale des Magistrats (Magistrates union):""Our union has always expressed its support for the police, as they operate in extremely difficult and violent conditions. But to know nothing about the substance of a case and to speak out unreservedly, when legal recourse exists for police officers as for any other citizen, is tantamount to undermining the very foundations of the rule of law.""The French president is the guest of France's 1 pm news programs on France 2 and TF1 televisions. He did not speak publically on July 14, as presidents usually do for Bastille Day, and after a July 20 reshuffle. When asked about Veaux's comments that day, Macron declines to comment on the remarks.""I'm not going to comment on what the director general [Veaux] has said, because I'm the guarantor of institutions and the independence of the judiciary. It's a decision taken by a magistrate, so I'm not going to comment on it. In our country, police officers are there to ensure that the law is properly enforced and that the republican order is maintained. The rule of law presupposes the presumption of innocence for everyone, and respect for the law for everyone.""""But our police officers and gendarmes were present during those nights in the face of an unprecedented outpouring of violence, 900 of them were injured during those nights and there are 28 investigations by the IGPN and IGGN [Inspectorate General of National Gendarmes]. We need to put things in their proper place, and be absolutely inflexible when there are excesses, when ethics are not respected. Everyone must respect the law. But I wouldn't want us to get into the wrong kind of debate, and I understand the emotion of our police officers who felt they were confronted with the most extreme violence. We must listen to this emotion, while upholding the rule of law for all. They themselves operate within the framework of the law and the rule of law. No one in the Republic is above the law.""Resorting to sick leave or ""code 562,"" police officers keep expressing their discontent, and the anger has spread, first to France's southeast, then to the Paris region. On a visit to New Caledonia with Macron, Darmanin remains tight-lipped.French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne insists on ""the need for justice to be able to do its job serenely,"" denying any disagreement with the interior minister and the president. According to Borne: ""Everyone is saying the same thing.""In an interview with Konbini, Hedi told his account of the evening of July 1, and spoke of the serious consequences he has suffered: Three operations, a coma, a deformed skull, weight loss of around 10 kilos, recurring migraines, ""blurred"" vision in his left eye, and having to wear a helmet to protect his head in the event of a fall. The young man has a deformed skull due to surgery that ""removed a piece of skull so that it can 'breathe'. As long as it doesn't deflate, they [the doctors] can't put my [cranial] flap back on."" He said that no police officer or member of the government had contacted him.BFM-TV reported two of the four officers questioned by the IGPN in connection with their charges admitted to violence. As for the police officer remanded in custody, he was the only one carrying a rubber bullet launcher, according to CCTV footage. Identified thanks to his T-shirt, he said he remembers nothing, saw nothing and did not recognize himself in the footage, reported the news channel. Le Monde learned that Hedi's friend who was with him that evening recognized the police officers involved.Prior to his meeting with the police unions, Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin – who had remained silent until then, despite the police anger – visited a Paris police station in the 19th arrondissement, accompanied by the Paris police prefect, Nuñez, and the head of the national police force, Veaux.Darmanin described Veaux as ""a great policeman, a great cop (...) I totally support him."" He also defended the police officers who have been ""insulted and vilified,"" he said. ""Added to this fatigue is an emotion, an anger, and for many of them (...) a sadness at these [accusations], these media trials"", said the minister. ""I understand this emotion, I understand this anger, and I understand this sadness.""In the evening, the unions put forward several proposals. The minister said he was taking three of them into consideration, including the one calling for a special pre-trial detention regime for civil servants.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Google's trial comes as critical test for US regulators,"The Department of Justice is accusing the search engine of preserving its monopoly through exclusive contracts. But the supervision of Big Tech, Big Pharma and Big Oil is a delicate matter, with Washington also aiming for an industrial rearmament in the face of China.","A quarter of a century after trying to dismantle Microsoft, United States antitrust authorities are taking on Google. A trial begins in Washington DC on Tuesday, September 12, which could signal the culmination of an offensive against Big Tech launched under former US president Donald Trump and continued by his successor Joe Biden.Google handles around 90% of the world's search engine queries, and the Department of Justice is accusing it of maintaining a monopoly ""through exclusionary agreements with distributors"" that make Google the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser and Mozilla's Firefox. The same argument was used against Microsoft, which used exclusivity contracts to promote Internet Explorer and eliminate Netscape.Yet nobody believes a trial will change the game fundamentally. Investors keep buying shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company. Since the beginning of the year, Alphabet is up 50%. The judge presiding over the trial, Amit Mehta, dismissed lawsuits brought jointly by 38 states, Republican and Democrat, over Google's advertising practices and focused the case on the search engine alone. A series of setbacks suffered by the federal government, unable to convince judges to sanction Big Tech firms, also serves as a reminder that regulating Google will prove arduous.The authorities' stance toward Google is embodied by Lina Khan, chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, which shares with the DOJ the task of implementing Biden's antitrust approach. The 34-year-old made a name for herself in 2017 with an article explaining that just because Amazon kept prices low for consumers did not mean it was not abusing its position to the detriment of other sellers listed on its platform. Once appointed, she stepped up her antitrust attacks, accentuating the anti-tech backlash begun under Trump, a crusade that ended in emblematic failures. ""Are you losing on purpose?"" Kevin Riley, representative for California's 3rd congressional district, asked Khan in a congressional hearing in July.Khan lost her case against Microsoft, which she wanted to prevent from acquiring online gaming specialist Activision for $70 billion. A judge ruled that she had failed to prove that the takeover would reduce competition and harm consumers. The lesson here is that judges do not like to punish vertical integrations. Previously, under the Trump administration, antitrust authorities had been unable to block AT&T's takeover of Time Warner. However, this did not prevent the operation from turning into a disaster.",/en/pixels/
France orders Apple iPhone 12 sales halted over high radiation levels,    The French agency that regulates radio frequencies said Tuesday that testing found that the model emits more electromagnetic waves susceptible to be absorbed by the body than permitted. ,"French regulators on Tuesday, September 12, ordered Apple to halt sales of the iPhone 12 for emitting too much electromagnetic radiation, and to fix existing handsets. The French agency that regulates radio frequencies, the ANFR, said testing found that the model emits more electromagnetic waves susceptible to be absorbed by the body than permitted.The ANFR said it ""ordered Apple to remove the iPhone 12 from the French market from September 12 due to the model exceeding the limit"" for electromagnetic absorption by the body. It said accredited labs had found absorption of electromagnetic energy by the body at 5.74 watts per kilogram during tests simulating when the phone was being held in the hand or kept in a pocket.The European standard is a specific absorption rate of 4.0 watts per kilogram in such tests. ""Concerning phones already sold, Apple must in the briefest of delays take corrective measures to bring the affected phones into compliance,"" said the ANFR in a statement on its website. ""Otherwise, Apple will have to recall them.""ANFR noted that tests that measure the electromagnetic radiation absorbed at a distance of five centimetres was in compliance with the limit of 2.0 watts per kilogram. ANFR said its agents would verify beginning on Wednesday that iPhone 12 models were no longer being offered for sale in France.When contacted by Agence France-Presse (AFP), Apple disputed the ANFR's results, saying it had presented multiple independent analyses showing the devices were in compliance, but that the company would nonetheless continue to work with the regulator.Regulators in a number of countries have limits on the amount of electromagnetic radiation mobile phones may emit to prevent adverse health effects. The World Health Organization states on its website that following a large number of studies that ""no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use"".The news from France came the same day that Apple unveiled its new iPhone 15 lineup, the first to feature a universal charging port in place of its unique ""Lightning"" ports after a tussle with European regulators.The EU is insisting that all phones and other small devices must be compatible with the USB-C charging cables from the end of next year, a move it says will reduce waste and save money for consumers.""USB-C has become a universally accepted standard. So we're bringing USB-C to iPhone 15,"" said Kaiann Drance, Apple's vice president of iPhone marketing at a launch event.The update comes as the Silicon Valley tech giant faces declining iPhone sales, as premium prices push customers to delay switching to newer models.""Apple needed to deliver more than just minor updates to get people excited about buying new products,"" Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart said in a demo area at the event. ""I think they delivered on that with lots of updates, some of them not so minor.""",/en/pixels/
TikTok fined €345 million for violating children's privacy,"    The investigation, opened in 2021 by Ireland's privacy regulator, accuses the platform of two things, including making all newly created profiles public by default. ","The Data Protection Commission (DPC), Ireland's privacy regulator, announced in a press release on Friday, September 15, that it had imposed a €345 million penalty on TikTok. To date, this is the largest fine imposed in Europe against the Chinese social media platform.The DPC criticized TikTok for two things:The social media platform has three months to comply with the two issues, according to the institution.This record fine is the result of an investigation opened in September 2021 by the DPC and covering a period from July to December 2020. It has been the subject of much wrangling, with some other European data protection agencies challenging a preliminary decision by their Irish counterpart. The case was finally settled by the European Data Protection Committee, the umbrella body for the various European authorities, which forced the DPC to add an additional infringement.In France, TikTok was already fined €5 million in January for the way it handled cookies on its website. While the social media platform ""did indeed offer a button enabling immediate acceptance of cookies,"" it did not provide ""an equivalent solution (button or other) to enable the web user to refuse them as easily,"" explained the CNIL (Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés, France's privacy regulator) at the time in its deliberation.",/en/pixels/
France bans sale of iPhone 12: Here's what to know,"    According to the French National Frequencies Agency, the device generates radiation levels that exceed European standards. Apple has two weeks to come up with an update to solve the problem. ","In a press release published on Tuesday, September 12, the French National Frequencies Agency (ANFR) called on retailers and online stores to temporarily suspend sales of the iPhone 12. According to the agency, the Apple device generates radiation levels that exceed current European standardsLike other smartphones, this device can detect the immediate proximity of the human body thanks to its motion and proximity sensors. This allows it to reduce wave emissions and, theoretically, to pass ANFR tests seamlessly. However, according to the agency, this system is not entirely reliable: ""We have found that the iPhone 12 does not always detect the immediate presence of the body, said ANFR CEO Gilles Brégant when contacted on Wednesday by Le Monde. ""This is the root of the problem.""Apple told Agence France-Presse that it disputes the agency's conclusions. The manufacturer claims to have provided independent third-party laboratory studies proving that its devices comply with the standards. The brand nevertheless says it will continue its discussions with the authorities.""We have no evidence to suggest otherwise,"" said Brégant. ANFR, which regularly checks emissions from different smartphone models, sampled iPhone 12 devices in stores from November 2021 – just over a year after its release in October 2020 – before carrying out its tests a few months later.It found that the limit values for electromagnetic waves emitted and absorbed by the human body had been exceeded. Since then, the problem has not been corrected, and therefore it is likely that all iPhone 12s are affected, with the exception of iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 pro, for which tests have not revealed excessive radiation.As part of its study, ANFR commissioned two types of tests from the German laboratory Cetecom Advanced. The first test involves measuring wave absorption by the human torso. This scenario corresponds to carrying a cell phone in a bag or suit, i.e. at a distance of 5 millimeters from the body. These tests did not reveal that the thresholds authorized in Europe were exceeded.The second test, on the other hand, which measures absorption by the limbs (legs, arms, hands...), revealed values exceeding the set limits. This test measures, for example, wave emissions toward the hand holding the smartphone, or the thigh against which it is pressed when placed in a pocket. The specific absorption rate (SAR), expressed in watts per kilogram, came to 5.74 W/kg, while the maximum authorized threshold is 4 W/kg.Below this threshold, according to the French National Health and Safety Agency (ANSES), there are no adverse health effects. With a peak observed at 5.74, the risks remain minimal, according to Jean-Noël Barrot, minister for digital transition and telecommunications, who was quoted in the newspaper Le Parisien on Tuesday as saying that this 44% overshoot was ""very slight."" This risk is all the more limited keeping in mind that tests in the European Union, as ANSES pointed out, are carried out on phones that are pushed to their maximum power for the duration of the test, which does not correspond to their actual use.If Apple corrects this problem within a few weeks, the excess should have no noticeable effect on health. ""It's not a serious and immediate risk,"" said Brégant. But if the Apple brand refuses, the most cautious users may think about changing their cell phone. Given the impossibility, for the time being, of verifying the total absence of health effects, ANSES recommended using phones that emit lower radiation and reducing children's exposure.Issues with radiation exceeding the threshold can usually be resolved remotely by the manufacturer, with a simple software update. This operation is very easy for users, and most iPhone owners do this on a regular basis. In the case of iPhone 12, however, this update may be tricky to get right, since it is linked to its ability to automatically detect human proximity.According to Minister Barrot, the rules are the same for everyone, including Big Tech. ANFR, for its part, said that ""the tests are the same for everyone"" and that they ""are standardized and reproducible.""Manufacturers generally take breaches of emission limits seriously. Over the past three years, some 20 smartphones found in violation in France have received corrective updates, notably from Samsung, Motorola, Xiaomi and Sony. These corrections often are made in less than a year.With Apple, however, ""the exchanges dragged on for an unusually long time. For the moment, Apple has still not given us any indication of how it intends to solve the problem,"" said ANFR. Was it this situation that prompted the agency to publicly announce the halting of iPhone 12 distribution on Tuesday, right in the middle of Apple's conference announcing the iPhone 15? ""The timing is purely coincidental,"" said Brégant.If Apple fails to take action within the next two weeks, ANFR could go so far as to require the recall of all iPhone 12s on the French market. ""Consumers could then be compensated with a refund or voucher,"" ANFR explained. ""We have already done this for other brands in the past. But we are confident it will not come to that.""",/en/pixels/
Apple to update iPhone 12 in France over radiation,    France had ordered a halt to sales of the device after regulators raised concerns over the amount of electromagnetic radiation emitted. ,"Apple said on Friday, September 15, that it would update the iPhone 12 in France after regulators raised concerns over electromagnetic radiation emitted by the devices.France had ordered a halt to sales of the device, released in 2020, on Tuesday after finding that the model emitted more electromagnetic waves than permitted.""Apple has assured me that it will implement an update for the iPhone 12 in the next few days,"" said France's minister for digital transition and telecommunications, Jean-Noel Barrot, in a statement to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Both the firm and Barrot insisted there was no danger to public health from the radiation.""This is related to a specific testing protocol used by French regulators and not a safety concern,"" Apple said in a statement, adding that the device complied with rules on emissions all around the world. ""We will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators.""The US tech giant had been given two weeks to issue an update to its phone, which was coming to the end of its career as a front-line Apple product. Barrot said the agency in charge of testing, the French National Frequencies Agency (ANFR), would quickly assess the update and decide whether to lift the ban on sales.The World Health Organization points out that several studies in the field have failed to find adverse health effects caused by mobile phone use. And there are no specific illnesses linked to such radiation. But exposure to more than 40 watts per kilogram (W/kg) of electromagnetic radiation does increase body temperature. European regulations allow only 4 W/kg for such devices and the iPhone 12 exceeded that level by 1.7 W/kg.Apple has endured an unusually tough week. Its launch of new products was overshadowed by an announcement that it was replacing its proprietary ""lightning"" charging ports with standard USB-C ports on the latest generation of iPhones, a measure demanded by EU regulators.And Chinese officials denied claims that they had banned iPhones in government buildings before taking a swipe at the firm. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said officials were following ""many recent media reports exposing security incidents relating to Apple mobile phones.""",/en/pixels/
"'Elon Musk,' a biography of the multibillionaire and his demons",Review,"The main revelation in the book Elon Musk, biography of the multi-billionaire boss of Tesla, Space X, and Twitter (turned X), was that the businessman allegedly unexpectedly blocked a major offensive by the Ukrainian army against the Russian fleet by cutting off access to his Starlink service, which Ukrainian drones use to connect to the internet. But even before the book's release on September 12 in the US and September 13 in the rest of the world, this scoop was being disputed by stakeholders. And Walter Isaacson, the biographer, was forced to specify that Starlink was not activated in Crimea at the time and that Elon Musk, rather than interrupting an attack that had already been launched, had simply refused to extend the service in the region for fear of escalating the conflict.This inaccuracy largely disrupted the launch of one of the most eagerly awaited non-fiction books of the year. Isaacson, best known for his previous 2011 biography of Steve Jobs, was able to follow Musk for almost two years, until the beginning of 2023, giving him a behind-the-scenes look at dozens of key moments in his subject's life: The twitter takeover, the Starship rocket explosion and the birth of several of his children. The multi-billionaire, who did not read the book before publication, also invited all those closest to him to speak at length with his biographer, giving him access to a gigantic quantity of anecdotes, personal recollections and stories that had never before been told, at least not at this level of detail.The whole thing makes for fascinating read, not so much for its ""great revelations"" – there are, after all, quite few of them – as for the color it brings to Musk's character. It's a resolutely dark hue: Tesla's founder comes across as a visionary and courageous engineer, but above all as a detestable human being.In 600 pages, Isaacson recounts the details of multiple tantrums, brutal dismissals of employees whose only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and humiliations inflicted on employees and members of his own family. In 2018, when the restaurant chain owned by his brother Kimbal, a historic business partner and one of his closest supporters, was in trouble, he initially refused a loan. ""I had my finance guy look at it, and the restaurants are struggling. I think they should die,"" he told his brother.This ""demon mode,"" described by his partner, the singer Grimes, as the moments ""when he goes dark and retreats inside the storm in his brain,"" is what Isaacson was looking for in both Musk's past and his psychology. There's his violent, manipulative father, with whom he undoubtedly shares more personality traits than he would like, his repeated beatings at school in South Africa and then there's his very different way of thinking, his taste for excessive risk-taking, his need to generate danger when things are too calm, his lack of empathy. Is it Asperger syndrome, as Musk himself claims? Bipolarity, as several members of his entourage believe? Musk, who happily sleeps under his desk when he's dealing with a crisis – which is very often – is not easily put on the couch.",/en/pixels/
French data protection chief: 'We believe in the growth of French and European AI operators',    The president of the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties talks to Le Monde about the implementation of GDPR in France and the question of AI. ,"When she took charge of the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties (CNIL) in 2019, Marie-Laure Denis's main task was to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). With her first term of office drawing to a close in February 2024, the president of the regulatory authority takes stock in an interview with Le Monde and looks back on a year that has seen the introduction of numerous legislative texts on digital matters, both at the national and European level.Marie-Laure Denis: The GDPR has streamlined national data protection regulations. It has increased sanctions to up to 4% of a company's global turnover. Decision-makers are now more concerned with the issue of using personal data, and individuals have become increasingly aware of how it is used. For example, the number of complaints we receive has doubled every year or so since the regulation was implemented. What's more, the GDPR has, to some extent, enabled the European model to be exported. There are now dozens of roughly identical legislations around the world.The €1.2 billion fine imposed by the European Union on Meta or, again very recently, the €345 million fine imposed on TikTok are evidence of the GDPR's ability to overcome these difficulties. It is now well established, meaning that there are now many sanctions that act as deterrents.Early 2019 saw the emergence of questions over artificial intelligence (AI), with the introduction of so-called ""augmented"" cameras and generative AI. These matters have become more significant and are now focusing much of the CNIL's energy. Companies are asking a lot of questions. And our aim, without waiting for the European regulation on artificial intelligence, which probably won't come into force before 2026, is to reconcile data protection with innovation, offering stakeholders support while providing legal certainty.We therefore launched an artificial intelligence plan last spring. Over the next few weeks, we will be publishing seven practical fact sheets detailing, for example, how to set up databases to train artificial intelligence systems. We will then publish other documents on generative AI and on the security issues specific to artificial intelligence systems. We are committed to providing this support because we believe in the growth of French and European AI operators.",/en/pixels/
Hollywood writers' strike officially over; Actors vote for walkout against video game makers,"    The five-month writer's strike has ended after unions and studios approved a deal, which members will vote on from October 2 to 9. Striking actors, meanwhile, remain on walkout and have voted to expand their strike to video games. ","Leaders of the screenwriters union declared their nearly five-month-old strike over Tuesday, September 26, after board members approved a contract agreement with studios, bringing Hollywood at least partly back from a historic halt in production. The governing boards of the eastern and western branches of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and their joint negotiating committee all voted to accept the deal, and afterward declared that the strike would be over and writers would be free to work starting at 12:01 am local time on Wednesday, September 27.Late-night talk shows – the first to go dark when writers walked out on May 2 – are likely the first shows that will resume. The writers still have to vote to ratify the contract themselves, but lifting the strike will allow them to work during that process, the Writers Guild told members in an email.After Tuesday's board votes, the contracts were released to the writers, who had not yet been given any details on the deal, which their leaders called ""exceptional."" The members will vote between October 2 and 9.Hollywood actors, however, remain on strike with no talks yet on the horizon, but a new spirit of optimism motivated those who were picketing on Tuesday, September 26, for the first time since writers reached their tentative deal on the night of Sunday, September 24. ""For a hot second, I really thought that this was going to go on until next year,"" said Marissa Cuevas, an actor who has appeared on the TV series Kung Fu and The Big Bang Theory. ""Knowing that at least one of us has gotten a good deal gives a lot of hope that we will also get a good deal.""Writers' picket lines had been suspended, but they were encouraged to walk in solidarity with actors, and many were beside them on Tuesday, September 26, including Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner, who picketed alongside friend and ER actor Noah Wyle as he has throughout the strikes. ""We would never have had the leverage we had if SAG had not gone out,"" Weiner said. ""They were very brave to do it.""Striking actors also voted to authorize their leadership to potentially expand their walkout to include the lucrative video game market, a step that could put new pressure on Hollywood studios to make a deal with the performers who provide voices and stunts for games.The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Radio and Television Artists (SAG-AFTRA) announced the move late on Monday, September 25, saying that 98% of its members voted to go on strike against video game companies if ongoing negotiations are not successful. The announcement came ahead of more talks planned for Tuesday, September 26.Acting in video games can include a variety of roles, from voice performances to motion capture work as well as stunts. Video game actors went on strike in 2016 in a work stoppage that lasted nearly a year.Some of the issues at stake in the video game negotiations are the same as in the broader actors strike that has shut down Hollywood for months, including wages, safety measures and protections on the use of artificial intelligence. The companies involved include gaming giants Activision, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Take 2 Productions as well as Warner Bros. and Disney's video game divisions.""It's time for the video game companies to stop playing games and get serious about reaching an agreement on this contract,"" SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in a statement.Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for video game producers, said they are ""continuing to negotiate in good faith"" and have reached tentative agreements on more than half of the proposals on the table. So far this year, US consumers have spent $34.9 billion on video games, consoles and accessories, according to market research group Circana.The threat of a video game strike emerged as Hollywood writers were on the verge of getting back to work after months on the picket lines. The alliance of studios, streaming services and producers has chosen to negotiate only with the writers so far and has made no overtures yet toward restarting talks with SAG-AFTRA. That will presumably change soon. SAG-AFTRA leaders have said they will look closely at the writers' agreement, which includes many of the same issues, but it will not affect their demands.",/en/pixels/
New French report warns that 'serious violations of human dignity' in porn is commonplace,"    Online pornography is abundantly filled with shocking and degrading scenes that could be punishable by law, according to a new report. The council behind the report wants the porn industry to be sanctioned. ","Sylvie Pierre-Brossolette thought it was crucial to cause a shock, to "" break through the wall of indifference"" surrounding the porn industry's sordid reality. Pierre-Brossolette is the president of the French High Council for Equality between Women and Men (HCE). Her report ""Porno-criminality: Putting an end to the porn industry's impunity,"" has achieved that goal. The report, which is due to be officially handed over to Bérangère Couillard, the French minister for gender equality, on Wednesday September 27, paints a terrifying picture.For over a year, the HCE's violence against women commission has been examining videos available to watch online. It organized a large number of hearings, reviewed existing literature and, in March, carried out a study of four pornography platforms (PornHub, Xhamster, Xvideos and Xnxx). More than 230 pages documented those investigations, accompanied by a warning from the HCE, which intends to ""draw attention to the serious violations of human dignity and the serious consequences of the unlimited and illegal distribution of this sexual content.""The videos display physical violence, verbal aggression and, in many cases, acts of torture and barbarism. The vast majority of the content on offer is packed with images that are not only shocking and degrading for women but are also liable to criminal sanctions under French law, explained the HCE.The advisory body, tasked with guiding government policy on equality issues, endorsed comments made by Laure Beccuau, the Paris public prosecutor. At a senate hearing in September 2022 on the first parliamentary report on the topic entitled ""Behind the Scenes"" (""L'envers du décor""), the judge said that ""90% of pornographic content contains physical or verbal violence, and is therefore criminally reprehensible.""""Our report is intended to be an in-depth examination and extension of the Senate report,"" said Pierre-Brossolette.A search on four sites distributing such content in France showed 70,118 videos under the keyword ""surprise"" and 13,898 under ""torture."" There were at least 1.4 million videos containing sadistic practices, including ""women tortured by electrocution, women asphyxiated in plastic bags, women screaming in pain."" What's happening in these videos, which can be accessed in just a few clicks, is not simulated. It is a "" horrifying reality: A significant proportion of pornographic videos distributed are videos of filmed rapes, revenge porn, or have been obtained through coercion in sexual exploitation rings,"" the researchers reported. ""Their suffering is perfectly visible and eroticized at the same time.""",/en/pixels/
Meta unveils AI integration in smart glasses and digital assistants,"    Meta has previously been slower than its peers to push out AI products, and is now introducing AI characters based on celebrities including Snoop Dogg and Paris Hilton. ","Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday, September 27, said the tech giant is putting artificial intelligence into digital assistants and smart glasses as it seeks to gain lost ground in the AI race. Zuckerberg made his announcements at the Connect developers conference at Meta's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the company's main annual product event.""Advances in AI allow us to create different (applications) and personas that help us accomplish different things,"" Zuckerberg said as he kicked off the gathering. ""And smart glasses are going to eventually allow us to bring all of this together into a stylish form factor that we can wear.""Smart glasses are one of the many ways that tech companies have tried to move beyond the smartphone as a user-friendly device, but so far with little success. The second-generation Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses made in a partnership with EssilorLuxottica will have a starting price of $299 when they hit the market on October 17.The smart glasses also add the ability for users to stream what they are seeing in real-time, Zuckerberg said. ""Smart glasses are the ideal form factor for you to let AI assistants see what you're seeing and hear what you're hearing.""Meta also introduced 28 AI characters that people can message on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram with ""personalities"" based on celebrities including Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton and YouTube star MrBeast. Zuckerberg demonstrated an interaction with one such AI from the stage in a type-written chat promising that the new bots would soon be voiced.""This is our first effort at training a bunch of AI that are a bit more fun,"" Zuckerberg said. ""But look, this is early stuff and these still have a lot of limitations, which you will see when you use them.""The event was the first in-person edition of Connect since 2019, before the pandemic, and announcements on generative AI were widely expected. Meta has taken a much more cautious approach than its rivals Microsoft, OpenAI and Google to push out AI products, prioritizing small steps and making its in-house models available to developers and researchers.Meta also unveiled the latest version of its Quest virtual reality headset with richer graphics, improved audio, and the ability for a wearer to see what is around them without taking the gear off, a demonstration for AFP showed. ""This is going to be a big game changer and a big capacity improvement for these headsets,"" Zuckerberg told developers gathered in a Meta headquarters courtyard.Quest 3 headsets were priced starting at $499 and will begin shipping on October 10, according to Meta. This is substantially cheaper than Apple's Vision Pro, which will cost a hefty $3,499 when it is available early next year in the United States only. The Quest 3 ""is going to be the best value on the market for a long time to come"", said Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth, to laughter from the audience.New game titles for Quest 3 included ""Assassin's Creed Nexus"" from Ubisoft as well as a Roblox game. ""Meta is trying to bring a much-upgraded version of (mixed-reality) to the masses,"" said Insider Intelligence principal analyst Yory Wurmser.Meta chief product officer Chris Cox joked to journalists that his sister complains that she often winds up punching furniture when using virtual reality, and that problem goes away when gear instead digitally augments the real world around a person. ""We think that mixed reality is a really big step from virtual reality, which is basically a fully occluded thing,"" Cox said. ""That will help make this more useful for more people.""",/en/pixels/
'Counter-Strike 2': The veteran shooter fires a new round,Long Read,"Like a sniper, Counter-Strike 2 (or CS2) likes to take players by surprise. The multiplayer shooter video game had only a vague release date, summer 2023, when it was revealed in March by its US creator Valve. Finally released on Wednesday, September 27, it's sure to be one of the most acclaimed titles of the year despite the publisher not rolling out any real promotional campaigns.For this, it can count on the vast community of fans of Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO), released in August 2012, of which CS2 is a free update. The previous installment in the series is the most-played video game on Steam, the leading platform for digital PC games, which is also owned by Valve; a record 1.8 million players were simultaneously connected to it in May. This fervor is also fueled by its competitions, which are among the biggest e-sport events on the planet: On May 21, over 12,000 people attended the final of the Major, Counter-Strike's biggest annual tournament, in the Parisian Accor Arena.Dreamed up by Vietnamese-Canadian programmer Minh Le during his studies in 1999, Counter-Strike is a veteran of the video game industry. At the time, the 22-year-old created video games by modifying existing titles – a practice known as modding. The idea for Counter-Strike was born while he was tinkering with Valve's hugely popular Half-Life (1998), whose realistic graphics he appreciated. He teamed up with US video game designer Jeff Cliffe, and the duo perfected the first version of the ""mod"" in just two months.The concept is based on two opposing teams: Terrorists versus the forces of law and order. A team wins a round when it eliminates all opposing players or achieves its objective – the most popular scenario is to plant (or successfully defuse) a bomb.Within a few months, Counter-Strike had won over FPS (""First Person Shooter"") fans, who were often discovering the joys of multiplayer games thanks to the first broadband connections, cybercafés and local network competitions, ""LAN-parties"" (local area network parties). By March 2000, it was steadily establishing itself as the most-played shooting game online, observed the British site Eurogamer at the time. ""It's flattering, but at the same time we know that it can dissipate at any time,"" said Le.This success did not escape the creators of Half-Life. In early 2000, Valve bought the intellectual property of Counter-Strike from the two ""modders"" and hired them to develop an official version, released in November 2000, called Half-Life: Counter-Strike. The game reached a wider audience and was well-received by critics.Then-rivals Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament were no match for Counter-Strike's strategic depth. The most precise players with the best reflexes are not guaranteed victory: Before the game, each team must first manage its finances to buy weapons and equipment, and team coordination and knowledge of the levels are essential to win.The excitement surrounding the game soon led to the creation of teams and leagues in which players could compete. In December 2001, the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL), the first professional e-sports competition circuit, organized an international Counter-Strike tournament in Dallas. It is regarded as the forerunner of the Majors, now managed by Valve.Its tactical and intense games provide a spectacle rich in twists and turns. The attendance of the public – mostly male, as professional player Stephanie Harvey, aka ""missharvey"" reminded Le Monde – is consolidated by the virality of YouTube videos from 2005, then Twitch live game broadcasts, after its launch in 2011. Eventually, tournaments became more professional, attracting the attention of new investors, sponsors, mainstream media and even politicians. During the Paris Major, two ministers were in the stands.But scammers and cheats are also part of the game. Match-fixing scandals have rocked the professional circuit and, in 2021, the e-sport integrity commission banned three players from competitions for match-fixing. The dice can also be loaded in the amateur sphere, such as with hacks that allow you to aim automatically, see through walls or go faster. Since the game's inception, developers have had to constantly adapt to the new tricks of cheaters.However, these excesses have never seriously threatened the future of Counter-Strike. For the franchise, the most difficult equation to solve lies elsewhere: How to modernize without upsetting the gaming experience? Any radical change would call into question hours or years of player training. ""You can't instantly bring a new game online without risking the integrity of the sport,"" Shaun Clark, head of Counter-Strike at the Electronic Sports League (ESL), said in June about CS2.That's why Valve insisted on a visual facelift, with less dull colors, new lighting, more detailed textures and better smoke modeling. Iconic game maps like ""Dust II"" and ""Mirage"" have been embellished but not changed; altering their layout would be as disruptive to a player as moving the lines or dimensions of a football field before a new season.This concern for fidelity has ensured the series' longevity, but it also makes it inflexible. It's hard for it to adapt to the innovations of its rivals, such as PUBG: Battleground (2017) and its addictive ""battle royale"" principle, in which 100 players battle it out on an island, or the dynamism of Valorant (2020), which is more accessible to younger players. In 2019, Le confessed to having curbed his creativity for fear of ""offending the community."" He left Valve in 2006 to pursue new projects.CS: GO nevertheless underwent a major transformation in 2013, with the introduction of skins. With no impact on the way the game is played, these virtual cosmetic objects – weapons or equipment of various appearances – can be bought or resold with real money. In addition to trigger-happy gamers, the venerable shooter now attracts collectors and speculators; some items trade at a premium, such as the rarest edition of the AWP Dragon Lore rifle (over $400,000), or the so-called ""Blue Gem"" version of the Karambit knife ($1.5 million). This expensive equipment will of course be automatically switched over from CS: GO to CS2: The sniper's mission is not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.",/en/pixels/
Tech giants race to unleash conversational AI assistants,"    Recent announcements from Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon highlight their investment in AI to usher in a new generation of virtual assistants, but questions are being raised regarding the practicality and ethical implications of these new services. ","If an Instagram or WhatsApp user could ask an ""assistant"" a question at any time, they might ask it to suggest nearby restaurants, have it perform a web search to ""settle a controversy between friends,"" or even ask it to create an image of an ocean liner equipped with sails to see what such a ship would look like. This was the vision presented by Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday, September 27. The Meta founder announced the rollout of 28 conversational bots across the Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger platforms. One of the tools will serve as a generalist, while the rest will focus on specific themes like cooking, combat sports, fashion, and more. Each thematic tool will feature an avatar representing a personality, such as rapper Snoop Dogg or fashion influencer Paris Hilton.""Launched in beta version in the US, the conversational robots are set to undergo continued development following their initial roll-out on social media. In the coming months, Meta intends to enable developers, brands and influencers to create their own versions.Zuckerberg's enthusiastic presentation was the latest in a series of announcements made over a few days by the tech giants in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Since the successful launch of the ChatGPT conversational robot in late 2022, its creator OpenAI, its partner Microsoft and their rivals Google, Meta and Amazon have entered an AI race that has resulted in a flurry of launches.The virtual personal assistant idea is the common thread of the announcements. AI has revived the tech industry's old dream of a universal companion to help users in their daily lives, leisure and work. The concept recalls early voice assistants such as Apple's Siri, Google Assistant or Alexa, created in 2014 by Amazon with inspiration from the omniscient Star Trek computer. The new conversational assistants are ""21st century Clippy"" explained Mor Naaman, a Cornell Tech professor specializing in human-AI communication in a press release, in a reference to the paper clip with human features launched by Microsoft in its Office suite in 1996 that was deactivated in 2001 following a barrage of mockery.On Tuesday, September 26, Microsoft launched another ""everyday companion"" in Windows 11, the latest version of its operating system. Available for the moment in North America, Asia and South America, the assistant, called Copilot, uses intelligence from Microsoft's partner OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. According to Microsoft, the assistant is accessible via special buttons or in a dialog box and can summarize a text, explain a subject, write a draft or create a video from vacation photos. Copilot will be extended to MS Office software (Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, etc.) in November.",/en/pixels/
AI's dizzying capability to dub one voice into a foreign language,    Tools from the startup HeyGen and the Internet giant Google use artificial intelligence to translate videos by cloning and synchronizing the speaker's voice. ,"It's a video of an internet user filming himself speaking in English on his mobile phone. Then we see the same clip again, but the person is now speaking in French, with no change in the tone of voice or lip movement. Then the video starts again, this time in German. This short demo, posted on September 11 by @mrjonfinger on X (formerly Twitter), illustrates the impressive and disturbing effect of new tools that are capable, thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), of generating an automatic dubbing, while cloning the speaker's voice and synchronizing their diction. Already viewed over 7 million times, this video uses software created by an American startup, HeyGen. But other companies, including Google, have similar applications. This latest breakthrough in AI increases questions about the future of translation and dubbing.On the internet, several impressed or amused people have tried out HeyGen's tool. Digital consultant Michel Levy Provençal tested this ""revolutionary new function for automatic video translation"" in Spanish, Polish, Hindi, etc. Others have dubbed a Jacques Brel song, a Lionel Messi press conference and a Charles de Gaulle speech.The HeyGen website allows users to try out the tool free of charge for around two minutes of video, but they have to pass through a queue which, on Thursday, September 14, had over 100,000 files. The startup also offers paid subscriptions (e.g. $48 (€45) a month for around 30 minutes of video).These synthetic dubbing tools are impressive, combining several AI techniques already on the market. They combine transcription from sound to text (Trint, DeepL or YouTube, which generates automatic subtitles on its videos), translation (DeepL, ChatGPT, Google Translate, etc.); text-to-speech synthesis; and the cloning of a voice from a recording. Voice cloning from a recording will soon be offered by Apple with its Personal Voice tool, which targets people prone to voice loss or illness.Software such as HeyGen raises the specter of breathtaking AI developments in translation. Tomorrow, will we be able to hear any foreign speaker translated live through our smartphone's headphones? Will we be able to watch any video or film dubbed into any language?Such a prospect raises questions and concerns. There are, of course, questions about translation quality and accents (the French in the X video sounds a little Québécois). In May, Google demonstrated a similar tool, Universal Translator, but opted to let ""trusted"" testers try it out before making it available to the general public. ""Some of these technologies could be used by the wrong people or organizations, for example to create deepfakes [deceptive realistic videos generated by AI],"" the company explained. Google added that it was working on tagging systems to recognize AI-created content, in order to combat misinformation.",/en/pixels/
Macron's camp keen on presenting AI as an opportunity,"    The French president's loyal followers are insisting on the potential artificial intelligence represents for France, using it as a dividing issue with the far right.

But the economist has little interest in science fiction. Since September 19, he has been co-chairing the committee of experts on artificial intelligence (AI), launched by French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, whose mission is to present ""concrete proposals"" for adapting France's ""national strategy"" within the next six months. While the inter-ministerial committee is tasked with exploring the potential effects of this new technology, as fascinating as it is frightening, on employment, inequality and happiness at work, the Collège de France professor is approaching his subject with ""Churchillian optimism,"" he said.Aware of the dangers of AI, the former Harvard professor imagines, in six months, showing above all the extent of the benefits of this technology and reducing its anxiety-provoking potential. ""You're less afraid of something when you know more about it,"" he told Le Monde, assuring that he hadn't heard Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right Rassemblement national (RN) party, speak on the subject in the spring.The 28-year-old's keen interest in AI, which he describes as ""the most dizzying challenge of our century,"" has nonetheless baffled the government. ""In the knowledge economy, mankind is going to have the power of the gods in his hands: to colonize the cosmos, to carry out embryonic selection, to regulate genetics. France must regulate and innovate,"" pleaded Marine Le Pen's protégé on French television on April 2.Until now, French President Emmanuel Macron's supporters were alone, or almost alone, in taking political hold of this subject. Back in 2017, Macron, champion of the ""start-up nation,"" commissioned mathematician Cédric Villani to produce a report on this technology likely to provoke a shock comparable to the invention of the printing press or the Internet. At the time, France, like Europe, had been left behind by the digital giants. It is non-existent in the world of social media, and absent from the smartphone and search engine markets. The country had to get behind the Californian geeks and the Chinese brains to quickly bring out champions of artificial intelligence on French soil, with a great deal of public money: €1.5 billion was put on the table.Six years later, the arrival of ChatGPT, software capable of sustaining a lightning-fast online conversation, propelled AI into the public arena, carrying with it its share of theories about machines overtaking man. The call for a ""pause"" in AI development, signed in March by billionaire Elon Musk and hundreds of experts, underlining ""major risks for humanity,"" has only fueled these fears.",/en/pixels/
PlayStation: The head of Sony's video game division is stepping down,"    Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced the forthcoming departure of its CEO, Jim Ryan, who spearheaded the launch of the PlayStation 5. ","Jim Ryan, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), Sony's video game division, will step down in March 2024, the company announced in a statement on Wednesday, September 27. ""Jim Ryan has made the decision to retire in March 2024 after nearly 30 years with PlayStation,"" Sony said.""I have relished the opportunity to have a job I love in such a special company (...). But I'm finding it increasingly difficult to reconcile my life in Europe with my work in North America,"" said Ryan on September 27. The Japanese multinational's video game subsidiary is based in San Mateo, California.The 63-year-old Briton, who grew up in the suburbs of Newcastle, joined SIE in 1994, the year the first PlayStation was launched in Japan. He went on to head up the company's European branch and held a number of senior positions, including SIE's sales and marketing director, before being appointed president and CEO in 2019. Hiroki Totoki, Sony's chief operating and financial officer, will act as interim CEO from April 1, 2024, pending the appointment of a new CEO.In November 2020, Jim Ryan was at the helm of the launch of Sony's latest console, the PlayStation 5, in a period marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its release was notably disrupted by component shortages and a reduced number of consoles in store. It has since sold over 40 million units, according to the manufacturer.Ryan was also at the forefront of Sony's fight to prevent Microsoft's $69 billion takeover of publisher Activision Blizzard (Call of Duty, Diablo 4, Candy Crush). On several occasions, it has claimed that this takeover would enable its competitor, the Xbox console maker, to offer exclusivity for the hugely successful Call of Duty shooter series. Last July, while the takeover was under scrutiny by US and British competition authorities, Microsoft and SIE signed an agreement to ensure that the license would continue to be released on PlayStation.Under Ryan's presidency, SIE also worked on the buyouts of several studios, including Bungie (the American creators of Halo and Destiny) for $3.6 billion, or the Finnish Housemarque (creators of Returnal).",/en/pixels/
"The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the 'Mozart of crypto,' and the bankruptcy of FTX","    Charged with fraud and money laundering, Bankman-Fried faces more than 100 years in prison. His trial is set to begin on Tuesday. ","His fortune had been estimated at $26 billion. He would strut around in shorts and a T-shirt with disheveled hair at conferences and generously provide funding to political officials, primarily Democrats. He recruited celebrities to promote his venture, such as Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen and her then-husband, NFL star Tom Brady. This was during the Bitcoin frenzy of 2021 and 2022.But on October 3, 31-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried, aka SBF, will be taken from his prison cell to appear at the first day of his trial in Manhattan, and the ""Mozart of crypto"" has nothing left. The son of professors from Stanford University's Law School in California, he himself studied mathematics and physics at the prestigious MIT. He has now been abandoned by his main associates as well as his former girlfriend Caroline Ellison, who have chosen to cooperate with US courts.Bankman-Fried faces more than 100 years in prison in relation to the largest cryptocurrency-related bankruptcy in history: the FTX platform. He is accused of diverting clients' money to reinvest it in high-risk bets in the Bahamas through a trading subsidiary called Alameda.Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has survived the turmoil and is currently trading at around $27,200, which is 40% higher than a year ago but less than half of the $69,000 peak it reached in November 2021 during the speculative frenzy. No one believes that these currencies, which have no underlying assets, are secure, as the platforms meant to host them often turn out to be traps, like FTX, the platform founded by SBF.The crisis has its roots in 2021 when the post-Covid bubble began to deflate. The value of many cryptocurrencies started to plummet, as did some trading platforms, but FTX appeared to be a safe haven, like its rival, Binance. Things took a turn for the worse in November 2022, when an article by the media outlet CoinDesk revealed that Alameda had converted a significant portion of its assets into FTT, a cryptocurrency created by FTX, exposing it to a currency collapse.Savers rushed to withdraw their funds, adding to the panic. Bankman-Fried tried to seek salvation from his rival, Binance, but it abandoned him. On November 6, 2022, Binance's CEO Changpeng Zhao, a 45-year-old Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur, decided to withdraw around $500 million in cryptocurrencies from the FTX platform.The fall was inevitable. On November 11, the company filed for bankruptcy with a Delaware court, along with approximately 130 subsidiaries, in what appeared to be the largest collapse in the world of cryptocurrencies.",/en/pixels/
'The EU would benefit greatly from regulating AI',"With the US a technological driving force, Europe wants to be a pioneer in regulating AI, writes digital ethics specialist Laurence Devillers.","In today's tense geopolitical context, technological warfare rages on. ""The one who becomes the leader in this sphere (of artificial intelligence) will be the ruler of the world,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin told students in 2017 in Yaroslavl. The race for ever more powerful systems is also accelerating AI capabilities and its takeover.The challenges of increasing fake news stories have come to the fore with the deployment of generative artificial intelligence systems such as Dall-E and StableDiffusion for images and videos and ChatGPT, which uses language models from OpenAI. While the ChatGPT conversational robot can produce useful essays and summaries, it is impossible to know its sources or measure the influence of the dominant English language in its models. ChatGPT has rightly triggered excitement and fear among the general public, with questions such as: ""Should it be banned from schools?""; ""Will it take my job?"" or ""Will I be able to do without it?""For these huge models, Europe intends to propose joint responsibility between the manufacturers of the models who put them on the market or publish them in open access, those who deploy them, and those who use them. This is not an idea that is shared by the American digital giants' managers, who would prefer to shift responsibility to users instead. Silicon Valley technology aficionados Elon Musk, OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman, and many others are also ideologues with a global political vision. The United States, like China, is calling for standards in this race to dominate the technological landscape while stimulating innovation, the guarantor of power.The European Union has much to gain by developing a framework for the use of AI associated with trust and respect for human rights and the rule of law. Its AI Act, under preparation, focuses on identifying applications that present a risk and therefore require regulation.Four levels of risk (unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal) call for different actions. Unacceptably risky applications will be banned, for example, for manipulative ""subliminal techniques"" that exploit specific vulnerable groups or are used by public authorities for social evaluation purposes, as in China. High-risk applications will be tightly regulated. This should be with a high level of specificity to preserve useful applications. For example, facial recognition is a danger if used to monitor the population, but it is proving to be a very useful tool for monitoring pathologies in patients. The AI Act therefore proposes to offer protection. In particular, it imposes obligations on certain AI systems because of the specific risks they present to algorithms interacting with humans.",/en/pixels/
"The great AI debate: 'Which is better, human or machine?'",Professor Brian Hill reports on an enlightening experiment in which his students worked with a chatbot. The findings suggest that the workers of tomorrow are likely to deliver significantly lower-quality work when assisted by AI tools than when working alone.,"When ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, a number of debates emerged, many of which revolved around an age-old question: Which is better, human or machine?Given the predicted importance that these tools will have in future professional practice, the real question is actually more nuanced: do humans do a better job on their own, or when they rely on artificial intelligence (AI)? More precisely: are they able to make good use of AI – to assess it correctly and correct its responses where necessary – to improve their performance?A recent study suggests that this question is not as clear-cut as one might think. It concerns an assignment given in a class at HEC Paris (France's most prestigious business school), in which each student was randomly assigned two case studies.For the first case, students had to write an answer to the assigned question from scratch. For the second, they received a ready-made answer, which they had to evaluate and, if necessary, correct. They were told that each answer could have been provided by ChatGPT, which was indeed the case for most of them. The students' final answers were graded using the same scoring system: the most important thing was to deliver a full reply to the question, whether it was the result of a correction or not (""Taking the help or going alone: ChatGPT and class assignments,"" June 2023).While the first exercise is representative of ""traditional"" work practices, the second may end up corresponding more closely to many jobs in the future. Indeed, if AI tools become as ubiquitous as many predict, the human role will be to evaluate and correct the results produced by AI.And yet, the students were less successful in this second exercise: the average mark for the corrected version of the ready-made answer was 28% lower than the average mark for the task in which students wrote their own answers. Even when controlling for the same case study, a student who corrected ChatGPT's work lost an average of 28 points out of 100 compared with a student working alone. In short, students perform much worse if they are provided with ChatGPT's help and then asked to correct it, than if they have to provide an answer from scratch.Are these results due to high student trust in ChatGPT's answers? The students were explicitly warned to be wary of the answers they were given: they were told that ChatGPT had been tested on a similar assignment and that it had achieved rather mediocre results.A more likely explanation would be confirmation bias, i.e. ""interpreting evidence in ways that are partial to existing beliefs, expectations, or a hypothesis in hand.""",/en/pixels/
What's in the French bill to 'secure and regulate digital space' from pornography and online harassment?,"    Portions of the bill, which also concerns scams, deepfakes, trolls and identification, might be difficult to negotiate on the floor of the Assemblée Nationale. ","Since Wednesday, October 4, MPs are debating one of the most important pieces of digital legislation of Emmanuel Macron's second term on the floor of the Assemblée Nationale, following the senators' unanimous vote on July 5. The bill to ""secure and regulate digital space"" (""sécuriser et réguler l’espace numérique"", SREN), championed by Junior Digital Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, is a patchwork of measures ranging from fighting online harassment to controlling access to pornographic sites, and even to combating phishing.Article 6 of the bill details what has been presented as an ""anti-scam filter"", designed to combat online crimes, mainly phishing. This concerns sites ""manifestly designed"" to carry out specific offenses: identity theft, illegal data collection, bank fraud and even hacking into a computer system. When such a site is discovered by the authorities, they can contact its publisher and ask them to put a stop to the offenses detected, and at the same time alert browser developers (Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, etc.), who must display a warning message to visitors.If it is impossible to identify and contact the publisher, the authorities can directly request that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Domain Name System (DNS, which route online traffic) providers block the offending domain name without delay. The idea of imposing such a restriction on browser developers, against which the Mozilla Foundation (which distributes Firefox software) had been particularly vocal, was finally abandoned. The main Web browsers already include tools to identify certain fraudulent sites and alert users who visit them.One of the main points of contention in the text is Article 1, which requires that the French Audiovisual and Digital Communication Regulatory Authority (ARCOM) publish a technical reference guide specifying the steps to be taken to implement an age verification tool on pornographic sites. A law passed in July 2020, which requires publishers of such sites to set up verification tools and decrees that a mere self-declaration is insufficient, already gave the ARCOM the possibility of establishing such a reference guide. But the authority never did so, and the leaders of the pornographic industry have used this in the courts, arguing that there is no reliable method that respects user privacy.The SREN bill stipulates that the ARCOM must publish this reference guide within six months after the law passes. However, some child protection associations as well as a number of MPs are opposed to this stipulation, believing that it provides pornographic sites with new ammunition with which to defend themselves. In their view, it is up to the platforms to find and implement technical solutions to prevent minors from accessing their content.",/en/pixels/
"AI and culture, friends or foes?",Investigation,"""We try not to be afraid,"" said Steve Carell, in French. Constantin Pappas has seen many technological revolutions in his 40 years as a dubbing stalwart across 35-millimeter reels, video and digital. But, for the first time this summer, he felt like he had to restart his B&B project in the countryside. And AI can take the blame, with its immediate automated translation, actors with faces made eternal, the duplication of extras and algorithm-generated scenes.Jean-François Bonnefon, director of research in cognitive psychology at the Toulouse School of Economics, said, ""We're about to witness an upheaval in human culture which, in terms of its importance, is the equivalent of the return of the explorers from China in the time of Marco Polo, their arms laden with novelties such as paper money and the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg. All the great culture shocks known to European history are going to be concentrated in a few years.""As seen with the five-month strike that brought Hollywood to a standstill, the world of culture has turned upside down in the face of the programmed obsolescence of its professions. ""The only thing,"" Pappas said, ""is that if Robert De Niro was told: 'Your voice is going to be used in 37 countries in 37 languages,' I'm not sure he'd accept. Or he might ask for such a phenomenal sum that dubbing would remain a more economical solution.""The arrival on the market of ChatGPT at the beginning of the year was a wake-up call. This fall, not one film festival, not one publisher's meeting, not one musical gathering doesn't feature a round table on artificial intelligence. The word ""replacement"" keeps coming up everywhere. Civilization is threatened by the advent of a world of algorithms. ""The fear of a culture that we think threatens us, even if it's a question of stereotypes or prejudices, is even more accentuated with AI because nobody really knows what machine culture is like. And there's nothing to hold on to,"" said Bonnefon.Technophile economists may well predict that AI will also create jobs, according to Schumpeter's theory of creative destruction, but the fear is there. All the more so as, this time, it's no longer operational jobs that are being targeted, but decision-making and creative jobs, which previous generations had favored, and which seemed to us to be the most inextricably human. And behind this fear lies a much deeper, muted sense of replacement: that of the human being itself, the extinction of our species.",/en/pixels/
"On TikTok, the success of 'sliced up' films and TV series","    Users of the social media app have grown accustomed to viewing posts by anonymous accounts showing works broken up into a series of videos. In light of this success, producers are looking to imitate them. ","On Tuesday, October 3, production company Paramount Pictures pulled off a marketing coup on TikTok by publishing one of its 2004 hits on the platform free of charge: Mean Girls by Mark Waters. Users could watch one of the most iconic films in the career of 2000s icon Lindsay Lohan, free of charge. For the occasion, the film was cut into 23 short videos.Why this film? Emblematic of online culture, Mean Girls is a reservoir of memes from which internet users like to draw to invoke the figure of the popular but insensitive and superficial person.Why this day? Because one of the characters refers to this date in the feature film and it has evolved into ""Mean Girls Day."" Finally, the choice of format was inspired by the hundreds of accounts on the platform that illegally broadcast reports, series and even films – including Mean Girls. In August, NBC relied on the same strategy, previewing an episode of its comedy Killing It, as The Guardian reported.This is because, on TikTok, users are crazy about these works, which, to comply with the platform's standards, are broken up into short videos. Excerpts from blockbusters, romantic comedies and TV shows can reach thousands of views. So much so, in fact, that it is not uncommon for them to appear on the application's home page (the ""For You"" feed). Some users even purposely leave the message ""I'm commenting for the algorithm"" under an excerpt, in the hope of being automatically offered the rest of the video. It is a practice described in the 2023 book Le Système TikTok by journalist Océane Herrero.But this is nothing new: Back in the 2000s, with the spread of piracy, many internet users were already downloading films in chunks. Later, video-sharing sites such as YouTube also saw the emergence of unlicensed publications of fragmented films.On TikTok, this content is increasingly numerous, bringing back into fashion movies that are sometimes several decades old, as Radio Canada points out, or giving new popularity to hits like Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" (1977). Series or films from the past such as Mean Girls, Legally Blonde (2001) and Malcolm in the Middle (2000-2006) are also popular. The presence of this copyright-protected content seems to be moderated with uneven zeal by the platform, which also raises questions as to the tolerance level of production companies regarding this practice.One might suspect that rights holders are counting on the fact that these video snippets have the effect of a trailer or teaser, and encourage the less relentless internet users to view films in a more conventional, legal and, above all, more comfortable way. Their effectiveness remains to be seen, but they illustrate TikTok's growing influence on the way internet users consume audiovisual content.In any case, Mean Girls has since disappeared from the official TikTok account @meangirls, which now boasts 154,000 subscriptions.",/en/pixels/
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets have their own world championship,In Depth,"Forget the Rugby World Cup and the end of its group stage this weekend. Another international competition kicked off on Saturday, October 7: the Microsoft Excel World Championship (MEWC). For two months, 128 contestants will compete for the trophy, won last year by Andrew Ngai of Australia.At first glance, nothing seems further removed than Excel from the most famous competitive video games, such as League of Legends or Counter-Strike. Yet the format of the championship is reminiscent of e-sports, with online events, games with commentary and cash prizes – $15,000 (more than €14,000) – to reward the top finishers. The final, scheduled for December 7, will even be held at the HyperX Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, where video game tournaments regularly take place.But unlike e-sports enthusiasts, young prodigies of the joystick or keyboard who turn their hobby into a profession, MEWC participants do the opposite: As experienced professionals, they explore the playful aspects of their work tool.""I take part in this competition to have fun and it also allows me to improve,"" explained Barbara Mauric, a 48-year-old management controller for Italian shipowner d'Amico. Mauric, who has been using Excel on a daily basis since 2008, said, ""I learn various things about the software from the other participants and can apply them to other situations.""Mauric is competing in the Financial Modeling World Cup (FMWC), a competition whose origins date back to 2012 and which, in its current form, is organized by AG Capital, the creator of the Excel World Championship. The FMWC – where the spreadsheet is also king – features a number of events in which contestants must use the financial data of a fictitious company to make a projection of potential performance.Wishing to reach a wider audience, AG Capital's CEO, Andrew Grigolyunovich of Latvia, subsequently launched the MEWC in 2021. ""There are a huge number of people who know Excel but don't have a finance background. For example, there are mathematicians or engineers who are very good at it, and I wanted to see them take part in this kind of competition anyway,"" said Grigolyunovich, who used to compete in financial modeling tournaments himself.The tests offered to contestants now resemble puzzles in worlds far removed from that of business: slot-machine screens whose scores must be calculated, race tracks to get through by rolling dice or tables of biathlon competition results to decipher. Bear Island, for example, consists of a series of problems to be solved using a map of an island inhabited by wild animals, drawn by coloring in the cells.Each challenge has to be solved within 30 minutes, but the matches aren't all about completing the maximum number of tasks in the allotted time. To win, you need to find the most effective formulas and tools to earn the maximum number of points by achieving predefined objectives. The competition is like Excel: It favors efficiency and rigor.""What's so special about these tests is that you have to ask yourself: 'Well, what approach am I going to take? What's it going to be like compared to the others? Because we don't have much time and we're stressed, there are things we don't think about,"" said Nicolas Micot, a 27-year-old risk manager for a company in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of France. Micot, who reached the second qualifying round in 2022, added, ""Afterward, you can look at the others on the stream and say to yourself: 'Darn, it's true that if I'd done that, I wouldn't have gotten so worked up about it,.'""But how entertaining is it to watch people fill in Excel spreadsheets? ""From the outset, I wanted it to be fun to watch,"" said Grigolyunovich. To achieve this, he drew direct inspiration from the conventions of e-sports, imagining ""battle"" formats in which up to eight players compete, and enlisted the help of a colorful commentator, Excel trainer and videographer Oz du Soleil.To ensure audience loyalty, organizers also encourage participants to turn on their webcams and feature certain leading figures. Irish virtuoso Diarmuid Early, dubbed the ""Michael Jordan of Excel"" by the community, has increasingly been featured in YouTube videos and publications on the social media platform LinkedIn, just like the reigning world champion.The competition has reached a wide audience at last, thanks to its broadcast on US television. Since last year, the championship has been reaired on the sports channel ESPN, which has a program dedicated to the most unexpected disciplines, such as competitive tag. ""I'm glad it's interesting even for those who don't work with Excel,"" said Mauric, amused by the program's success. ""We'll see what they come up with in the future to keep us on our toes.""And that's not to mention the obvious interest for Microsoft. ""Watching matches is great advertising for new versions of the software,"" added Micot. ""The latest version includes new formulas that are used by certain players. This is bound to inspire other software developers and owners.""",/en/pixels/
'Generative AI doesn't hesitate to plagiarize on a massive scale',Computer scientist Serge Abiteboul calls for a clear distinction to be made between creations by humans and those by artificial intelligence.,"Binaire is a blog hosted by Le Monde, the brainchild of a group of friends. To talk about computers, digital technology and science, we look for topics and then for authors. We then ask the authors to write an article on the chosen topic. This work competes with our other activities: work, pétanque, aperitifs, etc.A lazy idea (like all the best ideas) would be to ask artificial intelligence (AI) to do the work for us. This would involve helping us find hot topics and possible authors. But let's go crazy – why not just place our order outright? ""AI, write us an article for Binaire in the style of a particular one of our authors, on quantum computing or the blockchain.""Let's quickly recall how these AIs work. A deep neural network is fed huge quantities of text. From this, it builds a large language model. It can then produce the most likely combinations of words around the instructions given to it, without understanding anything about it. There's nothing magical about it, even if the technique is actually a tad more complex. But the results are impressive.Generative AIs work off of all the texts they've been fed. What's new about that? Writers also draw inspiration from all the texts they've read. In a way, they too write based on an (intuitive) language model that they construct from what they have read. They also borrow, although we call them inspirations, references, and so on when it comes to human writing.So, what does generative AI change? First of all, it doesn't hesitate to plagiarize on a massive scale, obviously without the slightest awareness of doing so. Another difference is that today, these AIs are content to generate text without understanding the meaning of what they're saying. But what about tomorrow? When they hide their ""borrowings"" better, when the ""monkey trick"" stage of AIs has been surpassed, it won't be so simple to see a difference.And if we tolerate such plundering, why bother paying a creator if AI can do the same work at a lower cost? The answer is obvious: because these AIs only exist by feeding off human creations. Beyond those creations that have passed into the public domain, living humans are indispensable in order for AIs to talk about current events, adapt to the constant evolution of language and to stay ""connected.""In fact, some creators are beginning to ask to be compensated for what these generative AIs borrow from them. They are taking legal action based on copyright law. Whether they are writers, journalists, code developers, or illustrators, this concern seems legitimate, even if the borrowings are not always easy to prove.",/en/pixels/
"'ChatGPT, what are we doing for dinner tonight?'","    AI will revolutionize the economy, education and intellectual and artistic creation. But today, those who embrace it without delay often have more prosaic objectives. ","Anyone who has tried to settle disagreements by letter knows that the difficulty lies not so much in the time spent writing it, but in the time spent brooding over it. That's what Nolan, a young town-planning engineer from Lorient (northwestern France), told himself when he asked ChatGPT to reply in his place to the estate agent with whom he was in conflict over some work to be carried out. ""He had written to me in a very unpleasant tone. I asked ChatGPT for a very respectful letter, with a lot of kindness, in a literary and formal style."" Basically, the opposite of what he had set out to write. He found the result effective: The agent in question didn't come forward again and, more importantly, it allowed Nolan to ""not spend too much time on an unpleasant task."" Normally, he asks the artificial intelligence (AI) to write him specifications for the construction of parking lots, or statements of decision at the end of work meetings.ChatGPT, the tool developed by OpenAI that offers on-demand text using artificial intelligence, has been the talk of the town since it was unveiled in November 2022. Like other artificial intelligence systems, such as Bard or Aria, it raises two big questions: Will AI take our jobs? And will it allow students to cheat at school? Most of the first books published explaining how to use AI aim to make readers money or improve their personal productivity, as if work and study were the only reservoirs of tasks to be outsourced. And yet, when we ask users to consult the history of their most recent queries, we see just how many everyday challenges could do with a helping hand.With his teenage son, Romain Meunier, a comic book author based in Reims (northeastern France), called on AI when he realized that the blackberries he'd bought were too acidic. ""We also had peppers that we didn't know what to do with, and people were coming for dinner."" ChatGPT suggested dishes for them to cook, including a blackberry cream that turned out excellent (the muffins and toast were great, too). Father and son certainly worded their request better than Vincent Flibustier, a trainer in media literacy and fake news, who had asked the artificial intelligence for ""creative ideas for using all the zucchini from [his] brother's harvest."" ChatGPT's suggestions included a zucchini castle contest, around which the algorithm proposed organizing a medieval festival. (The idea of freezing the zucchini cut into pieces to preserve them was not deemed ""creative"" enough).",/en/pixels/
EU warns Musk that Hamas attack disinformation is spreading on his platform X,"    Following Hamas' attack on Israel, EU commissioner Thierry Breton issued a stern warning to Musk, raising concerns about X's compliance with the EU Digital Services Act. ","EU commissioner Thierry Breton warned Elon Musk on Tuesday, October 10, that his platform X, formerly Twitter, is spreading ""illegal content and disinformation"", in a letter seen by AFP. The letter said concerns had heightened after the Hamas attack against Israel, and demanded Musk respond to the complaint within 24 hours and contact ""relevant law enforcement authorities"".As the European Union's commissioner for the Internal Market, Breton is charged with regulating internet giants that trade within the bloc and can launch legal action. ""Following the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas against Israel, we have indications that your platform is being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU,"" Breton wrote.Breton reminded Musk that EU law sets tough rules on moderating content, ""especially when it comes to violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform"". He asked that X respond to his complaint within 24 hours and also get in touch with Europol, the EU police coordinating agency.""We will include your answer in our assessment file on your compliance with the DSA,"" Breton said, referring to the new EU Digital Services Act, which regulates online platforms. ""I remind you that following the opening of a potential investigation and a finding of non-compliance, penalties can be imposed,"" it said.Musk, responding later on X to a user who had posted the letter, invited Breton to ""please list the violations you allude to"". ""Our policy is that everything is open source and transparent, an approach that I know the EU supports,"" Musk wrote.Brussels has previously complained that, among the large-scale internet platforms that fall under the DSA remit, Musk's Twitter, now rebranded X, spreads the biggest proportion of disinformation. In August, when the new law came into effect, Musk replied to a post by Breton promising that the platform was ""working hard"" to comply, but there have been more warning signs.While the rules were still voluntary, the firm pulled out of an oversight group, and Musk – a self-styled ""free speech absolutist"" – has been dismissive of criticism in his personal posts. In September, the billionaire tech mogul boasted that he had cut half of its global team dedicated to monitoring and limiting disinformation and fraud around major elections.Since Saturday's shock attack on Israeli communities by the Hamas militant group, web platforms have been swamped by posts containing fake or misrepresented reports and footage. While the confirmed death toll in the renewed war has now passed 3,000 – unconfirmed, exaggerated or false reports of atrocities have also proliferated. Experts fear these moves have increased the risk of misinformation provoking real-world harm, amplifying hate and violence.",/en/pixels/
Pommard vs Pomerol: Showdown between Burgundy and Bordeaux red wines,"They sound the same, have the same prestige – but their taste is very different. Don't confuse Pommard and Pomerol anymore.","A Pommard is a red wine from Burgundy, from the Côte de Beaune, and more precisely the area between Beaune and Volnay, in the Côte-d'Or (east). Not surprisingly, it is a pinot noir, the grape variety of the great Burgundian red wines. Pommard has an excellent reputation. The wines are rare and expensive: It is hard to find bottles under 30 euros (you can always write to me if you have a foolproof plan); you're better off aiming for the upper-limit of contactless payment, namely around 50 euros. And you'll need to triple this amount for the stars of this 'village appellation.'Pommard has a starring role, halfway between Sean Penn and Liam Neeson. Unexpectedly muscular, but we will come back to that. A star, in any case, and what's more, out of the 340+ hectares of the appellation, a third is classed as premier cru. That means there are 28 ""climats"" (ancestral name for the Burgundy terroirs ) which stand out from the others (which are already very distinguished). Of these, the most prized are the Rugiens Hauts, the Rugiens Bas and the three Epenots, in particular the Clos des Epenots.The reputation of Pommard is not only excellent; it is bold and solid. Since the Middle Ages, this wine, of which there are 218 producers today, has been considered the mightiest of the Burgundian reds. This can be seen in its color, which is particularly intense for a wine from this region, as well as its vatting time (maceration in vats, at the beginning of the vinification process), which is longer than that of its neighbors. And above all, in the glass itself, owing to its tannins and its density – very unusual in Burgundies – and a lingering power and structure. This is why it is advisable to wait a good ten years, more if possible, before opening them. These are wines that mature well, allowing for a fuller aromatic bouquet and a softer texture.Faced with this very distinctive identity that contributes to its renown, nowadays you can find finer Pommards, perhaps less destined for lengthy aging but which thrill those who lack patience. Finally, it should be noted that the Pommard appellation should not be confused with the Château de Pommard, a vast estate that produces many other appellations in addition to Pommard.A Pomerol is a red wine from Bordeaux. From the right bank, more precisely between Libourne and Saint-Emilion (Gironde), whose vineyards join each other. As is usual on this bank, the Merlot grape is on show in a Pomerol (80% of the grapes), while the rest is a mixture, depending on the blends, of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and a smidge of Malbec.",/en/travel/
48 hours in Karlsruhe,"    Discover Karl's dream castle, stroll through medieval Durlach, have lunch in the middle of start-ups and dive into the virtual world at the ZKM: in this beautiful German city, less than three hours from Paris, the journey becomes a temporal one. ","If Georges Brassens lived happily by his tree, Charles-Guillaume de Bade-Durlach found inspiration to create his city, Karlsruhe, in the southwest of Germany, only twenty kilometers from France, where Art Nouveau, crocus, red pyramid and castle are in close proximity.7:30 a.m. Gutenberg and falafelThe future belongs to those who get up early, but not too early, if they want to have a coffee on the terrace (in the warmth of a plaid) at the Gutenbergplatz (1) market, which is held on Saturdays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. If it opens at 7:30 am, the surrounding cafes, them, serve only from ... 9 hours. Fallback solution: the coffee stand. But the espresso, it will be standing! Or on a bench in front of the Krautkopfbrunnen, a fountain from the beginning of the 20th century, decorated with nine plump little men carrying a garland of fruit and flowers. Above, a metal structure topped by a cabbage head. The decoration is planted.In this chilly month of March, the stands are few, yet there is nothing missing: organic fruits and vegetables, or not, cheesemaker, butcher, baker, florist, food trucks of Indian cuisine, falafels and ... screening stand Covid-19!9 hours The Red PyramidChange of square, direction Marktplatz (2) where another market is located part of the year - the flower market is held here almost every day. It is the heart of the city center, where the neoclassical town hall (1825) and the evangelical church (1807-1816) with its six Corinthian columns face each other. In the middle, the red sandstone pyramid (1823) stands above the tomb of the founder of Karlsruhe, Karl Wilhelm, Margrave of Baden-Durlach.The Friedrichsplatz (3), where the natural history museum stands, is home to the Christmas market, which is already far away. White and purple crocuses brighten up its flowerbeds, which stretch across the square. A parallel street, the Herrenstrasse, leads to the Federal Court of Justice, the highest court in Germany. For Karlsruhe is ""the"" city of law in Germany. It is also the seat of the Federal Constitutional Court.10:30 a.m. Art Nouveau and MargaritaOn Ludwigsplatz, it is the terraces of restaurants and bars that take their ease. One of them stands out, the Krokodil (4), a ""Jugendstil"" building, German Art Nouveau, with a magnificent almond green facade and windows framed in white, built between 1914 and 1915. Munich's beer flowed freely here. Today, it is rather the margarita.Another Art Nouveau building, at the corner of Kaiserstrasse and Karlstrasse, is worth a visit, the Zum Moninger (1901) - named after a brewer. This palace, decorated with sculptures of mythical Nordic figures, is under construction. Moninger still brews beer.",/en/travel/
"On board the snow train, the Wild West version of Sweden","    The splendors of Orsa Lake, the sauna in the middle of the Asarna woods, the unique light of Östersund... In winter, riding the Snötaget is a way of discovering Sweden from the inside, taking your time. ","A white Wild West, not because of its vastness, but because of its wild nature. Miles of snow-covered pine and fir forests. Frozen lakes as far as the eye can see, the odd house, just a few hills to give a little depth and roundness to the landscape. You have to like repetition to experience this change of scenery, and above all take your time.This is the secret of this journey aboard the Snötaget, the snow train. A journey that begins in Mora, right in the middle of Sweden. It's a small town known for the Vasaloppet, the kingdom's most popular annual cross-country ski race, which follows a course of about 90 kilometers between Malung-Sälen and Mora. It is March, and everything is in place, stands and banners, to welcome the 16,000 skiers and celebrate its 100th anniversary.The resort is teeming with people. Our train is an old red and white carriage, the likes of which you no longer see. It stands out in this landscape, from which modern trains set off for Stockholm. Pelle Björkman is one of its drivers. His gray beard is as long as the years he's spent on the Inlandsbanan. A train from yesteryear that narrowly escaped the sidings. The line was created at the end of the 19th century, in order to open a way of communication  from south and north, in the middle of the wilderness, hence its name: Inlandsbanan, ""the way of the interior.""The line, completed in 1937, experienced difficulties in the 1960s with the advent of the car. It reopened in 2012 thanks to the battle led by the 19 municipalities it served. Since then, the Inlandsbanan has had a seasonal rhythm: in summer, it crosses, from south to north, 1,299 kilometers between Mora and Gällivare in two days; in winter, it transforms into a snow train, the Snötaget, and stops in Östersund, a total of 596 kilometers in one day.We will spend five days aboard the Snötaget. Journey time: a time of idle ambling, when lounging and dreaming are permitted, as well as randomly picking out stations on the map to stop for a night. Ours are called Orsa, Arsana and Östersund. There are about 10 travelers in the train's only carriage. Mélanie and Éloise Warenbourg, two French women, are tracking the northern lights of Abisko in Lapland. In Östersund, they will board another train to reach the Far North. ""I feel like I'm outside of time and it's weird to see faces,"" says Melanie, masks not being mandatory in Sweden.Fredrik Olofsson is a controller who has been working on this line for two months. He gives some instructions and then comments humorously on the landscapes we cross. The train honks curiously at random moments: Pelle Björkman, the driver, tells us that it is to warn the wild animals, the cars and the snowmobiles of our arrival. There are very few barriers, except in Sveg, where the bridge is used by other vehicles. From his cabin, he is proud to show us the black box that allows the barrier to be raised and lowered.",/en/travel/
"A shopping spree, Mac and Cheese with lobster and a majestic river, all in the heart of Old Montréal","    In the historic heart of Old Montréal, an old library was converted into a hotel. The comfortable Room 101 maintains a connection between the city of yesterday and the city of today. ","Adrienne Couture, founder of Maisons & Co, specializes in transforming historic buildings into contemporary accommodations. Before being converted into an apartment hotel, Maison Sainte-Thérèse, located on rue Sainte-Thérèse in Old Montréal, was the oldest library in the city and the meeting place of the local aristocracy.Even though the renovation project required modernizing a good part of the 19th-century building, the original stone walls, shutters and floor were preserved. By giving this historic building a second life, Ms. Couture has rethought the rules of urban hospitality. Here, there is no bellhop or concierge to welcome guests. Everything is digital. A 24-hour hotline allows guests to contact the virtual concierge as well as the cleaning and maintenance team – and a laundry room is available to guests.On the ground floor, Room 101 (there are only 15 rooms) is the perfect example of the hospitable spirit of this particular house. With posters of old exhibitions by Le Corbusier and Henri Matisse and its furniture, either found or created by Montréal designers, it is one of the eight rooms designed by interior designer Sabrina Barazin. The kitchen is (very well) equipped and the living room has a smart TV connected to various platforms such as Netflix. The night area (without windows, unfortunately) is not huge, but it has a real dressing room and ultra-comfortable bedding. This coziness carries through the whole two-room apartment and more generally the entirety of Maison Sainte-Thérèse.You wouldn't expect to find such a place, somewhere between minimalism and austerity, in this busy neighborhood full of restaurants, cafes and souvenir stores. Ssense is a five-story concept store designed by British architect David Chipperfield. It's associated with an online site of designer pieces that bears the same name. By appointment, one can enjoy a tailored shopping spree within these walls (""magasiner"" as the Québécois say). Or have lunch at the gray, concrete-clad Armani Cafe, located right upstairs.Clément, the manager of Sea Salt, a seafood restaurant located opposite the Old Port, comes from another port city, Marseille, and its chef de salle, Gilles, from Montpellier. The duo has a lot to do with the friendly atmosphere at this eatery, which has a terrace - open as soon as the sun allows it, from spring to the beautiful days of autumn. You can enjoy sweet and iodized oysters that come directly from the neighboring province of Prince Edward Island, spaghetti with seafood or a Mac and Cheese with lobster that makes you forget that you are in the kingdom of poutine.",/en/travel/
Going with the flow in Lugano,Feature,"Lugano is the birthplace of the Eurovision Song Contest. But the first song that comes to mind is not Refrain, the winning song in 1956, the contest's first year, but instead lyrics from the French-Italian singer Nino Ferrer: ""On dirait le Sud. Le temps dure longtemps..."" (""It feels like the south. Time lasts a long time..."") It's true that one would love to stay ""more than a million years"" here. The Swiss town in the Ticino canton, nestled at the foot of the Alps and coiled on the edge of a dazzling lake, provides endless opportunities to lose yourself in the horizon, a majestic natural spectacle which reveals itself in real time.The border with Italy flows through the middle of the northern shore of Lake Lugano. As soon as you leave the scarlet train station, you're met with a festival of color: shades of pink, yellow and blue adorn the baroque or neoclassical facades in this city of nearly 65,000 residents. The city's architecture lends the city a Mediterranean charm, right down to the voices you hear in the  streets. Italian is spoken here: one of the four languages used in Switzerland. The turquoise blue or celadon green of the water, depending on the season, completes the picture.Strolling along the promenade that follows the curve of the lake is the best way to enjoy it. Sheltered by a double row of lime and chestnut trees, dotted with red benches, blue deckchairs and orange pedal boats, the lake invites you to stroll from Ciani Park to Paradiso (and then go back again, as you can never get sick of this view).Ciani Park is the former estate of Giacomo and Filippo Ciani, two Milanese bankers and merchants who settled in Lugano in 1833. Flanked by a salmon-pink villa, it spreads over 63,000 square meters and is the meeting place for Sunday strolls between centuries-old oak and maple trees, providing photo opportunities for tourists passing through.Its beach is very popular for watching the sunset. On the opposite side of the lake, Paradiso is a city in its own right, with 5-star hotels, luxurious apartments and a 50-meter-high water jet inaugurated in 2004 for the International Year of Water.To admire this scenery from above, visitors go up the mountains that embrace the city, both accessible on foot: Monte San Salvatore and Monte Brè. Considered the ""sunniest summit in all of Switzerland,"" Monte Brè rises to 928 meters above sea level and can be reached by taking two funiculars. The first, which you can board on Via Pico, opened in 1908 and is automatic. From the platform, the slope looks very, very steep. At least for those who suffer from vertigo, who are told to focus on their feet, even if the trip only lasts five minutes. Whereas everyone else can admire the panorama as soon as it starts to climb. And the best is yet to come.",/en/travel/
French far-right leader seeks to take advantage of AI debate,"    Contrary to his party's conservative position, the president of the Rassemblement National is supporting the creation of European AI champions. ","In an overheated Parisian reception room, before an audience of Members of the European Parliament, writers, and entrepreneurs, a young politician praised artificial intelligence (AI), brushed aside ""the darkest prophecies,"" and, condemning over-regulation, spoke of the urgent need for a European public policy in the sector. Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right party Rassemblement National (RN), has set his sights on artificial intelligence. For the past year, he has emphasized on the importance of ""the other 'great replacement'"", as he calls it in reference to the racist theory which rejects the mixing of populations. Surprisingly, contrasting with the conservative stance in his camp, the young party leader is championing a tech-friendly position.On June 19, Bardella wrapped up a symposium organized in Paris by the Identity & Democracy Foundation (ID), associated with the RN-dominated group in the European Parliament. One of his close friends, the entrepreneur Laurent Alexandre, a passionate advocate of transhumanism – which aims to improve man through technology – and artificial intelligence, was there to deliver opening remarks in the provocative, technophile tone that has made him such a successful writer. One of the voices of French tech, Thomas Fauré, the founder of the ""sovereign collaborative platform"" Whaller, was also present. The rest of the speakers tapped into the European conservative repertoire, which has proved more concerned with the ethical and moral consequences of accelerating AI.For the RN leader, it is both a genuine interest and a political move which speaks more to the upper class than to blue-collar workers. Bardella acknowledged his passion for Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, the best-selling book by Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari, which predicts two possible developments for humanity: In the first, a man empowered by technology; in the second, a takeover of power by specialized AI algorithms.""At 27, he belongs to the digital geek generation. In the political class as a whole, few people are as interested in AI and the future as he is,"" according to Alexandre. Since 2019, the two men have maintained a friendly relationship and regularly have lunch together. The essayist, who supported Macron in 2017 before moving closer to the far right, stressed he was not ""politically aligned with the RN"" although he advocates ""sending illegal immigrants back to Africa by military force"".At an April event organized by the far-right weekly Valeurs Actuelles, Bardella said the ""next great social crisis will arise from ChatGPT [a software capable of sustaining an online conversation],"" urging schools to adapt to a new era rather than ""developing gender studies"". His doctrine seems to have been further clarified since. He sees it now as somewhere between ""naive technophilia and messianism, on the one hand, and, on the other, neo-Luddism, which would seek to curb or even halt all technological progress."" Bardella is convinced society will have to ""come to terms with AI, (...) a great factor of progress and comfort for mankind,"" since, in his view, it could resolve labor shortages in some sectors, such as agriculture or robotics, and cater for stagnating productivity.",/en/pixels/
The people who worry about climate change – but don't want to give up plane travel,"They may be pros at recycling, never forget their tote bag when they go to the supermarket and always buy organic – but the one thing they can't give up are their long-haul flights.","They were among the first to worry about global warming, to rail against SUVs in the city, to buy organic, local-grown vegetables and to be capable of making a 500 meter detour to throw their peelings in the neighborhood composter. But the only habit they haven't managed to kick is air travel. Flight shaming (to make someone else feel guilty for travelling by airplane) hasn't made its mark on them yet. Travel is their ""guilty pleasure,"" they say, the way vegetarians would admit to occasionally lapsing and eating a burger.After all, is it so bad to fly to a European capital for a three-day weekend when you bring your own paper bags and jars to the market to avoid packaging? What can we do if the people who are the most environmentally aware also happen to be travel enthusiasts? They can reel off the list of all the things they've restricted themselves from doing... And just as quickly unroll a string of excuses to justify their next plane trips. Next year, they will fly less, but this year they have children in Erasmus programs to visit. And they are not going to cycle to Palermo for the Ascension holiday!During the Covid-19 pandemic, they enjoyed taking their vacations in France. When they were in Greece for 10 days the next summer, during the time of the fires, they found it incredible that there wasn't more concern about the climate crisis. They have a vague feeling that a rental car only spews out rental CO2. In winter, they find those large advertisements for 39 euro flights environmentally shocking. In spring, they find it economically shocking to have to pay 400-euro round trips. On Instagram, they still post pictures of their vacations, but not those taken from the window of the plane. Who knows, their followers might think they got there by train.""I've been to New York, but because of Covid-19 I hadn't been there in two years."" ""Our daughter almost cancelled her vacation when the IPCC report came out."" ""Still, there are things that you just can't do anymore.""

Walking in the Bregenzerwald and its mountains of the future,"    At Austria's western tip, the Bregenzerwald is a haven for hikers and cyclists in the summer and for skiers in the winter. It also serves as a model of mountain agriculture, where traditional know-how is combined with contemporary design. ","Green as far as the eye can see. Shaped lawns reminscent of golf fairways, where not a single blade sticks out. Scattered here and there are cows, placid chewing the cud in abundant meadows. Large wooden chalets, often covered with flowers, dot the landscape, against a backdrop of forested mountains. And when the green disappears, limestone rock dominates, like the Kanisfluh (2,044 meters), the towering cliff in the village of Au, in the south of Bregenzerwald in Austria.There is an air of perfection along the winding roads and paths of this region of the westernmost state of Vorarlberg. It's a harmony of curves and well-kept gardens: The area is known for the way the landscape is cared for, as well as the opulence of its farms. Here, mountain agriculture does not seem to suffer from the same ills as some Alpine or Pyrenean valleys, weakened as a result of isolating and dividing up farms.This area, with its string of 23 villages, inspires peace. It's tempting to get out into the fresh air and walk through the many hilltop hamlets, such as Au, Krumbach or Schwarzenberg. The beauty of alpine pastures here is a powerful incentive for walking. In Bregenzerwald, there are more than 1,500 kilometers of trails marked out, with about 50 routes that can be completed in a day, from easy to strenuous.Less strenuous, but just as spectacular, are the cable cars that climb the peaks. From Schoppernau, head for the Diedamskopf (2,090 m) in order to see the peaks overlooking the region to the south, the Grosser Widderstein (2,533 m), the Hochkünzelspitze (2,397 m), or the Zitterklapfen (2,403 m). Beyond the meadows, these rugged and crevassed mountains blurred by a haze of heat dominate other peaks and glacial valleys, where rare patches of snow remain.Walk with your nose in the air... Or look at your feet and the wild plants that abound. This is naturalist guide Katharina Moosbrugger's specialty. She takes us to the Fohramoos, an extensive peatland area above the village of Schwarzenberg. Behind a pond of brown residual water, a forest made up of both deciduous and coniferous trees covers soft ground. Further on, a clearing shines in the light. Moss and small flowers grow in the spongy soil. Some are edible, others carnivorous, like the round-leaved sundew. ""In the spring, if you stick your ear to the bark of the birch trees, you can hear the water rising in the trunks. If you make a hole, you can even drink it; it's a detox,"" she said.The Bregenzerwald is a land of nature and wide open spaces, and in winter it is a popular destination for skiers. In the summer, it also offers cyclists and mountain bikers somewhere to indulge their passion, between pass roads, valley trails and great paths. A good reason to abandon the car. Especially since the Bregenzerwald guest card, issued from May to October to all guests staying at least three nights in a hotel, gives free access to public transport. And frequency and punctuality are the rule here.",/en/travel/

Located less than 80 kilometers from Paris, the Eure village beloved by Monet attracts tourists from all over the world. More and more city dwellers looking for a breath of country air have been coming there too, and the large half-timbered building can no longer accommodate all of the visitors who want to stay there.So the chef opened O Plum'Art. These five guest rooms and an apartment are in the former early 20th century home of a milkman, a perfect base to start your visit from. As a tribute to its former resident, the interior is painted the color of milk from floor to ceiling, making the place very soothing. As in the main establishment, the rooms are named after species of chickens, a nod to the birds that peck around the grounds.The Marans apartment is an elegant, immaculate cocoon at the back of the house, on the garden level. Vintage wooden furniture, a bouquet of dried flowers and old books warm the living room overlooking the large lawn. In the bedroom, the bed is on a platform facing a print of Monet's Water Lilies on a television screen on standby – a cliché that makes you smile. The breakfast served on the first floor, near the fireplace, is also something of a good cliché, tasty and comforting: the fallue (Norman brioche) and the bourdelot (local apple turnover), offered with honey from the village and jams prepared by Mr. Gallienne's mother.At the small cemetery located in the yard of the Sainte-Radegonde Church, visitors stroll about, bent over and peering, looking for the grave of Claude Monet, who died in 1926 at the age of 86. The grave is at the back of the Romanesque building, on the right side when looking from the street.

Bologna is a ""red city,"" built of bricks made with locally-available clay.Once introductions are made, you can indulge in a macchiato, a cream-filled croissant and a freshly-squeezed fruit juice in the square of the Porta San Donato, an ancient gate (1) located in the middle of the university district. Take a look: There are two goliardi!

It is never cold or too hot, and the ocean that bathes it is never raging,"" said Jacques Chardonne in Vivre à Madère (""Living in Madeira""), his novel published in 1953.Constrained by the shapes of the local architecture, the Cajú hotel does not really offer an intermediary space between the rooms and the street. Fortunately, because it is ideally located, it invites you to take many walks in this port and island city with wide avenues planted with jacaranda trees and small streets that evoke the bairro alto of Lisbon before excessive tourism. Somewhere between old Europe and the New World, between our temperate latitudes and the tropics, an air of perpetual holidays envelops Funchal.This garden is like an introduction to the hikes on the island, which prides itself on the extraordinary diversity of its flora. Palm trees and dragon trees rub shoulders with the kapok tree (the cotton tree with its high-up white balls), the coral tree with scarlet flowers and the beaucarnea, whose trunk base looks like an elephant's foot. Water jets and flowers in majesty, such as the orange and blue birds of paradise (Strelitzia reginae), contribute to its charm. You can have a drink or lunch on the terrace at the park's café.Madeira differs from port in that it is more acidic. From this volcanic soil, the grapes are cultivated in espaliers (as in France) or in arbors (horizontally) and produce a fortified wine that is 19% alcohol. The Blandy cellars (one of the eight brands of the title) offer an interesting journey through the history and production techniques of Madeira wine and end with an inevitable tasting at the store (where you can also buy bolo de mel, a gingerbread made with sugar cane).",/en/travel/
Chinese airlines buy 292 Airbus planes for $37 billion,"    Chinese airlines have struck a deal to buy 292 Airbus aircraft for $37 billion, a boost for the aviation sector giant as Chinese travel restrictions ease ","Four Chinese airlines said Friday, July 1, they will buy a total of 292 planes from Airbus in a $37 billion windfall for the aviation giant, as the industry rebuilds after the coronavirus pandemic. The orders come after a bumper year for Airbus, which posted record profits in 2021 after a two-year pandemic slump, giving the company a further boost over US rival Boeing.China Eastern said Friday it had agreed to purchase 100 A320neo jets and China Southern said on the same day that it would buy 96 of the same model. Air China and its subsidiary Shenzhen Airlines also confirmed the purchase of a combined 96 A320neo planes, according to separate filings.Airbus said in a statement Friday that the deals showed ""the positive recovery momentum and prosperous outlook for the Chinese aviation market."" It said the deals ""brought to conclusion these long and extensive discussions that have taken place throughout the difficult Covid pandemic.""Boeing's business in China − one of the world's largest aviation markets − was hit in recent years by uncertainty over its 737 MAX planes, which were suspended from use in the country after deadly crashes in 2019. Chinese authorities finally gave the go-ahead for the 737 MAX to resume service last year after making a series of safety adjustments.In March this year, a Boeing 737-800 crashed in the southern province of Guangxi, killing 132 people in China's worst air disaster in decades.China's travel industry has been hammered by the country's stringent zero-Covid policy, which has imposed sweeping lockdowns often over just a handful of cases and weighed on the economy and consumer confidence.The country's international borders were shut in March 2020 and the number of international flights is still tightly restricted in an effort to tamp down ""imported"" virus cases. But there were hopes of some relaxation in the policy this week after Beijing said it would cut the length of mandatory quarantine for inbound travelers − the biggest easing of entry restrictions yet after sticking to a rigid zero-Covid policy throughout the pandemic.Air China on Friday said its latest purchase would ""optimize fleet structure and supplement capacity in the long term."" China also has high hopes for developing its own aircraft manufacturing industry, with attention focused on Comac's C919 narrow-body plane, a potential rival to Airbus and Boeing aircraft.",/en/travel/
City of Paris museums announce new season focusing on female artists,"    The 14 institutions, which attracted more visitors in 2021-2022 than before the pandemic, have announced a new season focused on female creators. ","""The City of Paris museums are doing well!"" It is with this more than positive assessment that Carine Rolland, deputy mayor of Paris in charge of culture, celebrated the success of the 2021-2022 season that is coming to an end. After two years affected by the pandemic and restricted cultural life, the exhibitions and collections of the 14 Parisian museums attracted more than 2.2 million visitors in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, visitor numbers even exceeded those of the same period in 2019. This achievement can be explained by exhibits that are ""demanding, ambitious and accessible to all,"" said Carine Rolland.Paris Musées is not content to rest on its laurels, however. For its 2022-2023 program, which will begin in September, the capital's museums have decided to pay tribute to female creators – visual artists, photographers and actresses – through exhibitions on a variety of themes. ""We want to give them visibility because they are above all great artists, some of them forgotten,"" said Ms. Rolland. ""Paris Musées wants to participate in this women's emancipation movement that is currently taking place in our society.""The Musée de la Vie Romantique has already begun this with its temporary exhibition ""Héroïnes Romantiques,"" which began on April 6 and will end on September 4. To continue this theme, between April and September 2023, the museum will invite the French visual artist Françoise Pétrovitch, little known to the general public, to display her work throughout the institution. From the house to the workshops and garden, the museum will offer a journey around the artist's paintings, sculptures and drawings. ""What remains of romanticism in contemporary art today?"" asked Gaëlle Rio, the director. Two themes will be honored: nature and the feeling of love communicated by a couple's unspoken words and uncertainties. Several pieces will be created for the occasion and displayed to the public for the first time.At the Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris, the focus on female creators will be twofold. Starting on March 31 and running through July 16, 2023, the museum will host a retrospective dedicated to the Franco-Norwegian painter Anna-Eva Bergman. ""There is a kind of secrecy around her work because she is a woman,"" said Fabrice Hergott, the director. ""Today, her talent begs to be reconsidered."" While the museum had already celebrated her in 1977, this artist, a key figure in post-war painting, is back in the rooms devoted to major historical exhibitions, with over 200 works (paintings, graphic arts, manuscripts and archives). In collaboration with the Fondation Hartung-Bergman, the exhibition will shed light on her work, which is characterized by a pictorial language inspired by Nordic landscapes and mythologies.",/en/travel/
"L'Elixir d'Or, a treasure hunt for lovers of riddles and wine","Since April 11, the hunt is on. Whoever is able to solve the riddles will bag not a trophy, but 3,500 delicious vintages. To take part in this game promoting the French wine heritage, only two criteria are required: being of legal drinking age and perseverance.","From now on, wine can expand your mind without you having to go through a hangover. And the best part is that everyone loves it. The puzzle is called L'Elixir d'Or (""The Golden Elixir"") and it's a treasure hunt, a real one, with a scroll full of riddles and a chest buried somewhere in France.I wanted to know if the fantasy of becoming a treasure-seeking explorer only speaks to an immature and dreamy category of people, of which I am an incorrigible member. So, I chose a panel of serious – and vaguely grumpy – adults with unmistakable wisdom: Le Monde's newsroom. The effect was quite comical: As soon as I unrolled the scroll, my audience, whose eyes suddenly lit up like flashlights, announced a six-month unpaid leave of absence to devote themselves to solving these riddles. It took a reminder from management that the print deadline was in one hour to bring this rowdy crowd back to reality. Actually, journalists are hopelessly curious. But we must admit that the prize, 3,500 bottles worth an estimated €100,000, is good bait. I will come back to this.Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this wine-based treasure hunt lies in its roots. L'Elixir d'Or was directly inspired by the book On the Trail of the Golden Owl, a treasure hunt launched in 1993 and still unsolved to this day. It has obsessed some 200,000 ""owl-hunters"". A few months after its launch, French journalist Florence Aubenas – now working at Le Monde – accompanied some explorers on their hunt and wrote about them in an article for French newspaper Libération. The game was designed by Max Valentin (who died in 2009) and illustrated by Michel Becker. Eighteen months ago, Becker – who also sculpted the reward, a solid silver owl statuette covered with gold and diamonds – went to check that the treasure had not been found yet. This mythical quest, turning 30 this year, continues to drive theories, forums, and sales of shovels and compasses.Etienne Picand, 25, continues his search. He shares his progress and the different possibilities he explores on a YouTube channel. It's in his blood. Besides, as he announced right away, he is the son and grandson of treasure hunters and is keeping the family passion alive. He is the one who, with his brother Guillaume, created the six riddles that make up L'Elixir d'Or. He spent a year working on them and estimates that it will take at least six months to solve them, or even maybe a year or two. It's impossible to know in advance. But he thinks that if no one has found the buried chest by 2029, he will drop some hints.",/en/lifestyle/
Dive into the Grands Crus: Five vineyards where visitors can also spend the night,"    'Le Monde' invites you to travel. This week, a review of five estates where you can relax after your wine tasting, from Bordeaux to Provence, through the Loire Valley, Burgundy and Champagne. ","Discovering exceptional wines and champagnes without having to hit the road again, while treating yourself to a spa, an immersive experience, a local menu – it's possible again, and also affordable. For a change of scenery while pleasing your palate, and much more, follow the guide!Les Sources de Caudalie is the absolute stalwart in wine tourism in the Bordeaux region, and a pioneer, too. The place boasts impressive assets: Only 15 kilometers south of Bordeaux, it's nestled in the vineyards of Château Smith Haut Lafitte, an icon of Pessac-Léognan wines. This authentic hamlet with traditional Aquitaine architecture houses three restaurants and a spa (with the famous Caudalie treatments made from grape extracts). The estate also offers the possibility of bike rides in the vineyard or in the 8-hectare forest next to it, dotted with land art. You can drink the estate's wines and eat the vegetables from the garden. From swimming pools to cooking classes to the château's barrel-making facility to boat trips, it's impossible to get bored.The idea is certainly absurd. But with a small dose of humor and a laid-back attitude, it has its charm: Put yourself in a grape's shoes and spend the night sleeping in a barrel on a wine estate. No maceration or fermentation on the schedule, but just country comfort with a camping theme. (You can either bring your own comforter or rent a sleeping kit.)The concept was thought up  by the federation of independent winegrowers of the Pays de la Loire. And it was put into practice here, 15 minutes from Nantes, in the town of Thouaré-sur-Loire (western France) on the river. The small 3.5-hectare vineyard produces three vintages, two whites (Muscadet and Coteaux d'Ancenis) and a light red, as well as sparkling grape juice. The Marchais estate also owns surrounding vineyards and offers many other vintages for tasting.Burgundian winemakers are sometimes criticized for keeping their doors closed. Jean-Louis Trapet, one of the most respected winemakers of Gevrey-Chambertin (and even of the whole Côte de Nuits), has therefore decided to set up a guest house.",/en/travel/
"At Off-White, Ibrahim Kamara has the makings of a designer",Profile,"Arriving at the Tennis Club in Paris on March 2 for the Off-White fall-winter 2023-2024 fashion show, guests took their seats in a setting covered in ochre dirt. Here, however, there was no hint of a court to work on your backhand. It was the arid soil of Sierra Leone, his native country, that Ibrahim Kamara, the brand's new art and image director, wanted to evoke. Memories of the shanty town on the Atlantic Ocean where he grew up speaking Krio have also influenced his designs.The mossy expanses mutated into green knitted vests or jacquard coats; the tired sheet metal or the rough concrete into tie-dye dresses. And the beloved annual parade, a ""sort of carnival"" where his mother took him from the age of 4, emerges quietly in a look, one of the strongest of the show: an eggplant and orange jacket and Bermuda shorts ensemble, in a sporty-couture style, zipped up but entirely embroidered with beads.For the hard-working 33-year-old, this show was the first one he was able to oversee fully as a clothing designer. And this comes after a decade spent exercising his talents as a stylist, that is to say, staging and composing looks with pieces designed by others, both for major houses and fashion magazines (System, W and Vogue, but also M Le magazine du Monde, with which he occasionally collaborates). It has been a lightning-fast rise that he evokes without any pessimism, ears pricked with unsuspecting pink flower-shaped earrings. ""The truth is that I was not aware of our poverty. I had a happy childhood. I would play outside at night until 10 pm. I would draw.""Some 30 years later, here is Kamara – who goes by ""Ib"" – tasked with one of the most challenging missions in the contemporary fashion industry: building legitimacy as a designer, with no prior design experience, and at the helm of the label founded by the American designer Virgil Abloh, a prolific and iconoclastic jack-of-all-trades who was appointed as the head of men's fashion for Louis Vuitton in 2018 and died from cancer in 2021, at age 41. In his soft-spoken voice, the successor said that he didn't hesitate about taking the job for even a second: ""It's a lot of responsibility, but the kind I treasure."" After all, who knew Abloh's ""way of thinking"" better than he did? his defenders pleaded.In 2020, ""V,"" as he called Virgil, solicited him directly via Instagram to offer him a job helping him as a stylist, both at Off-White and at Louis Vuitton – since July 2021 the LVMH group has been a majority shareholder with 60% of Off-White. He had to pair the right jacket with the right pants, putting together a look that contains that electrifying and photogenic je-ne-sais-quoi.",/en/lifestyle/
"'The Killer,' on Netflix: A lone killer with a meticulous routine","    Much like its protagonist, a professional hitman who must eliminate his employers to save his own skin, David Fincher's film is straightforward and impactful in its storytelling. ","For those expecting him to have created a new fictional labyrinth (Zodiac, The Social Network) or mental trap (Fight Club, Gone Girl) with a complex architecture in the purest Neo-hitchcockian tradition, David Fincher's latest feature is likely to be disconcerting. Based on a French comic strip by Matz and Luc Jacamon (The Killer), The Killer is a simple, one-shot film that goes straight to the point, moving from one stage to the next while avoiding digressions and pretense. With this film, Fincher makes a detour into B-movies as someone who would go on a strict diet, returning to his roots with the dry efficiency he was known for in his early 90s days.A lone gunman (Michael Fassbender) stationed on the top floor of a building under construction in Paris is waiting for his target, only to miss the crucial moment when it arrives. Those who ordered the hit turn against him, and he's forced to move one step ahead of them and work his way up the chain – henchmen, associates and principals, right up to the client – to take them out one by one and save his own skin while traveling to several countries in the process. From the outset, Fincher parallels this straightforward premise to the streaming platform's flow logic with boilerplate (and very anti-cinematographic) opening credits that resemble those of a police TV series like CSI: Miami (2000-2015).Even more than as an expertise, the film presents the assassin's process as a routine broken up into a series of strict rules. It uses voice-over to capture the shooter's inner monologue, a series of solemn maxims uttered in a cynical tone, which, by pretending to hold sway over chance, reveals a certain hubris, as the man gladly counts himself among the elite and uses cold-hearted statistics to justify his actions. As the only way to gain access to this silent and clandestine protagonist, this commentary mainly reveals his isolation and self-imposed solitude. Even more than the raw action (including a hard-hitting brawl in Florida), the camera follows the many phases of his careful preparation and solitary waiting, which consist of melting into anonymity and disappearing into the very heart of the world – most of his activity being dormant.The gunman's voice-over is sometimes contradicted by pesky facts and a recalcitrant reality. Rather than exploring this irony, Fincher falls back on the hero's professionalism, mirroring his mastery with his direction. With dry pans, steady dollies and snap cuts – an aesthetic arsenal infatuated with its terse efficiency – the character is like a skeleton key that knows how to exploit the weak links of a techno-digital modernity where excessive information has become a new way to blur the lines. As a man in tune with his hero's hyper-competence, merely a reflection of his own, Fincher offers an ode to the ""craft"" by example. By modernizing a B-movie, a revelation emerges: The filmmaker's touch is as much about know-how as it is about its immediate flip side, namely a polished and somewhat frigid form of hygienics.",/en/culture/
Fashion becomes art: Karl Lagerfeld and Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel from every angle,"    Karl Lagerfeld in New York this spring, Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel in London in September. Beyond their charismatic personalities, two exhibitions chose to focus on their creations. ","Hasn't everything already been said about Karl Lagerfeld and Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel? Evidently not. Despite an abundance of literature and films on these two subjects, two exhibitions intend to explore them in greater depth. Through July 16, ""Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty"" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met) in New York presents over 150 garments created by the designer for Chanel, Fendi, Chloé and his own label during his prolific career that lasted from the 1950s until his death in February 2019. As for Gabrielle Chanel, the 2020 exhibition dedicated to her by the Palais Galliera in Paris continues to travel around the world: After Tokyo and Melbourne, it will be presented in London's Victoria and Albert Museum starting September 16.In both exhibitions, the curators' intentions are the same: Shine a light on their work, which was often overshadowed by their charismatic personalities. ""Karl Lagerfeld created an Andy Warhol-like caricature of himself that allowed him to appear in the spotlight. We spent a lot of time dissecting his bons mots and his attitude. What I was interested in was to show his creative process,"" explained the Met's curator Andrew Bolton.Bolton got the idea for the exhibition during the memorial service that followed Lagerfeld's death, when he saw a video of Chanel's first studio assistant explaining how she transposed the drawings the designer sent her into 3D models. Digging through the abundant archives, Bolton said he was struck by Lagerfeld's consistency in constructing silhouettes based on oppositions: feminine/masculine, romantic/military, rococo/classical, historical/futuristic, floral/geometric, the list continued. ""Resolving dichotomies, that was what his work was all about,"" Bolton explained.This process of detaching the character in order to investigate the true working methods connects with the exhibition centered on Gabrielle Chanel at the Palais Galliera: ""Over a hundred biographies have been written on her, and most of them talk about her private life. Few talk about clothing. We wanted to go beyond the legend, tell the story of her technique as a dressmaker and the modernity of her work,"" explained Miren Arzalluz. The Palais Galliera's director and curator of the exhibition also tried to erase every personal aspect of Coco Chanel's life and show how the designer considered elegance inseparable from comfort – a very unusual concept at the time that partly explains the success of her brand.",/en/lifestyle/
"José Sébéloué, tender voice of 80's French band La Compagnie Créole, has died","    The singer from French Guiana, co-founder of the festive hit band, died in Paris on Sunday, aged 74. ","It is still hard to find a wedding or birthday party in France where José Sébéloué's voice does not resonate. Along with Clémence Bringtown, he was the lead singer, and guitarist, of La Compagnie Créole, the band behind a series of hits (""Vive le douanier Rousseau,"" ""C'est bon pour le moral,"" ""Le Bal masqué,"" ""Ça fait rire les oiseaux"") that have been an undeniable part of the country's collective memory since the 1980s. Sébéloué, 74, died in Paris on Sunday, September 3.Born on September 17, 1948, in Ouanary, French Guiana, Sébéloué began his musical career with a local band, Pop-Corn, before founding La Compagnie Créole in 1975 with Bringtown, Julien Tarquin, Guy Bevert and Arthur Apatout, musicians from the Martinique and Guadeloupe regions he had met in Paris. The crew adapted traditional tunes from the West Indian repertoire in a unique way until they crossed paths with Parisian Daniel Vangarde and Belgium's Jean Kluger in the early 1980s.At the time, the pair made a name for itself in the Latin disco vein, signing hits with musicians from the Martinique (Gibson Brothers) and Guadeloupe (the Ottawan duo). A passionate fan of tropical music, Vangarde – the father of Daft Punk co-founder Thomas Bangalter – first produced an album of traditional biguine songs for La Compagnie, Blogodo (1982), all sung in Creole.Success came a year later when, between sessions with disco star Amii Stewart, the Franco-Belgian producer's duo got the band to record a version of ""C'est bon pour le moral,"" a song by Vangarde that had not found any takers. Before literally triumphing – thanks in particular to its airing on French television – the disco zouk color given by the musicians initially struggled to seduce radio stations. ""Roger Kreicher, RTL's program director, had told me contemptuously: 'This is ballroom music,'"" Vangarde recalled in an interview with Le Monde last year, adding he had answered back: ""You couldn't please me more.""""The song had a bit of trouble getting off the ground,"" Kluger later said. ""The band then started working on a new single, 'Vive le Douanier Rousseau' when they were selected to represent France at Eurovision in 1983."" La Compagnie Créole came second in the contest, enabling the band to continue working on ""C'est bon pour le moral,"" which eventually made its way onto the airwaves. It was soon followed by ""Vive le douanier Rousseau,"" ""Le Bal masqué,"" ""Ça fait rire les oiseaux,"" and ""Bons baisers de Fort-de-France,"" all of which benefited from late business magnate Francis Bouygues' passion for the band. In his position as owner of French television TF1, he managed to have the musicians appear 36 times on ""Sacrée Soirée,"" an emblematic Saturday evening show in France in the 1980s.",/en/obituaries/
"Dominique Colonna, former France goalkeeper, dies aged 95",    The Corsican who played for Stade de Reims was one of last surviving members of France's squad at the 1958 World Cup. ,"Dominique Colonna, one of the last surviving members of the France squad that reached the semi-finals of the 1958 World Cup, has died aged 95, his former club Stade de Reims announced on Tuesday, September 12.Colonna won 13 caps for France, making his debut against Iceland in 1957 and his final appearance against Spain four years later. In the middle of that span he travelled to Sweden with a France team that boasted the legendary Just Fontaine who scored 13 goals, still a record for a single World Cup tournament.Colonna, however, who was unusually short for a goalkeeper at 1.72 metres did not play a single game at the tournament as Claude Abbes was first choice. With Colonna's death, Robert Mouynet and Bernard Chiarelli remain the only living members of that squad.Born in 1928, Colonna grew up in Corte in Corsica before joining Nice on the French mainland and played six seasons at Reims between 1957-1963, winning the French top flight three times. He was also between the posts for Reims during their 2-0 European Cup final defeat to Real Madrid back in 1959, saving a penalty from Madrid legend Alfredo di Stefano.""He was as intrepid on the pitch as he was charming and witty off it,"" Reims president Jean-Pierre Caillot said. ""He made up for his modest height with his astonishing reflexes and his nerves of steel, in a way he inspired the following generations,"" he said.After hanging up his own boots he became the first coach of newly-independent Cameroon in 1963.",/en/obituaries/
"The death of Giorgio Napolitano, former communist and Italian president","    The tireless activist who started off as a communist and played a leading role in the life of Italian politics died on September 22 at the age of 98. A symbol of stability and political longevity, he remained president for nine years. ","Giorgio Napolitano, the 11th president of the Italian Republic from 15 May 2006 to 14 January 2015, born on 29 June 1925 in Naples, died on September 22, 2023. He was 98 years old. From the heights of the Quirinal, the seat of the presidency, he dominated both the city of Rome and the country's political life. He accompanied, and sometimes led, its transformations as five presidents of the Council succeeded each other in the Chigi Palace, the seat of the presidency of the Council: Romano Prodi (2006-2008), Silvio Berlusconi (2008-2011), Mario Monti (2011-2013), Enrico Letta (2013-2014) and Matteo Renzi (2014-2016).He managed to turn an institutional mandate with a more symbolic than real power into a moral magisterium at a time when the financial crisis that began in 2008 and Silvio Berlusconi's sexual escapades were threatening to ruin Italy's reputation for good.A man with an old-fashioned and sometimes pompous language, an intellectual respected by his peers, a theater and literature lover, he became close to Neapolitan communist circles in his youth after briefly flirting with fascist-inspired movements. Once peace returned, he joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and became its national secretary for the provinces of Naples and Salerno. After graduating in law and writing a thesis on the Mezzogiorno's ""lack of industrial development,"" he was elected MP for the first time in 1953, a mandate he would keep until 1996.At the same time, he climbed the ranks of the PCI, then led by Palmiro Togliatti, and joined its central committee in 1956. Perfectly in line with the party, he supported the Soviet intervention in Hungary, which, according to him, had not only ""saved the country from chaos but contributed to world peace."" ""My story,"" he explained in 2009, ""has gone through decisive changes due to the international and national reality and through profound and assumed personal revisions.""This metamorphosis led him to seek points of convergence with the Socialist Party. The death of Togliatti in 1964, while he was spending his vacations in Crimea was a chance for Napolitano to free himself from his tutelage and to make his membership to the PCI's moderate wing public. Luigi Longo, who became secretary-general, made him his number two. But it was his role as the man responsible for the PCI's cultural policy between 1969 and 1975 that gradually gave him the visibility he needed to assert himself.As party spokesman, he was also in charge of relations with the Andreotti government between 1976 and 1979. A reformist Communist capable of dialogue with the leaders of the Christian Democracy as well as with the trade unions and a convinced European, he took part in numerous international congresses in Europe and forged ties with left-wing leaders like Willy Brandt in Germany. In 1978, he became the first member of the PCI to receive a travel visa for the United States.Having become an assertive social democrat, he sided with the ""migliorists"" communists who sought to improve the working class's lot without bringing down capitalism. He condemned the Soviet Union's intervention in Afghanistan. In contrast with then PCI secretary general Enrico Berlinguer, who was wary of opening up to the Socialist Party, Napolitano maintained his reformist line and warned against the risk of ""isolation"" and ""sectarianism.""As head of the foreign policy committee, he pushed the party to declare itself in favor of ""total loyalty"" to the United States and NATO. He also led it to nuance its almost automatic support for the Palestinian cause. It was around this time that Henry Kissinger said of him: ""He is my favorite communist!"" His transformation ended in 1984 with the death of Berlinguer. Unable to succeed him, he gradually relinquished his responsibilities within the PCI, which ultimately dissolved in 1991. ""The PCI was too slow to transform itself into a social-democratic party with a European vocation,"" he said. From now on, Napolitano's career would evolve within the institutions of the Italian Republic.He became president of the Chamber of Deputies in 1992 during the Tangentopoli investigation (a vast financing and corruption network). His tenure was marked with two feats that earned him the support of both his peers and public opinion. He used the Parliament's inviolability to oppose the judges who were investigating the corruption networks between elected officials and contractors but forced elected officials to vote with their faces uncovered when they were asked to remove one of their own so that he may be prosecuted.He also severed his ties with Socialist Party secretary Bettino Craxi, who was convicted of corruption and died in exile in Hammamet, Tunisia, in 2000. Napolitano was once again an ordinary MP when Silvio Berlusconi came to power in 1994 and was appointed interior minister in 1996 in Romano Prodi's first government. He was responsible for the law creating temporary detention centers for undocumented immigrants that is still in effect.Following the fall of the government, he found refuge in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2006, taking the chair of the influential Committee on Constitutional Affairs. In 2005, President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi appointed him Senator for life. The road to the Quirinal now lay open. On May 10, 2006, Napolitano was elected President of the Republic in the fourth round of voting. He was the first – and to this day the only – politician from the communist ranks to ever reach this position.While the role may seem symbolic despite the president being the head of the army, the guarantor of the nation's institutions and unity, its importance and influence largely depend on the circumstances in which it is exercised and the personalities with whom the head of state must deal. He could have been a debonair president like Sandro Pertini (1978-1985) or a combative one like Oscar Luigi Scalfaro (1992-1999), who opened hostilities with Silvio Berlusconi as soon as he was appointed President of the Council in 1994.Napolitano chose a third way. His apparent simplicity, his uneventful life with his wife Clio – with whom he has two sons – and his presence in the stands of the Berlin stadium in 2006 for the national soccer team's fourth World Cup title brought him closer to the Italian people, although no one would imagine tapping his shoulder. Berlusconi's third election to the presidency of the Council in 2008 was his chance to make full use of his evasiveness and soft touch.Everything opposed the two men: their style, origins and vision of the state. Two Italies confronted each other. While Berlusconi spiraled into scandals, worrying his European partners and the markets who considered him unfit to lead the country during a crisis, Napolitano was a reassuring presence, receiving heads of state and ambassadors at the Quirinal Palace and making numerous trips to Europe. He did not clash with his capricious President of the Council, except on rare occasions when the latter questioned his impartiality, at which time he would sidestep him and prepare the next steps.He came under criticism for engaging with Mario Monti, the future President of the Council from 2011, long before his predecessor was forced to resign. In 2013, after the parliamentarians seeking an elusive majority following the February general elections begged him to run for a second term, he succeeded in imposing Enrico Letta in the Chigi Palace. An expert in power relations educated by decades of political life, he knew this solution could only be temporary. Taking due note of Matteo Renzi's all-powerful hold over the center-left Democratic Party, he let him do as he pleased – and may have encouraged him to take over the presidency of the Council in 2014.Believing the country to be in good hands and convinced reforms ensuring Italy's governability (new voting system, end of bicameralism) would be carried out, he resigned on January 14, 2015, from his position as President of the Republic after a ninth speech to the Italians during the traditional end-of-year television address. He justified his decision by his age, which no longer allowed him to fully perform his function. Senior Christian Democrat Sergio Mattarella has replaced him and began his term in office in a very discreet manner before circumstances, much like his predecessor, pushed him to embrace his role as guardian of institutions threatened by the rise of anti-system rhetoric and Euroscepticism.Napolitano will then continue to seat at the Palazzo Madama for several years as a senator, receiving Italian and foreign officials who came to consult him from afar and with the utmost discretion, before his visits became increasingly infrequent due to his age. And so it was in the guise of an oracle that he ended a political career spanning over more than half a century, during which the ""red prince,"" the nickname of his beginnings, transformed, for the vast majority of Italians, into ""King Giorgio.""June 29, 1925 Born in Naples1945 Joins the Italian Communist Party (PCI)1969-1975 In charge of the PCI's cultural policy1992-1994 President of the Chamber of Deputies1996-1998 Minister of the Interior2006-2015 President of the RepublicSeptember 22, 2023 Death at the age of 98",/en/obituaries/
Former Italian President Giorgio Napolitano dies at 98,"    Premier Giorgia Meloni, whose far-right party is at the opposite end of the political spectrum of the late president, expressed condolences in the name of her government. ","A statement issued Friday, September 22, 2023, by the presidential palace in Rome confirmed Italian news reports of the death of Giorgio Napolitano, who had been ailing in a hospital in the capital for weeks.  The current president, Sergio Mattarella, in a message, hailed his predecessor as head of state, saying that Napolitano's life ""mirrored a large part of (Italy's) history in the second half of the 20th century, with its dramas, its complexity, its goals, its hopes.""In a condolence telegram to Napolitano's widow, Clio, Pope Francis said the late president ""showed great gifts of intellect and sincere passion for Italian political life as well as strong interest for the fates of nations"" The pontiff, who is on a pilgrimage to France, noted he had had personal meetings with Napolitano, ""during which I appreciated his humanity and long-range vision in assuming with rectitude important choices, especially in delicate moments for the life of the country""Napolitano was the first former Communist to rise to Italy's presidency and the first person to be elected twice to the mostly ceremonial post. As a prominent member of what had long been the largest Communist party in the West, Napolitano had advocated positions that often veered from party orthodoxy. He sought dialogue with Italian and European socialists to end his party's isolation and as an early backer of European integration.During the first Gulf War, Napolitano broke with the position of the leader of the Italian Communist Party to oppose the withdrawal of Italy's tiny contingent. That amounted to a radical evolution for a Communist politician, who at the time of the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary had hailed the suppression as necessary. Ultimately, his political reputation was shaped by his reformist views: After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Napolitano was among the staunchest supporters of his party's reform path, which would eventually lead to changing its name and dropping the hammer-and-sickle symbol.Like many other future politicians of his generation, Napolitano fought against the Italian Fascists and Nazi occupiers during World War II. When the war ended, he joined the Communist Party, and in 1953, he was elected to Parliament, an office he would hold for 10 straight legislatures. In 1989, he went to the United States with the party secretary for the first-ever visit by an Italian Communist leader.During his long career, Napolitano also served as speaker of Parliament's lower Chamber of Deputies and for five years as a lawmaker in the European Parliament. In 2005, his predecessor in the Quirinal palace, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, conferred on him one of Italy's greatest honors, making him a senator-for-life. A year later, Parliament would make him president of Italy, the first former Communist – and so far the only one – to serve as head of state.Admirers praised Napolitano's balanced attitude and gentlemanly ways. He was sometimes dubbed ""King Giorgio."" But critics pointed to what they saw as excessive caution. Still, when at the end of his first, seven-year term as head of state, bickering lawmakers couldn't reach a consensus on his successor, he broke with tradition and agreed to be elected to a second term – with the proviso that he wouldn't serve a full term due to advancing age. He was then 80.Napolitano resigned in January 2015, paving the way for Mattarella, a former Christian Democrat, to be elected. Mattarella would go on to be twice elected to the presidency, again after renewed political gridlock in Parliament thwarted the election of a fresh candidate in 2022.",/en/obituaries/
Colombian artist Fernando Botero dies aged 91,"    Considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, the Colombian artist was most famous for his voluptuous figures. His death was announced on Friday. ","Colombia's most famous artist, Fernando Botero, who was known for his voluptuous depictions of people and animals, has died aged 91, President Gustavo Petro announced on Friday, September 15.Botero's works of plump and slightly surreal forms became enormously popular and were on display in museums and public spaces in cities around the world, including Bogota, Madrid, Paris, Singapore and Venice.""Fernando Botero, the painter of our traditions and defects, the painter of our virtues, has died,"" the president posted on social media.Botero's hometown, Medellin, declared a week of mourning, with Mayor Daniel Quintero saying his works on display in that city ""will live forever."" Local media hailed Botero as the greatest Colombian artist of all time, reporting his health had deteriorated in recent days as he suffered pneumonia.Botero – who had been dubbed the ""Picasso of Latin America"" – was a passionate and tireless artist, his oeuvre of more than 3,000 paintings and 300 sculptures proof of an insatiable appetite to create.Even in his later years, he said he was working 10 hours a day. ""I work more now perhaps because I know that there is so little time left,"" he said an interview with Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 2012, the year of his 80th birthday. ""I often think about death and it saddens me to leave this world and not be able to paint more. I love it so much.""Botero was drawn to art at a young age and by 15 was selling his paintings of bulls and matadors at the La Macarena bullfighting ring in Colombia's second-largest city, Medellin, where he was born on April 19, 1932, the son of a modest travelling salesman.After a first solo exhibition in the capital Bogota in the 1950s, Botero left for Europe, travelling to Spain, France and Italy, where he discovered classical art.He moved on to Mexico, becoming influenced by its muralists, and then to New York in 1960, arriving with ""$200 in my pocket"", he said in the 2012 interview.It was there that he met a German art curator who organized triumphant exhibitions in Germany in the 1970s, launching his name. ""I went from being a complete unknown without even a New York gallery to being contacted by the biggest merchants in the world,"" he said.The trademark oversized dimensions of his work emerged in 1957 in his painting ""Still Life with Mandolin"". He discovered ""a new dimension that was more voluminous, more monumental, more extravagant, more extreme.""An admirer of Italian Renaissance art, he did not accept the interpretation that his subjects are fat. ""If I paint a woman, a man, a dog or a horse, I always do with this idea of the volume. It is not that I have an obsession with fat women,"" he said in an interview with daily Spanish newspaper El Mundo in 2014.Sculpture became a major component of his work, developed at a renowned Italian center of sculpture, Pietrasanta.Botero said he was inspired by beauty but also the troubles of his native country, gripped by armed conflict for more than 50 years.In 1995 a powerful bomb placed at his sculpture ""The Bird"" in Medellin killed around 30 people and wounded scores. Botero in 2000 donated a replica to stand beside the exploded sculpture and called ""Bird of Peace"".Some of his work portrays scenes of Colombian guerrilla fighters, earthquakes and brothels. In a departure, he produced in the 2000s a series depicting abuse and torture at the US-run Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, saying afterward he was driven by shock and anger.""Themes of power and excess are not entirely new to Mr. Botero's seemingly sunny art,"" The New York Times said in a 2006 review. ""His evocations of obesity itself imply a sinister cluelessness.""Married three times, his last bride being Greek artist Sophia Vari, Botero had four children, one of whom died in an accident aged four.",/en/obituaries/
Scottish-born actor David McCallum dies at 90,"    McCallum, who became a teen heartthrob in the hit series 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' in the 1960s – and was the eccentric medical examiner in the popular 'NCIS' 40 years later – passed in New York on Monday, September 25, 2024. ","""David was a gifted actor and author, and beloved by many around the world. He led an incredible life, and his legacy will forever live on through his family and the countless hours on film and television that will never go away,"" said a statement from CBS, announcing the actor's passing on Monday, September 25. He died of natural causes, surrounded by family, at New York Presbyterian Hospital.David McCallum had been doing well appearing in such films A Night to Remember, The Great Escape, and The Greatest Story Ever Told (in which he played the role of the apostle Judas). But it was The Man From U.N.C.L.E. that made the blond actor with the Beatlesque haircut a household name in the mid-'60s.The show, which debuted in 1964, starred Robert Vaughn as Napoleon Solo, an agent in a secretive, high-tech squad of crime fighters whose initials stood for United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. Despite the Cold War, the agency had an international staff, with McCallum as Illya Kuryakin, Solo's Russian sidekick. The role was relatively small at first, McCallum recalled, adding in a 1998 interview that ""I'd never heard of the word ‘sidekick' before."" The show drew mixed reviews but eventually caught on, particularly with teenage girls attracted by McCallum's good looks and enigmatic, intellectual character. By 1965, Illya was a full partner to Vaughn's character and both stars were mobbed during personal appearances. The series lasted until 1968. Vaughn and McCallum reunited in 1983 for a nostalgic TV movie, The Return of the Man From U.N.C.L.E., in which the agents were lured out of retirement to save the world once more.McCallum returned to television in 2003 in another series with an agency known by its initials – CBS' NCIS. He played Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard, a bookish pathologist for the Naval Criminal Investigation Service, an agency handling crimes involving the Navy or the Marines. Mark Harmon played the NCIS boss. McCallum said he thought Ducky, who sported glasses and a bow tie and had an eye for pretty women, ""looked a little silly, but it was great fun to do."" He took the role seriously, too, spending time in the Los Angeles coroner's office to gain insight into how autopsies are conducted.McCallum's work with U.N.C.L.E. brought him two Emmy nominations, and he got a third as an educator struggling with alcoholism in a 1969 Hallmark Hall of Fame drama called Teacher, Teacher.",/en/obituaries/
Cosa Nostra boss and once most wanted man in Italy dies at 61,"    Matteo Messina Denaro was apprehended earlier this year in a private clinic in Palermo (Italy), after three decades in hiding. He died in his hospital bed in the city of L'Aquila during the night of September 24, 2023. ","Sicilian Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro, aged 61 years old, had colon cancer, for which he had sought treatment while on the run – a decision that brought him to the attention of the authorities, who arrested him at a clinic in Palermo. He was detained in a high-security jail in L'Aquila, central Italy, where he continued treatment for his cancer in his cell, where he died.Messina Denaro was one of the most ruthless bosses in Cosa Nostra, the real-life Sicilian crime syndicate depicted in the Godfather movies. He was convicted by the courts of involvement in the murder of anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone in 1992 and in deadly bombings in Rome, Florence, and Milan in 1993. One of his six life sentences was also handed down for the kidnapping and subsequent murder of the 12-year-old son of a witness in the Falcone case.Messina Denaro disappeared in the summer of 1993 and spent the next 30 years on the run as the Italian state cracked down on the Sicilian mob. But he remained the top name on Italy's most-wanted list and, increasingly became a figure of legend.In a stunning swoop, he was arrested on January 16, 2023, as he visited a health clinic where he was being treated using a fake identity. In August, Messina Denaro was moved to the inmates' ward of the San Salvatore hospital in the central Italian town of L'Aquila, where his condition had declined in recent days. This weekend, media reports said he was in an ""irreversible coma"". Medics had stopped feeding him and he had asked not to be resuscitated, they added.After Messina Denaro went on the run, there was intense speculation that he had gone abroad – and he likely did. But in the end, he was found to have been staying near his hometown of Castelvetrano in western Sicily. Investigators had been combing the Sicilian countryside for Messina Denaro for years, searching for hideouts and wiretapping members of his family and his friends. They were heard discussing the medical problems of an unnamed person who suffered from cancer, as well as eye problems – a person who detectives became sure was Messina Denaro. They used a national health system database to search for male patients of the right age and medical history and eventually closed in.But while his arrest brought some relief for his victims, the mob boss always maintained his silence. In interviews in custody since being arrested, Messina Denaro even denied he was a member of the Cosa Nostra.",/en/obituaries/
"Actor Michael Gambon, famous for playing Dumbledore in 'Harry Potter,' dies aged 82","    Sir Gambon won four BAFTAs over a career spanning television, film, radio and theater. ","Veteran actor Michael Gambon, who was known to many for his portrayal of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore in six of the eight Harry Potter films, has died, his publicist said on Thursday, September 28. He was 82.A statement by his family, issued by his publicist, said he died following ""a bout of pneumonia."" ""We are devastated to announce the loss of Sir Michael Gambon. Beloved husband and father, Michael died peacefully in hospital with his wife Anne and son Fergus at his bedside,"" his family said.No matter what role he took on in a career that lasted more than five decades, Gambon was always instantly recognizable by the deep and drawling tones of his voice. He was cast as the much-loved Dumbledore after the death of his predecessor, Richard Harris, in 2002.He once acknowledged not having read any of J. K. Rowling's best-selling books, arguing that it was safer to follow the script rather than be too influenced by the books. That didn't prevent him from embodying the spirit of Professor Dumbledore, the powerful wizard who fought against evil to protect his students.Although the Potter role raised Gambon's international profile and introduced him to a new generation of fans, he had long been recognized as one of Britain's leading actors. His work spanned TV, theater and radio, and he starred in dozens of films from Gosford Park to The King's Speech and the animated family movie Paddington. Gambon was knighted for services to drama in 1998.Born in Dublin, Ireland, on October 19, 1940, Gambon was raised in London and originally trained as an engineer, following in the footsteps of his father. He made his theater debut in a production of Othello in Dublin.In 1963 he got his first big break with a minor role in Hamlet, the National Theatre Company's opening production, under the directorship of the legendary Laurence Olivier.Gambon soon became a distinguished stage actor and received critical acclaim for his leading performance in Life of Galileo directed by John Dexter. He was frequently nominated for awards and won the Laurence Olivier Award 3 times and the Critics' Circle Theatre Awards twice.A multi-talented actor, Gambon was also the recipient of four coveted British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards for his television work.He became a household name in Britain after his lead role in the 1986 BBC series The Singing Detective, written by Dennis Potter and considered a classic of British television drama. Gambon won the BAFTA for best actor for the role.Gambon was versatile as an actor but once told the BBC of his preference for playing ""villainous characters."" He played gangster Eddie Temple in the British crime thriller Layer Cake – a review of the film by the New York Times referred to Gambon as ""reliably excellent"" – and a Satanic crime boss in Peter Greenaway's The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover.He also had a part as King George V in the 2010 drama film The King's Speech. In 2015 he returned to the works of J.K. Rowling, taking a leading role in the TV adaptation of her book The Casual Vacancy.Gambon retired from the stage in 2015 after struggling to remember his lines in front of an audience due to his advancing age. He once told the Sunday Times Magazine: ""It's a horrible thing to admit, but I can't do it. It breaks my heart.""The actor was always protective when it came to his private life. He married Anne Miller and they had one son, Fergus. He later had two sons with set designer Philippa Hart.",/en/obituaries/
"Michael Gambon, Irish-English actor who ruled the stage and halls of Hogwarts, has died","    Although best known internationally for his role as Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series, Gambon was also a stalwart of the theater. He died of pneumonia on September 27 at the age of 82. ","Were it not for the untimely death of Richard Harris in 2002, a week before the release of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, leaving vacant the principal's position at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, this obituary probably would not exist. Michael Gambon, who replaced Harris as Albus Dumbledore from Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) to Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2, owes most of his fame outside the UK to his involvement in the Harry Potter saga.Yet this kindly but shrewd wizard character is not enough to sum up the career of an actor who was not only one of the pillars of British stage, from the 1980s to the turn of the century, but also the star of a seminal series in the history of television – The Singing Detective – and a supporting actor who often overshadowed his leading men on the silver screen. Gambon died of pneumonia in London on Wednesday, September 27, his family announced. He was 82 years old.Gambon was born in Dublin on October 19, 1940. In 1946, he and his mother joined his father, who had crossed the Irish Sea to participate in the rebuilding of London, earning him dual British and Irish citizenship. As a teenager, he took courses in mechanics, which led to a job with the Vickers-Armstrong aircraft manufacturer.It was while helping to build sets for an amateur theatre company that he was bitten by the acting bug. Posing as a London actor, he managed to get hired by an Irish company, then joined Sir Laurence Olivier's National Theatre Company. There, he played supporting parts until Olivier advised him to move away from London, to try his hand at more serious roles. In Birmingham, he played Othello, Macbeth and Coriolan.In 1970, he returned to London and dazzled critics and audiences alike in the lead role in The Life of Galileo, by Bertolt Brecht, directed by John Dexter. He then went on to become one of the stars of the contemporary British stage, playing Harold Pinter (taking part in the creation of Betrayal ), David Hare and Alan Ayckbourn. Ayckbourn directed him in Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge, in 1987, in the role of docker Eddie Carbone. This performance further cemented the actor's reputation.His physique, which he likened to a ""crumpled plastic bag,"" made him unsuitable for certain roles, starting with Hamlet. This did not prevent him from exuding a sort of authority and charm that were at times irresistible, as the students at Hogwarts came to realize.Around the same time, he started working in film and television. In 1986, writer Dennis Potter entrusted Gambon with the dual role of The Singing Detective, a detective, poetic and musical series, where he plays both a writer confined to his hospital bed by a disfiguring illness and the hero of the noir novels born of his imagination. The series helped establish the artistic legitimacy of the serial format. On the silver screen, Gambon played the thief in The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, (1989) by Peter Greenaway, alongside Richard Bohringer and Helen Mirren.",/en/obituaries/
US Senate veteran Dianne Feinstein dies at 90,"    Although Feinstein was not always embraced by the feminist movement, her experiences colored her outlook throughout her five decades in politics. ","Veteran Senator Dianne Feinstein, a titan of US political history who notched countless legislative achievements during a trailblazing three-decade career in the Senate, has died at 90 years old, US media reported Friday.Feinstein, the oldest senator, was celebrated as a hugely effective legislator and tough check on administrations from both parties – but had announced her retirement as her health worsened and following a number of missteps that threatened her legacy.A centrist Democrat who was elected to the Senate in 1992 in the ""Year of the Woman,"" Feinstein broke gender barriers throughout her long career in local and national politics. She was a passionate advocate for liberal priorities important to her state –including environmental protection, reproductive rights and gun control – but was also known as a pragmatic lawmaker who reached out to Republicans and sought middle ground.She was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969 and became its first female president in 1978, the same year Mayor George Moscone was gunned down alongside Supervisor Harvey Milk at City Hall by Dan White, a disgruntled former supervisor. Feinstein found Milk's body.After Moscone's death, Feinstein became San Francisco's first female mayor. In the Senate, she was one of California's first two female senators, the first woman to head the Senate Intelligence Committee and the first woman to serve as the Judiciary committee's top Democrat.Although Feinstein was not always embraced by the feminist movement, her experiences colored her outlook through her five decades in politics.",/en/obituaries/
"Louise Glück, US poet and Nobel laureate, dies at 80","    Glück, a poet of unblinking candor and perception who wove classical allusions, philosophical reveries, bittersweet memories and humorous asides into indelible portraits of a fallen and heartrending world, passed away on Friday. ","American poet Louise Glück, winner of the Nobel and Pulitzer prizes for her distinctively austere writing, has died, a Yale University spokeswoman told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Friday, October 13. The New York native, 80, most recently taught at Yale as a poetry professor. She died of cancer, The New York Times reported, citing friend and former Yale colleague Richard Deming, on Friday at her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Glück was the 2020 Nobel laureate in literature, the 16th woman to win the award. Her idols included other winners of the same prize, such as William Butler Yeats (1923) and T.S. Eliot (1948). Like theirs, the austerity of her poetry was a source of strength: ""The unsaid, for me, exerts great power,"" she wrote in a collection of essays on poetry, ""Proofs and Theories.""Glück's work was informed by subjects such as nature's simple beauty and a child's experience of the world, coupled with the bold storylines of mythology. Her 2020 Nobel Prize honored her for ""her unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal."" The winner of a Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for her collection ""The Wild Iris,"" Glück became a professor despite never finishing college herself.She grew up in Long Island, New York, the descendant on her father's side of Hungarian Jews who emigrated in the early 20th century. She was also the winner of a National Book Award and served as the US Poet Laureate from 2003 to 2004.",/en/obituaries/
"Hubert Reeves, Canadian-French astrophysicist and science popularizer, dies aged 91","    A specialist in the history of the cosmos, Reeves made science accessible to all. He died in Paris on October 13, aged 91. ","With his patriarchal silhouette – balding head, white beard, sparkling blue eyes – his singing Quebec accent and his precise, colorful words, Hubert Reeves was both the grandfather who could tell us wonderful stories and the wizard who mixed the ingredients of the Universe in his cauldron. A pint of Milky Way, an extract of Moon, a few mysterious grains of dark matter... He explained to us that we were all made of stardust, as most of the elements that make us up, such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, come directly from stellar forges. At the end of his time on Earth, on October 13, the astrophysicist returned to this cosmic dust. He was 91 years old.It was easy to forget he had ever been a child. Yet Reeves, born in Montréal on July 13, 1932, would often travel back in time to his youth. He would evoke the large wooden family home overlooking Lake Saint-Louis, which his grandfather had built at the beginning of the 20th century and where he had so many memories: canoe trips, his mother's call at nightfall (""Have you seen the sky?"") and, last but not least, his maternal grandmother, Charlotte Tourangeau, to whom Hubert owed his storytelling talents, and who must be mentioned here. Charlotte Tourangeau had no equal when it came to embellishing Charles Perrault's stories, extending and even mixing them to suit her imagination.""What you value by saying 'that's interesting', your children find valuable,"" he once told Le Monde during a meeting in 2002. ""My parents loved anything to do with the natural sciences, so the idea that I would work in science came to me very early on."" Fond of mathematics, the young Reeves opted for theoretical physics, which he studied first in Montreal and then in the United States at Cornell University in New York State, where, he recalled, ""the founders of nuclear astrophysics were to be found. There was the magic of the great American universities, where you feel capable of doing great things. There was an infectious creativity that gave you wings."" At Cornell, he completed his thesis under the supervision of Edwin Salpeter (1924-2008), who became famous for showing how stars, by fusing three helium atoms, give rise to a carbon atom.Reeves dived into the Universe's past, understanding that to be an astrophysicist was to become the historian of the cosmos and of matter. He was particularly interested in three light elements – lithium, beryllium and boron – too big to have been made at the time of the big bang, but too fragile to have been conceived in the thermonuclear fire of the stars. With Jean Audouze, the Canadian researcher showed that these elements are created when high-energy cosmic rays break up carbon, oxygen or nitrogen nuclei in space. In 2018, astrophysicist Michel Cassé, one of Hubert Reeves' PhD students, said: ""It's a paper that marked the times. Hubert had a very penetrating way of thinking about things in the sky. He wasn't sophisticated, he wasn't a dandy: he really went straight to the point without getting bogged down in frills.""In the early 1960s, Reeves taught in Montreal and became a scientific advisor to NASA. There, he trained professors for the space science departments that were springing up all over the place in US universities as the conquest of space took off. But, uncomfortable with the nationalist atmosphere in Quebec and eager to explore other horizons, he had his heart set on Europe. In 1964, he took a sabbatical and taught nuclear physics at the Université libre de Bruxelles. He was then invited to share his knowledge in France. It was a turning point in his life. He never looked back.Director of research at the CNRS, France's national scientific research center, and scientific advisor to the French Atomic Energy Commission, Reeves has followed a well-established career path. His second life, that of a media darling and storyteller of the stars, fell into his lap somewhat by chance. Encouraged by friends, he wrote a first manuscript entitled Patience dans l'azur (""Patience in the Blue""), in reference to a poem by Paul Valéry. He presented it to some thirty publishers, all of whom refused to publish it, foolishly believing that astronomy was of no interest to anyone, despite the universal questions about the origins of the world to which it provides answers.Reeves was about to put his manuscript away in a drawer and remain the almost anonymous researcher that he was, until the physicist Jean-Marc Lévy-Leblond, who heads the ""Science ouverte"" collection at Editions du Seuil, suggests that he...write a book. It was already ready: Patience dans l'azur was published in 1981, and the French discovered Reeves who recounted the cosmos like one reads a novel.""I was told I'd be lucky if it sold three thousand copies. Today, we've sold over a million copies and it's been translated into over thirty languages,"" Reeves told Le Monde in 2002. In the early 1980s, fame swooped down on him like a bird of prey on a field mouse, but he knew he had to be wary of it and keep it at arm's length: ""Fame is destabilizing, intoxicating and a little dangerous: you run the risk of getting a big head. Fortunately, my wife and friends keep an eye on me."" The book-television-lecture cycle began. Some thirty books followed Patience dans l'azur, including Dernières nouvelles du cosmos (""Latest news from the Cosmos"", 1994), and his memoirs Je n'aurai pas le temps (""I Won't Have Time"", 2008).A request for a lecture would arrive in the mail everyday and he imposed strict discipline on himself after too much involvement in his work cost him a divorce followed by depression. He gave one lecture a week in France and one a month abroad. In all, he gave more than 2,500 lectures.Reeves also took on the role of environmentalist. In 2001, he succeeded Théodore Monod as the head of the Ligue ROC for the preservation of wildlife. A few years later, the organization was renamed Humanité et biodiversité (Humanity and Biodiversity), and he became its honorary chairman. His love of nature, inherited from his parents, never left him.With his second wife, the journalist Camille Scoffier, he bought ""a dilapidated old farmhouse,"" in northern France, as he recounted in his memoirs. There are century-old oaks there, but Reeves wanted to go further by creating what he called ""the millennium forest, trees that can live for over a thousand years: cedars of Lebanon, redwoods, lime trees, ginkgos.""Distressed by global warming, pollution and the loss of biodiversity that he himself observed in the garden of his country home, he puts his fame at the service of the climate struggle. He wrote articles and called on mayors, members of parliament and candidates in the 2012 presidential election. ""In Malicorne, I had long seen him take a deep interest in plants and birds, which meant a lot to him,"" Michel Cassé told Le Monde in 2018. He summed up his friend's career as follows: ""After skimming the skies, he became passionate about the Earth.""In Je n'aurai pas le temps, Reeves asserted that astronomy and ecology could be seen ""as two facets of the same theme: our existence. Astronomy, by telling us the story of the Universe, tells us where we came from, and how we came to be here today. Ecology, by making us aware of the threats to our future, aims to tell us how to stay there.""",/en/obituaries/
"Arras terror attack: The death of Dominique Bernard, a respected literature teacher who 'took his work to heart'",    The 57-year-old teacher was killed by Mohammed M. on Friday. Three other people were injured in the attack. ,"""Monsieur Bernard,"" as the students called him, was ""a very patient teacher, really respectful."" ""And he could be funny too,"" said Anna. This high school student had barricaded herself in her classroom on Friday, October 13 when her ""teacher shouted that we had to close all the doors,"" as the terrorist entered their Gambetta-Carnot high school in the northern town of Arras.In front of the school, parents recalled who Dominique Bernard was, the 57-year-old French teacher who was killed by the assailant. The father of three daughters, who came from a family of teachers and was married to an English teacher, ""took time out for parent-teacher meetings and was a great listener."" ""He died because he tried to protect our children,"" lamented the mother of a high school student.Bernard studied literature in Lille, Northern Franc, and had been teaching there since the 1980s. Bruno Lecat, who shared the university benches with him, remembers him as ""a rich human being, very generous and attentive to others. He was a truly beautiful person."" During his studies, he formed a theater company with Nathalie Raoul, who described him to Agence France-Presse as a ""respectful, a little secretive, very delicate"" man. ""His personality was essential to the functioning of the group, with a great deal of discretion and originality"". At the time, he was a ""very intelligent student, not at all into fads or trends, a very unique person.""Bernard was ""a lover of literature who knew how to pass on his passion,"" and ""a hard-working teacher who took his work very much to heart,"" said philosophy teacher Damien Dousseau. ""He was a very cultured person with many interests. Outside his work here, he regularly gave lectures on literature, as well as cinema and music,"" added a distraught colleague and friend. Fabien Dufay, a sports teacher at Gambetta high school, recalled a ""very friendly colleague, with whom we used to have a lot of fun in the staff room.""In 2002, Bernard was one of the founders of the Université Populaire d'Arras (now closed), an open university created in the spirit of the schools founded by French philosopher Michel Onfray. Paule Orsoni, a retired philosophy teacher who worked alongside him on this project, called him a ""brilliant man with a very keen eye, a great connoisseur of Julien Gracq and René Char."" Bernard was also an avid traveler, taking the opportunity to indulge in another of his passions: cultural heritage and monuments.The students emphasized his personal qualities: ""He was very fair, he respected us. He didn't play favorites and we were all the same to him,"" said 16-year-old Sacha Ahlers. Alysée Lecœur's sister, a student, had him as her main teacher in 2020. She remembers that ""Mr. Bernard succeeded in making (her sister) love French, while before, she rarely opened a book. He knew how to bring life to his lessons and talk about writers in a way that interested students."" ""He was fair and warm,"" she added, and ""didn't need to raise his voice to be respected."" Bernard and his family lived in Berneville, a small village of 500 inhabitants around ten kilometers from Arras.",/en/obituaries/
'Carrie' actress Piper Laurie dies at 91,"    The actress, three-time Academy Award nominee for 'The Hustler,' 'Carrie' and 'Children of a Lesser God,' died early Saturday in her home in Los Angeles. ","Piper Laurie, the strong-willed, Oscar-nominated actor who performed in acclaimed roles despite at one point abandoning acting altogether in search of a ""more meaningful"" life, died early Saturday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91. Laurie died of old age, her manager, Marion Rosenberg, told The Associated Press via email, adding that she was ""a superb talent and a wonderful human being.""Laurie arrived in Hollywood in 1949 as Rosetta Jacobs and was quickly given a contract with Universal-International, a new name that she hated and a string of starring roles with Ronald Reagan, Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis, among others. She went on to receive Academy Award nominations for three distinct films: the 1961 poolroom drama The Hustler; the film version of Stephen King's horror classic Carrie, in 1976; and the romantic drama Children of a Lesser God, in 1986. She also appeared in several acclaimed roles on television and the stage, including in David Lynch's Twin Peaks in the 1990s as the villainous Catherine Martell.Laurie made her debut at 17 in Louisa, playing Reagan's daughter, then appeared opposite Francis the talking mule in Francis Goes to the Races. She made several films with Curtis, whom she once dated, including The Prince Who Was a Thief, No Room for the Groom, Son of Ali Baba and Johnny Dark.Fed up, she walked out on her $2,000-a-week contract in 1955, vowing she wouldn't work again unless offered a decent part. She moved to New York, where she found the roles she was seeking in theater and live television drama.Performances in Days of Wine and Roses, The Deaf Heart and The Road That Led After brought her Emmy nominations and paved the way for a return to films, including in an acclaimed role as Paul Newman's troubled girlfriend in The Hustler.For many years after, Laurie turned her back on acting. She married film critic Joseph Morgenstern, welcomed a daughter, Ann Grace, and moved to a farmhouse in Woodstock, New York. She said later that the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War had influenced her decision to make the change.""I was disenchanted and looking for an existence more meaningful for me,"" she recalled, adding that she never regretted the move. ""My life was full,"" she said in 1990. ""I always liked using my hands, and I always painted."" Laurie also became noted as a baker, with her recipes appearing in The New York Times.Her only performance during that time came when she joined a dozen musicians and actors on a tour of college campuses to support Senator George McGovern's 1972 presidential bid.Laurie was finally ready to return to acting when director Brian De Palma called her about playing the deranged mother of Sissy Spacek in Carrie.At first, she felt the script was junk, and then she decided she should play the role for laughs. Not until De Palma chided her for putting a comedic turn on a scene did she realize he meant the film to be a thriller.Carrie became a box-office smash, launching a craze for movies about teenagers in jeopardy, and Spacek and Laurie were both nominated for Academy Awards.Her desire to act rekindled, Laurie resumed a busy career that spanned decades. On television, she appeared in such series as Matlock, Murder, She Wrote and Frasier and played George Clooney's mother on ER.",/en/obituaries/
"'Three's Company,' 'Step by Step' actress Suzanne Somers dies at 76",    Somers' career took off after playing the blonde driving the white Thunderbird in George Lucas's 1973 film 'American Graffiti.' She had breast cancer for over 23 years and died on Sunday. ,"Suzanne Somers, the effervescent blonde actor known for playing Chrissy Snow on the television show Three's Company as well as her business endeavors, has died. She was 76.Somers had breast cancer for over 23 years and died on Sunday morning, October 15, her family said in a statement provided by her longtime publicist R. Couri Hay. Her husband Alan Hamel, her son Bruce and other immediate family were with her.""Her family was gathered to celebrate her 77th birthday on October 16th,"" the statement read. ""Instead, they will celebrate her extraordinary life, and want to thank her millions of fans and followers who loved her dearly.""In July, Somers shared on Instagram that her breast cancer had returned. ""Like any cancer patient, when you get that dreaded, 'It's back' you get a pit in your stomach. Then I put on my battle gear and go to war,"" she told Entertainment Tonight at the time. ""This is familiar battleground for me and I'm very tough.""She was first diagnosed in 2000, 2000 2000, and also had skin cancer. She faced some backlash for her reliance on what she's described as a chemical-free and organic lifestyle to combat the cancers. She argued against the use of chemotherapy, in books and on platforms like ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" which drew criticism from the American Cancer Society.Somers was born in 1946 in San Bruno, California, to a gardener father and a medical secretary mother. She began acting in the late 1960s, playing the blonde driving the white Thunderbird in George Lucas's 1973 film American Graffiti. Her only line was mouthing the words ""I love you"" to Richard Dreyfuss's character.At her audition, Lucas just asked her if she could drive. She later said that moment ""changed her life forever."" Somers would later stage a one-woman Broadway show entitled The Blonde in the Thunderbird, which drew largely scathing reviews.Somers appeared in many television shows in the 1970s, including The Rockford Files, Starsky and Hutch and The Six Million Dollar Man, but her most famous part came with Three's Company, which aired on ABC from 1977 to 1984 – though her participation ended in 1981.On Three's Company, she was the ditzy blonde opposite John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt in the roommate comedy. In 1980, after four seasons, she asked for a raise from $30,000 an episode to $150,000 an episode, which would have been comparable to what Ritter was getting paid. Hamel, a former television producer, had encouraged the ask.""The show's response was, 'Who do you think you are?'"" Somers told People in 2020. ""They said, 'John Ritter is the star.'""She was soon fired and her character was replaced by two different roommates for the remaining years the show aired. It also led to a rift with her co-stars; They didn't speak for many years. Somers did reconcile with Ritter before his death, and then with DeWitt on her online talk show.But Somers took the break as an opportunity to pursue new avenues, including a Las Vegas act, writing books, hosting a talk show and becoming an entrepreneur.Somers returned to network television in the 1990s, most famously on Step by Step, which aired on ABC's youth-targeted TGIF lineup. The network also aired a biopic of her life, starring her, called Keeping Secrets.",/en/obituaries/
Former Finnish president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari dies aged 86,"    The global peace broker was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008 for his work to resolve violent conflicts in countries including Kosovo, Serbia and Northern Ireland. ","Martti Ahtisaari, the former president of Finland and global peace broker awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008 for his work to resolve international conflicts, died Monday. He was 86.The foundation he created for preventing and resolving violent conflicts said in a statement it was ""deeply saddened by the loss of its founder and chair of board.""""It is with great sadness that we have received the news of the death of President Martti Ahtisaari,"" Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö said in a statement. ""He was president in times of change, who piloted Finland into a global EU era."" In 2021, it was announced that Ahtisaari had advanced Alzheimer’s disease.Among his most notable achievements, Ahtisaari helped reach peace accords related to Serbia's withdrawal from Kosovo in the late 1990s, Namibia’s bid for independence in the 1980s, and autonomy for Aceh province in Indonesia in 2005. He was also involved with the Northern Ireland peace process in the late 1990s, being tasked with monitoring the terrorist group IRA's disarmament process.When the Norwegian Nobel Peace Committee picked Ahtisaari in October 2008, it cited him ""for his important efforts, on several continents and over more than three decades, to resolve international conflicts.""Ahtisaari who was the Nordic country's president for one six-year term – 1994 until 2000 – later founded the Helsinki-based Crisis Management Initiative, aimed at preventing and resolving violent conflicts through informal dialogue and mediation.Born June 23, 1937, in the eastern town of Viipuri, which is now in Russia, Ahtisaari was a primary school teacher before joining Finland’s Foreign Ministry in 1965. He spent some 20 years abroad, first as ambassador to Tanzania, Sambia and Somalia and then to the United Nations in New York.After that he joined the UN, working at its New York headquarters, before heading the UN operation that brought independence to Namibia in 1990. Ahtisaari had become deeply involved in activities aimed at preparing Namibians for independence during his diplomatic tenure in Africa in the 1970s.He was appointed as the special representative of Namibia by UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim in 1978, and is widely credited for leading the African nation to independence under his mandate as the head of UN peacekeeping forces there in the late 1980s. The Namibian government was grateful for Ahtisaari’s work and later made him an honorary citizen of the country.After returning to Finland in 1991, Ahtisaari worked as a foreign ministry secretary of state before being elected president in 1994 for a six-year term. He was the first Finnish head of state to be elected directly instead of through an electoral college.Having lived abroad for so long, he came into the race as a political outsider and was seen to bring a breath of fresh air to Finnish politics. Ahtisaari was a keen supporter of the European Union and NATO which Finland joined in 1995 and 2023 respectively.His international highlight came in 1999 when he negotiated – alongside Russia’s Balkans envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin – the end to fighting in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. Ahtisaari also hosted Russian President Boris Yeltsin and US President Bill Clinton at a US-Russia summit in Finnish capital, Helsinki, in March 1997.As president, Ahtisaari traveled abroad more widely than any of his predecessors. At home, he often appeared impatient and vexed by media criticism — he was clearly much more comfortable in international circles.He declined to run for a second term in the January 2000 presidential election, saying he wanted to devote the time he would otherwise have used for campaigning to run the rotating EU presidency, which Finland held for the first time in 1999.After the Finnish presidency, he was offered several international positions, including in the United Nations refugee agency, but decided instead to open his own office in Helsinki which has centered on mediating in international crises.In May 2017, Ahtisaari stepped down as chairman of the Crisis Management Initiative he founded in 2000 to help resolve global conflicts but said he would continue working with the organization as an adviser. He was replaced by former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb who is now running himself to become president.Ahtisaari is survived by his wife Eeva and their adult son. CMI said Ahtisaari will be laid to rest in a state funeral. The date will be announced later.",/en/obituaries/
The death of American Literature Nobel Prize-winning poet Louise Glück,"    The poet and essayist, considered a major voice in contemporary American poetry, was only recently translated into French. She died on October 13, aged 80. ","Having won a Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for The Wild Iris, she went on to win the prestigious National Book Award for Faithful and Virtuous Night 21 years later, before being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020: American poet Louise Glück died of cancer on Friday, October 13, in Cambridge (Massachusetts). She was 80 years old.Apart from a few sporadic translations in magazines, Louise Glück was virtually unknown in France before her crowning achievement in Stockholm. Nevertheless, she is a major voice in American poetry, celebrated throughout the English-speaking world. On Saturday, October 14, at the 40th Les Ecritures Croisées festival in Aix-en-Provence (southern France), South African writer J. M. Coetzee – the festival's guest of honor – told Le Monde of his long-standing interest in her work. ""I discovered Louise Glück through a photo. It was in a publication called The New American Poets from the 1960s. At the time, all the young American poets looked like hippies, but she, by contrast, seemed classic, reserved. For each author, there were a few lines. I read Glück's and have always followed her since. What struck me was the way in which her poetry went its own way, outside of trends. Unlike her contemporaries, who liked to flaunt their difficulties as poets, hers formed the foundations of her work, without ever being apparent in her art.""Stay the course, simply. This was the motto of this poet, born in New York on April 22, 1943, into a family of Hungarian origins. Little is known about her youth. Taken together, the few descriptions she did give us an idea of her personality, as well as her precocious passion for literature. At the age of five, this shy little girl was able to recite a poem by William Blake by heart. Then it was Shakespeare who enchanted her: she couldn't get enough of the song from Cymbeline. In her teens, she devoured Emily Dickinson (1830-1886), one of her great influences. At the age of 25, after studying at Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University in New York, she published the aptly named Firstborn, her first collection.Glück was undoubtedly influenced by Dickinson. But she insisted she belonged to no group. She didn't identify with any particular tradition. ""I admire Stevens and Dickinson,"" she explained to Po&sie magazine in 1985. ""But I feel other proximities, other debts: Eliot, Williams, Pounds, Oppen, Cavafy, etc."" She also cited Rilke and Sylvia Plath. In English, her output is substantial: a dozen collections and two essays on poetic creation, including Proofs and Theories (Ecco, 1994). In it, Glück underlines her fondness for moving forms and praises the ""malleable,"" the ""unfinished."" A further difficulty for those wishing to assign her a precise poetic genre.",/en/obituaries/
"Former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, tireless mediator for peace, has died","    The dedicated elder statesman and diplomat, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008, died on Monday, October 16, in Helsinki. He was 86 years old. ","""Peace is a question of will. All conflicts can be settled, and there are no excuses for allowing them to become eternal,"" said former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari on December 10, 2008, in Oslo, where he had just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless role as a mediator in international conflicts. After suffering from Alzheimer's disease, the diplomat passed away on Monday, October 16, at the age of 86.""Finland has lost a remarkable statesman. Europe, a visionary. And the world, a champion of peace,"" was the reaction from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on the social network X (formerly Twitter), while NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg lauded him as the ""world champion of peace, security and conflict prevention.""In Finland, the news prompted considerable emotion. In a live televised address, President Sauli Niinistö hailed him as ""a great Finn."" Even before his death, he had already been elevated to the ranks of the country's ""great historical figures,"" noted former prime minister Alexander Stubb, who chairs the board of the Crisis Management Initiative, created by Ahtisaari in 2005. Every year on November 10, ""Ahtisaari Day"" is celebrated, promoting peace education and conflict prevention in schools.The displacement of his family ""influenced his vision of the world and his actions. Not by tainting them with bitterness, but by enabling him to understand people's destinies and to know the value of peace,"" noted Niinistö. The son of a non-commissioned officer, Ahtisaari was born in 1937 in Karelia, a province annexed by the USSR during the Second World War. ""I was only two years old when (...) war broke out, forcing my family to leave soon thereafter the town of Viipuri. Like several hundred thousand fellow Karelians, we became refugees in our own country as great power politics caused the borders of Finland to be redrawn and left my hometown as part of the Soviet Union,"" he recounted at the Nobel ceremony.Ahtisaari grew up in Kuopio, central Finland. At 19, he joined the Social Democratic Party, then studied to become a primary school teacher. He only taught for one year. Recruited by a Swedish NGO, he was appointed director of a boarding school in Karachi, Pakistan, where he stayed for three years. Upon his return, he joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the Cooperation Department.His diplomatic career began in 1973. At the age of 36, he was appointed Finland's ambassador to Tanzania. There he discovered the situation in Namibia, which was fighting for independence from South Africa. He took part in the decolonization process, which he would later describe as a ""marathon,"" first as UN envoy for Namibia, then as special representative of the UN Secretary-General, until the country finally gained independence in 1990.",/en/obituaries/

Oscar-nominated actor Burt Young dies at 83,"    The actor, best known for playing Paulie in the 'Rocky' franchise – for which he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor – died on October 8 in Los Angeles. ","Burt Young, the Oscar-nominated actor who played Paulie, the rough-hewn, mumbling-and-grumbling best friend, corner man and brother-in-law to Sylvester Stallone in the Rocky franchise, has died.Young died on October 8 in Los Angeles, his daughter, Anne Morea Steingieser, told the New York Times on Wednesday, October 18. No cause was given. He was 83.Young had roles in acclaimed films and television shows including Chinatown, Once Upon a Time in America and The Sopranos. But he was always best known for playing Paulie Pennino in six Rocky movies. The short, paunchy, balding Young was the sort of actor who always seemed to play middle-aged no matter his age.When Paulie first appears in 1976's Rocky, he's an angry, foul-mouthed meat packer who is abusive to his sister Adrian (Talia Shire), with whom he shares a small apartment in Philadelphia. He berates the shy, meek Adrian for refusing at first to go on a Thanksgiving-night date with his buddy and co-worker Rocky Balboa, and destroys a turkey she has in the oven.The film became a phenomenon, topping the box office for the year and making a star of lead actor and writer Stallone, who paid tribute to Young on Instagram on Wednesday night. Along with a photo of the two of them on the set of the first film, Stallone wrote ""you were an incredible man's and artist, I and the World will miss you very much.""Rocky was nominated for 10 Oscars, including best supporting actor for Young. It won three, including best picture. Young and co-star Burgess Meredith, who was also nominated, lost to Jason Robards in All the President's Men.As the movies went on, Young's Paulie softened, as the sequels themselves did, and he became their comic relief. In 1985's ""Rocky IV"" he reprograms a robot Rocky gives him into a sexy-voiced servant who dotes on him. Paulie was also an eternal pessimist who was constantly convinced that Rocky was going to get clobbered by his increasingly daunting opponents. His surprise at Rocky’s resilience brought big laughs. ""It was a great ride, and it brought me to the audience in a great way,"" Young said in a 2020 interview with Celebrity Parents magazine. ""I made him a rough guy with a sensitivity. He’s really a marshmallow even though he yells a lot.""Born and raised in Queens, New York, Young served in the Marine Corps, fought as a professional boxer and worked as a carpet layer before taking up acting, studying with legendary teacher Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. On stage, in films and on television, he typically played small-time tough guys or down-on-their-luck working-class men.In a short but memorable scene in 1974's Chinatown, he plays a fisherman who throws a fit when Jack Nicholson's private detective Jake Gittes shows him pictures proving his wife is cheating on him. Young also appeared in director Sergio Leone's 1984 gangster epic Once Upon a Time in America with Robert De Niro, the 1986 comedy Back to School with Rodney Dangerfield, and the 1989 gritty drama Last Exit to Brooklyn with Jennifer Jason Leigh.In a striking appearance in season three of The Sopranos in 2001, he plays Bobby Baccalieri, Sr., an elderly mafioso with lung cancer who pulls off one last hit before a coughing fit leads to him dying in a car accident. He guest-starred on many other TV series including M*A*S*H, Miami Vice and The Equalizer. Later in life, he focused on roles in the theater and on painting, a lifelong pursuit that led to gallery shows and sales.His wife of 13 years, Gloria, died in 1974. Along with his daughter, Young is survived by one grandchild and a brother, Robert.",/en/obituaries/
Former Chinese premier Li Keqiang dies of heart attack at 68,"    Li, a reform-minded bureaucrat, was considered a contender to succeed then-Communist Party leader Hu Jintao in 2013 but was passed over in favor of Xi Jinping, under whom he served as premier for 10 years. ","Former Chinese premier Li Keqiang has died after suffering a heart attack at the age of 68, state media reported Friday, October 27. A reform-minded bureaucrat, Li was once tipped as the country's future leader only to be eclipsed by President Xi Jinping, under whom he served as premier for 10 years. Xinhua news agency said Li had a sudden heart attack on Thursday and passed away in the early hours of Friday in Shanghai, where he had been resting.During his time as premier, Li cultivated an image as a more modern apparatchik compared to his stiffer colleagues. A career bureaucrat who spoke fluent English, he had voiced support for economic reforms during his time in office. He showed liberal tendencies in his youth but toed the party line for decades, and his reputation was damaged by his handling of an HIV/AIDS epidemic stemming from a tainted blood donation program while he was party boss in Henan province. Local authorities responded with a clampdown on activists and the media rather than assigning responsibility to the officials involved, and at the national level a stream of health scandals also happened on his watch.Li, the son of a minor party official in eastern China's poor Anhui province, was sent to the countryside to work as a manual laborer during China's tumultuous Cultural Revolution. He went on to gain a law degree from Peking University, where classmates say he embraced Western and liberal political theory, translating a book on the law by a British judge. But he became more orthodox after joining the ranks of officialdom in the mid-80s, working as a bureaucrat while his former classmates protested in Tiananmen Square in 1989.Li rose to become the party's top official in Henan, and in Liaoning province in the northeast – both of which saw economic growth – before being promoted to become a deputy to then-premier Wen Jiabao. But his attempts at tackling China's deep economic challenges were curtailed by the overwhelming authority of Xi Jinping, with whom he was once seen as a rival for the country's leadership.Li was praised for helping to steer the country through the global financial crisis relatively unscathed. But his time in office saw a dramatic shift in power in China from the more consensus-based rule associated with former leader Hu Jintao and his predecessors to the more concentrated power of Xi. It also saw China's economy begin to slow from the dizzying heights experienced in the 1990s and 2000s.When Li left office, the Chinese economy was experiencing some of its lowest growth in decades, battered by a Covid-induced slowdown and a crisis in the housing market. The appointment of Xi ally Li Qiang – a former Shanghai party boss – as his successor this year was seen as a sign that his reformist agenda had fallen by the wayside as Beijing tightens its grip over its slowing economy.But in his final speech as outgoing premier, Li struck a bullish tone, saying China's economy was ""staging a steady recovery and demonstrating vast potential and momentum for further growth"". ""Overcoming great difficulties and challenges, we succeeded in maintaining overall stable economic performance."" ""There was always a feeling that Li was the last bastion of reason and heart in an otherwise ideological age,"" historian Jeremiah Jenne said in a post on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.",/en/obituaries/
"Matthew Perry, elegy for a sad clown","The actor, who died on October 28, was the most constructed and endearing character in the cult series 'Friends'.","With the exception of James Michael Tyler (Gunther, the Central Perk barista), who died prematurely of cancer in 2021, Matthew Perry is the first ""friend"" to go, also ahead of his time. Above all, he is the first of the core gang of six, and the emotion that tinges the tributes paid in the media and on the networks speaks volumes about the sympathy that the character Chandler Bing and the actor who personified him continued to elicit. Perry's death on Saturday, October 28, in a way brings the series to a close, almost 20 years after its last episode. Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Joey and Chandler will never be seen together again.The circumstances of his death, while still obscure, hint at a body giving out after much struggle. Audiences realised the extent of the actor's physical deterioration during his participation in the Friends: The Reunion program organized in 2021, although, at the time of recording, Perry had been sober for 18 months. Everyone knew he wasn't well, his state of health filled the pages of celebrity magazines, but to this extent? Opiates, heroin, alcohol. Leafing through the memoirs he wrote – alone, which is rare in the entertainment business – and published in 2022, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, you could be forgiven for wondering above all how he managed to live to 54 on such a regime.Of the six Friends,  Perry's performance was undoubtedly the most immersive. And to say that he never inhabited a role as fully as Chandler Bing's is no slight to him. Especially since this character of a sarcastic financier, clumsy in love, precursor of the cringe and full of strange behaviors (who could possibly forget his habit of dancing every time something important happens to him?), had everything to be less lovable than Joey (Matt LeBlanc), the idiot heartthrob, or Ross (David Schwimmer), the uptight paleontologist. On the contrary, along with Monica (Courteney Cox), he was perhaps the most constructed and endearing character in the sitcom created by Marta Kauffman and David Crane. These two oddballs didn't end up together for nothing.For those who may have forgotten the actor's burlesque talent and the precision of his acting, just go and search YouTube for the countless best of Chandler scenes. Between the ""shut up!!!"" from the couch scene (season 5, episode 16, the best of the entire series), the mustache attempt during season 2 and the desk drawer he voluntarily gets handcuffed to by Rachel's boss (season 4), there are plenty of good examples to choose from.",/en/obituaries/
'Friends' actor Matthew Perry dies aged 54,"    The actor was found dead of an apparent drowning at his Los Angeles home Saturday, according to the Los Angeles Times and celebrity website TMZ. ","Friends star Matthew Perry, the Emmy-nominated actor whose sarcastic, but lovable Chandler Bing was among television’s most famous and most quotable characters, has died at 54.The actor was found dead of an apparent drowning at his Los Angeles home on Saturday, October 28, according to the Los Angeles Times and celebrity website TMZ , which was the first to report the news. Both outlets cited unnamed sources confirming Perry's death.""Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of the Warner Bros. Television Group family,"" the company said in a statement. ""The impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many. This is a heartbreaking day, and we send our love to his family, his loved ones, and all of his devoted fans.""Asked to confirm police response to what was listed as Perry’s home address, LAPD Officer Drake Madison told the AP that officers had gone to that block ""for a death investigation of a male in his 50s.""Perry's 10 seasons on Friends made him one of Hollywood's most recognizable actors, starring opposite Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer as a friend group in New York. As Chandler, he played the quick-witted, insecure and neurotic roommate of LeBlanc's Joey and a close friend of Schwimmer's Ross.Perry had battled for years with addiction to painkillers and alcohol, and attended rehabilitation clinics on multiple occasions. He was open about it, writing at the beginning of his 2022 million-selling memoir: ""Hi, my name is Matthew, although you may know me by another name. My friends call me Matty. And I should be dead.""Friends ran from 1994 until 2004, winning one best comedy series Emmy Award in 2002. The cast notably banded together for later seasons to obtain a salary of $1 million per episode for each. The series was one of television’s biggest hits and has taken on a new life – and found surprising popularity with younger fans – in recent years on streaming services.Perry described reading the Friends script for the first time in his memoir, Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing. ""It was as if someone had followed me around for a year, stealing my jokes, copying my mannerisms, photocopying my world-weary yet witty view of life. One character in particular stood out to me: it wasn’t that I was thought I could ‘play’ Chandler. I ‘was’ Chandler.""Unknown at the time was the struggle Perry had with addiction and an intense desire to please audiences. ""Friends was huge. I couldn’t jeopardize that. I loved the script. I loved my co-actors. I loved the scripts. I loved everything about the show but I was struggling with my addictions which only added to my sense of shame,"" he wrote in his memoir.""I had a secret and no one could know."" ""I felt like I was gonna die if the live audience didn’t laugh, and that’s not healthy for sure. But I could sometimes say a line and the audience wouldn’t laugh and I would sweat and sometimes go into convulsions,"" Perry wrote. ""If I didn’t get the laugh I was supposed to get I would freak out. I felt that every single night. This pressure left me in a bad place. I also knew of the six people making that show, only one of them was sick.""Perry received one Emmy nomination for his Friends role and two more for appearances as an associate White House counsel on The West Wing. Perry also had several notable film roles, starring opposite Salma Hayek in the rom-com Fools Rush In and Bruce Willis in the the crime comedy The Whole Nine Yards. He worked consistently after Friends, though never in a role that brought him as much attention or acclaim.",/en/obituaries/
Macron hosts religious leaders to discuss fight against anti-Semitism,"    The French president met with leaders from several faiths one day after a large march 'for the republic and against anti-Semitism,' which he did not attend. ","President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, November 13, hosted religious leaders for talks on combatting anti-Semitism in France, a day after a Paris march rallied tens of thousands to express anxiety over an upsurge in acts against Jews. There have been growing tensions in France, home to large Muslim and Jewish communities, as war rages in the Gaza Strip between the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel.Monday's talks were a ""continuation of the appeal for national unity and brotherhood"" Macron had made in a letter published on Saturday in the newspaper Le Parisien, Macron wrote that ""a France where our Jewish fellow citizens are afraid is not France,"" calling on people to rally around the country's ""values"" and ""universalism.""The country has seen an upsurge in anti-Semitic acts since Hamas's bloody October 7 attack on Israel killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and Israel's response in the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has claimed more than 11,000 lives, mostly civilians and many of them children.While the presidency did not specify who had been invited to Monday's meeting, France's chief rabbi Haïm Korsia, Catholic bishops' conference head Eric de Moulins-Beaufort and rector of the Paris Grand Mosque Chems-Eddine Hafiz were all present. Leaders from other faiths including the Orthodox church, Buddhism and Protestantism were also in attendance.Macron had urged the religious leaders to make an ""educational effort to increase the number of measures addressed to young people,"" Catholic bishops' conference head Eric de Moulins-Beaufort told reporters after the meeting.""The president's aim, which of course we will help pass on, is to spread this message,"" said Elie Korchia, president of France's Central Israelite Consistory. ""Many young people no longer necessarily read the press, no longer watch TV, sometimes they're shut up in a language of their own, without reaching out to others,"" he added.Sunday's march ""should have been made into a battle against racism, that was important,"" Hafiz said, arguing that as well as ""a real increase in anti-Semitism,"" France has seen ""an outburst of remarks made against Muslims."" Nevertheless, ""I don't want to get into a victimhood contest,"" he added.Over 180,000 people turned out across France on Sunday according to police figures, 105,000 of them in Paris, to join marches ""for the republic and against anti-Semitism."" Macron himself has been criticized for staying away from the march.Jordan Bardella, head of the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) – which controversially joined the column – told broadcaster RTL on Monday that the president had ""missed a rendezvous with history.""Sylvain Maillard, leader of Macron's party's Assemblée Nationale group, defended the president, telling Sud Radio that ""a president's place isn't at a demonstration.""Macron ""will be judged on how effective state action against anti-Semitism is, rather than his presence at the head of a one-day demonstration,"" political commentator Guillaume Tabard wrote in the conservative daily Le Figaro.Macron has also been rebuked by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after criticizing Israel's extensive bombing campaign in Gaza in a weekend interview with the BBC. ""Civilians are bombed... these babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed... there is no reason for that and no legitimacy. So we do urge Israel to stop,"" he said.The French leader's office said late Sunday that he had spoken with Israeli President Isaac Herzog by phone in an apparent bid to calm the waters.Macron ""again expressed his solidarity with Israel in the face of the horror of the terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas"" and ""reiterated Israel's right to defend itself and repeated France's solidarity with Israel,"" the Elysee said.",/en/religions/
"With the death of Matthew Perry, 'Friends' loses its Chandler Bing","    Deliberately funny and ironic about his own weaknesses, weakened by his addictions to alcohol and painkillers, the actor marked the iconic sitcom with his impeccable sense of comic timing. He died on October 28 at the age of 54. ","Matthew Perry appeared in 14 feature films, 33 series and 14 TV movies between 1979 and 2017. But in the eyes of the world, the career of Perry, who was found dead in his jacuzzi in California's Beverly Hills on Sunday, October 28, at the age of 54, could be summed up in two words: Chandler Bing. Over the course of 236 episodes of Friends, hundreds of millions of viewers accompanied him as he transformed from a dynamic, sarcastic, insecure young executive into a good family man ready to leave Manhattan for the suburbs.But, at the same time as Friends was making it to be one of the biggest series in the world, Perry was sinking into addiction, first to alcohol, then to painkillers, involving multiple stays in rehabs. He retraced this path in his autobiography, Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing, published at the end of 2022. The actor had come close to death in 2018, suffering from pancreatitis whose side effects had plunged him into a coma.Perry was born on August 19, 1969 in Williamstown, Massachusetts. His father, John Bennett Perry, is an actor, while his mother, Suzanne Marie Morrison, is a Canadian journalist who worked with former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, father of Justin. Perry's parents separated shortly after his birth, and Perry grew up in Canada, where he developed a passion for tennis. At the age of 15, he joined his father in Los Angeles.As a high-school student, he embarked on an acting career, appearing in a number of series for one episode at a time. In 1988, after finishing high school, he landed his first recurring role, that of a high-school student in Boys Will Be Boys. The series was cancelled after one season. Until 1994, Perry appeared for a few episodes in a number of different successful series (Who's the Boss? Beverly Hills 90210). In the spring of 1993, his luck seemed to change when he landed the lead role, that of an irresponsible young man who still lives with his mother, in Home Free, a family sitcom programmed on Friday nights on ABC, one of the three major American networks. But the series was a flop with the public and went off the air after 13 episodes.In 1991, Perry starred in an episode of Dream On, a series created by David Crane and Martha Kauffman. Three years later, the duo sold their new project, Insomnia Cafe which followed the tribulations of six friends as they enter adulthood together in Manhattan, to the Warner Bros. television subsidiary. NBC then acquired Insomnia Cafe now Friends, which the network planned to air on prime time Thursday evenings. After auditioning, Perry landed the role of Chandler Bing, which he would play for almost 10 years, from September 22, 1994, when the first episode of Friends aired, to May 10, 2004, a dark day for millions of fans, deprived of their weekly dose of friendship and romance.",/en/obituaries/
Israel-Hamas war: French tourist bookings to Jordan and Egypt plummet,"    In October, French tourism professionals reported a drop in vacation reservations of up to 80% compared to 2022 over the same holiday period for the destinations closest to the Gaza Strip. ","Since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, Egypt's pyramids, Nile cruises and temples, as well as Jordan's desert, had been enjoying a resurgence in French tourism. In October, though, these two destinations closest to the Gaza Strip quickly came to a halt. ""It's very simple,"" summarized Raouf Ben Slimane, founder of Thalasso no. 1 and Ôvoyages. ""Over the past 10 days or so, as the crisis has intensified, we've seen cancellations and, above all, a real drop in bookings (in the order of 80% compared to 2022 over the same period) for these two countries close to the conflict zone,"" he pointed out, adding that of his 335,000 annual customers, 10,000 travel to these two countries. ""Tourists haven't been flocking to these destinations for over two weeks now,"" confirmed Stéphane Nicolas, Selectour's director of network development, who said he is hoping for ""deferrals"" to other destinations.""Obviously, we are not expecting Jordan to be a roaring success this year,"" admitted Guillaume Linton, CEO of the tour operator Asia Voyages, which has already seen a 60% drop in bookings for the country over the past three weeks, compared with those made in September.As far as cancellations of already-purchased trips, the trend is less pronounced. ""From All Saints' Day [November 1] to the end of December, it was 10%,"" said Linton, who is also counting on a fallback effect toward countries such as India, Thailand and Vietnam. ""We see all sorts of things,"" added Helmut Stuckelschweiger, head of Top of Travel, one of Jordan's leading travel agencies. ""On Tuesday, October 24, a couple was due to leave from Pau for Amman, but the husband refused to board, and his wife left without him.""""During the All Saints' Day vacations, people who had booked a trip to Egypt are going, including those with children,"" said Bruno Abenin, sales director at Travel Evasion. Over the whole of 2023, the number of Egyptian holidays sold by his company is still set to beat a record set over 15 years ago, with 30,000 customers visiting there. But the boom came to an abrupt halt since the murder of French teacher Dominique Bernard in Arras, and the climate of anxiety that followed the airport bomb scares. ""People are taking a wait-and-see attitude,"" he said, noting that since those events, ""sales have cooled"" and that bookings to Egypt for departures in April 2024 have dropped by around 40%.In Israel, which received over 3 million visitors in the first nine months of the year (including 800,000 Americans), there was, not surprisingly, a severe decline in the number of tourists from October 7 onward. Several tour operators and cruise lines have canceled all their trips or stopovers until at least early 2024. The streets of Jerusalem and Bethlehem, which have always been extremely popular with travelers, now stand empty.",/en/sports/
Messi wins eighth Ballon d'Or as Bonmati claims women's award,"    Lionel Messi received the Ballon d'Or from David Beckham, the co-owner of Inter Miami, on Monday. ","Lionel Messi won the eighth Ballon d'Or of his remarkable career at a glittering ceremony in Paris on Monday, October 31, while Spain's World Cup-winning star Aitana Bonmati took the women's prize.For Messi, the trophy rewards, above all else, his inspirational performances at last year's World Cup in Qatar, when he dragged Argentina to victory, scoring seven goals and being named the tournament's best player. It was the crowning moment of his astonishing career, and it allowed him to see off stiff competition, in particular from Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe, to take the award on the stage of the Chatelet Theatre in Paris. It was a return to the French capital after his departure from Paris Saint-Germain in June and his subsequent move to Inter Miami in Major League Soccer.""This is a gift to the whole Argentina team for what we achieved,"" said Messi on stage after receiving his award from David Beckham, the co-owner of Inter Miami. Messi dedicated the trophy to late Argentina legend Diego Maradona, who would have celebrated his 63rd birthday on Monday. ""Happy birthday Diego. This is for you too,"" he said.Messi benefits from a recent change which means the award is based on a player's record over the last season, rather than over the calendar year. He won despite an underwhelming final season at PSG, even if he was a Ligue 1 title winner.Messi is 36 and won his first Ballon d'Or in 2009. With eight, he is now three ahead of his old rival Cristiano Ronaldo, the next most decorated player in the history of the award. It remains to be seen if Messi will again feature in the running for the prize, which is voted for by one journalist in each of the top 100 nations in the FIFA ranking. ""I am not thinking about the long-term future. I am just enjoying the day-to-day at the moment,"" he said.Messi will struggle to hold off the next wave of superstars, led by Mbappe, Haaland and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham, but his World Cup performances made his victory this time feel inevitable.Mbappe was the star player in that team, scoring 41 goals, and was also the World Cup's top scorer with eight goals, including a hat-trick in the final which France lost to Argentina on penalties. Yet he fell just short of the Ballon d'Or, finishing third, while Norway striker Haaland came second after scoring 52 goals in 53 games for the Manchester City team that won the treble of English Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.The women's prize seemed even more clear cut, as Bonmati was rewarded for starring as Spain won the World Cup in Australia in August. The 25-year-old midfielder was named the best player at the World Cup as the Spanish team overcame off-field turbulence, including protests against their national federation and coach Jorge Vilda, to lift the trophy.Bonmati also starred as Barcelona won the Champions League last season and was recently named as the UEFA Women's Player of the Year. ""It is difficult to improve on this. It has been a unique year,"" she told various media. ""If anyone said to me when I was little that I would play at the Camp Nou, win the World Cup, two Champions Leagues, a Ballon d'Or, a UEFA award, these are extraordinary things.""She was one of four members of the triumphant Spain team to feature among the 30 nominees, with Alba Redondo, Salma Paralluelo and full-back Olga Carmona, who netted the winner in the final, all shortlisted.Last year's Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas, also part of that Spain side, was not nominated after missing almost all of last season with a knee injury. Australia's Sam Kerr came second with Paralluelo in third place. Putellas had won the Ballon d'Or in each of the previous two campaigns. Norway's Ada Hegerberg won the inaugural award in 2018 and USA star Megan Rapinoe succeeded her a year later.Bellingham won the Kopa Trophy for the best player of last season aged under 21. The 20-year-old has started his Madrid career with 13 goals in 13 games, although the prize rewards his performances in his final campaign with Borussia Dortmund. Bellingham's Madrid teammate, the Brazil forward Vinicius Junior, won the Socrates prize in recognition of his off-pitch work. Messi's Argentina colleague Emiliano Martinez won the Yashin Trophy for the best goalkeeper of the season.",/en/sports/
"World Cup 2034: After Australia's withdrawal, Saudi Arabia is sole bidder to host the competition","    On Tuesday, the Australian Football Association announced that it was abandoning its bid to host the 2034 World Cup. The Saudi kingdom has never been so close to becoming the tournament's host country. ","While football federations have until 11:59 pm on Tuesday, October 31, to submit their bids to the Fédération Internationale de Football (FIFA) to host the 2034 World Cup, one of them has just withdrawn. Early this morning, the Australian Football Association announced on X (formerly Twitter) that it was officially withdrawing its bid to host the event. ""We have explored the opportunity to bid to host the FIFA World Cup and – having taken all factors into consideration – we have reached the conclusion not to do so for the 2034 competition,"" the federation announced in its press release.At the beginning of October, Australia announced that it was working on a project to host the World Cup. A week later, it had even envisaged a joint ticket with Indonesia. Indonesian FA President Erick Thohir explained that Australia was in favor of a joint bid with his country, following discussions at the last FIFA Congress, held in Rwanda in March.Eventually, after the Indonesian federation changed its position and lent its support to the Saudi bid 10 days ago, Australia decided to throw in the towel. It justified this decision as a desire to concentrate on the organization of the 2026 Women's Asian Cup and the 2029 Club World Cup. The federation added that ""Achieving this – following the FIFA Women's World Cup Australia and New Zealand 2023 and with the Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games – would represent a truly golden decade for Australian football.""Thanks to this withdrawal, Saudi Arabia is now the short odds favorite to host the World Cup. Following the designation, on October 4, of Spain, Morocco and Portugal as hosts of the 2030 edition (with the organization of three matches in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay), FIFA launched a call for bids for the 2034 tournament. By virtue of the principle of continental rotation, the Asian and Oceanic federations were the ones in the running to host this edition.A few minutes after this call, Saudi Arabia, which had already positioned itself to organize the 2030 World Cup, confirmed that it would bid for the 2034 event. The Saudis immediately received the backing of the Asian Football Confederation, making them the clear favorite to organize the competition.Like Qatar in 2022, the country intends to use the World Cup as a powerful soft power tool. In a press release on October 4, the Saudi Arabian Football Federation announced that it ""intends to deliver a world-class tournament and will draw inspiration from Saudi Arabia's ongoing social and economic transformation and the country's deep-rooted passion for football."" Although the suspense is becoming increasingly thin, the host of the 2034 edition is expected to be officially unveiled by FIFA at the end of 2024.",/en/sports/
"Paris 2024 opening ceremony: Authorities consider admitting around 300,000 spectators for free","    A defense and security council meeting is scheduled for the end of November. The public authorities are finalizing the arrangements for screening, security controls and crowd control. ","The question of the number of spectators who will be able to access the upper quays of the Seine free of charge to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games on July 26, 2024, is expected to be decided at a defense and security council meeting scheduled for late November. The figure currently being discussed by the public authorities is around 300,000 people maximum, according to a source familiar with the discussions.Initially, the project was more ambitious: 100,000 paying spectators on the lower quays and 500,000 on the upper quays would attend the athletes' river parade, planned on barges over a 6-kilometer stretch between the François-Mitterrand Library and the Eiffel Tower.However, some stakeholders such as the Ile-de-France regional government as well as its public transportation authority, had warned of the difficulties and risks that such an influx could entail, particularly in terms of transportation.Back in May, Amélie Oudéa-Castéra, the French Minister for Sport and the Olympic and Paralympic Games, had already suggested a more limited option, with ""roughly 300,000 to 400,000 seats"" free of charge.International tensions (the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Gaza war), as well as the attack in the northern French city of Arras, where a teacher was killed, exacerbated security concerns for an already complex event.Officially, there are currently no plans to ""relocate"" the opening ceremony or to draw up a plan B: ""Plan A takes into account all of the threats,"" the government and the Paris 2024 Organizing Committee have pointed out in recent days.""Are we paying attention to the context? The answer is obviously yes,"" said Oudéa-Castréa on BFM-TV on October 26, explaining that the government is working on ""adjustment variables."" ""It would be irresponsible not to. But we want to keep the idea of this opening ceremony,"" she added.More than the exact number of spectators who will be able to access the upper quays, the issues that concern the authorities, and for which they must provide answers in the coming weeks, are how to manage crowd control and how to position filtering and control points in the right places.Concerning the first point, the protocol signed in May by the French government, the City of Paris and Paris 2024 stipulated that the free access spectators would be ""channeled and put into boxes demarcated with removable barriers,"" with an ""occupancy ratio of 3 people per m2"" – which corresponded roughly to 400,000 to 500,000 people.Despite this compartmentalization, it will be necessary to guard against the possible flow of spectators along the quays. Some might be tempted to move to follow the progress of the river parade. The risk would then be of a greater or lesser influx of people towards the Eiffel Tower and the Trocadéro Palace, where the parade ends, with the risk of the public being pushed and compressed.As far as filtering and control are concerned, the challenge for the authorities is not only to decide where these points are to be installed, but also to define how entrances and, above all, exits are to be managed and secured.For entrances, the online ticketing/reservation system to be set up by the Ministry of the Interior should allow spectators to be directed to the areas allocated to them.Reminders should be sent out beforehand. The first step will be to check that those who have booked tickets have confirmed their attendance – and, if so, that they have taken note of the area they will have to go to, and have been told which metro station to use, given the security perimeter that will be set up.But the other issue, which has been presented as potentially critical, because it is a possible source of tension, is that of exiting these free zones. The show promises to be long (over three hours), and it's not certain that everyone will make it to the end.Since all exits must be final, it will be necessary to plan how to manage possibly replacing those who have exited with others – a priori without tickets – who have waited for space to become available before being able to enter.",/en/sports/
World Cup 2034: FIFA's sleight of hand,"Saudi Arabia, the likely host of the football World Cup in 2034, is benefiting from the increasingly unclear designation process by the sport's governing body, which seems to disregard all environmental priorities and the interests of teams and spectators.","FIFA's announcement, on Tuesday, October 31, that Saudi Arabia was the sole bidder to host the World Cup in 2034, raises multiple questions about the process of designating the host country for one of the most watched sporting events on the planet.The official awarding of the competition is not expected until the end of 2024, but the outcome seems so obvious that it is more of a fait accompli than the open and transparent competition it is supposed to be. The Saudi kingdom became the lone candidate after Australia's withdrawal. With Indonesia backing Saudi Arabia rather than embarking on a joint bid with Australia, the latter apparently felt that the outcome was already clear.For several years now, FIFA has been issuing a series of decisions that have made the process of awarding World Cups increasingly unclear and predetermined. If Australia and Saudi Arabia seemed to be the only countries in the running, it was because, on October 4, FIFA chose to reserve the 2034 World Cup for Asia-Oceania (which includes the Middle East), having awarded the 2030 World Cup to a group of countries across three continents, breaking the tradition of geographical rotation. Spain, Portugal and Morocco will host the 2030 edition, but three matches will be played in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, with the pretext that this will allow Uruguay to celebrate the centenary of the World Cup, first played in that country in 1930. Thanks to this remarkable sleight of hand, the tournament will take place in Europe, Africa and South America, paving the way for Asia-Oceania in 2034.From then on, Saudi Arabia was in pole position. Its leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as ""MBS,"" wants to make the kingdom one of the great centers of international sporting competition of all kinds: golf, boxing, Formula 1 and, of course, football, a sport that is very popular in the country and the Arab world in general. The hosting of world sports championships and the recruitment by local clubs of international football stars such as Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema have become a major soft power asset for the kingdom and a tool for economic diversification, so much so that MBS has been dubbed the ""king of sportswashing.""The autocrat, who is constantly criticized by human rights NGOs, makes no secret of his ambitions: ""If sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by 1%, then we will continue doing sportswashing,"" he recently said to Fox News. ""I am aiming for another 1.5%. Call it whatever you want.""After the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA chief Gianni Infantino carefully cultivated his relationship with MBS. Beyond the legitimate criticism of the nature of the Saudi regime, however, this new controversy requires that Infantino and FIFA, a huge profit machine, provide a much better explanation as to the process behind decisions that promote the construction of air-conditioned stadiums, disrupt the calendars of national competitions, and force teams and fans to increasingly travel from one continent to another.",/en/sports/
"Paris 2024 Olympics: After the Games, more than 1,600 housing units will go to students","    During the competition, Olympic organizers are hoping to use student residences in the Paris region. ","In September 2024, the Paris Olympic Games will leave a material legacy: Minister of Higher Education Sylvie Retailleau announced in Le Parisien, on October 26 that, after the international competition, 1,667 housing units that will have hosted athletes and journalists during the Paris Olympic Games will be used for student housing. Eighty percent of these units are located in the department of Seine-Saint-Denis, just north of Paris. The remainder will be in Villeneuve-d'Ascq, in the Lille metropolitan area, in northern France.The management of this accommodation will be entrusted to private organizations, notably social housing associations, rather than the regional centers for university and school services (CROUS), the minister's entourage told Le Monde.Will this unexpected news be enough to restore a somewhat tarnished Olympic image among students? In the spring of 2023, the education authorities were asked by the Olympic Games Organizing Committee to free up 3,000 of the 22,000 university units in student residences in the Paris region during the event, pushing the usual tenants out. This initiative was suspended by the Paris Administrative Court, in a decision dated August 31, on the grounds that it was not permissible for CROUS ""to organize the vacancy of these accommodations"" in advance. Only rooms vacant on July 1, 2024, can be rented to the Committee, according to the provisions made in the law of March 26, 2018, relating to preparations for the event.The Paris CROUS has lodged an appeal with the Council of State, which is still pending, as Le Monde learned from the CROUS, which did not wish to give details of the arguments put forward. The Ministry, for its part, considers that the judge has ""not invalidated the principle on its merit, but on its form,"" and asserted that ""everything will be done according to the rules of law.""The minister confirmed that a maximum of 2,200 students will be relocated. Students will be relocated as close as possible to their place of study, and will receive a lump-sum payment of €100. Two tickets to Olympic events will also be offered to each of the students concerned.Two options were possible, as Minister Retailleau's entourage, who would like to ""put an end to the controversy,"" told Le Monde. The first was to distribute the public servants accredited for the Olympics among the 30% of vacant places in the residences during the summer period. ""But this choice meant having these people, who will be living with staggered schedules according to the rhythm of the competitions, cohabiting with students who are taking exams or working in the summer, which is not ideal,"" they said.",/en/sports/
Baseball: Texas Rangers win first-ever World Series title,    The Texas Rangers secured their first World Series championship in franchise history on Wednesday with a 5-0 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. ,"The Texas Rangers captured the World Series for the first time in the team's 63-year history on Wednesday, November 1, defeating Arizona 5-0 to complete a historic playoff championship run. Marcus Semien's two-run home run, a run-scoring Mitch Garver single and a pivotal ninth-inning Diamondbacks error produced the runs that enabled Texas to win Major League Baseball's best-of-seven final by 4-1. ""It's just emotional,"" Semien said. ""Everything I have ever worked for is for this moment.""Texas went undefeated in 11 contests on the road away from their suburban Dallas home ballpark, capped by sweeping three games in Phoenix over the Diamondbacks. ""It's such a treat,"" the Rangers' Nathaniel Lowe said. ""We really did a great job of finishing here on the road. Maybe we struggled at home but we've got a special group.""The Rangers, who began as the Washington Senators in 1961 before relocating to Texas in 1972, had reached the World Series in 2010 and 2011, losing first to San Francisco and then St. Louis.

I'm so proud of this team.""The D-backs suffered their first World Series defeat, having won the 2001 crown in their only prior appearance. Arizona pitcher Zac Gallen kept Texas hitless through six innings, the 28-year-old US right-hander baffling the same batters who blasted out 11 runs on 11 hits the night before. ""He had his good stuff working,"" Lowe said. ""But we finally got to him.""The Rangers pounced, however, in the top of the seventh with three consecutive hits as Corey Seager singled to left field, reached third base on Evan Carter's double and scored on Mitch Garver's single up the middle for a 1-0 lead. ""It was kind of a crazy game,"" Semien said. ""We got no-hit until the sixth or whatever inning it was. But we came through. Once Corey got the first hit everybody kind of woke up.""Texas shortstop Seager homered three times and drove in six runs in the World Series to win the Most Valuable Player award, becoming only the fourth player to take it twice after his MVP role for the 2020 champion Los Angeles Dodgers. ""Just happy to be part of this team,"" Seager said. ""We grind it and play through it. It's awesome right now.""After Texas left the bases loaded in the eighth, Josh Jung and Lowe singled to open the ninth for the Rangers and both scored on an error by Arizona's Alek Thomas on Heim's single to make it 3-0. Semien then blasted a two-run homer into the left-field seats for a 5-0 Rangers lead to all but settle matters.When Josh Sborz struck out Ketel Marte for the final out, ending the Arizona batter's 20-game playoff hit streak, the Rangers began a wild celebration. ""We weren't going to let up until the last out was made,"" Heim said. ""We fought hard. We came out on top.""Bruce Bochy, who came out of retirement last year to manage the Rangers, won his fourth World Series title at age 68 after three with San Francisco. ""To get this call, to be a part of this, I know how blessed I am,"" Bochy said. ""I can't thank these guys enough."" The Rangers had missed the playoffs in six consecutive losing seasons before this year's title run.Arizona advanced runners into scoring position in each of the first five innings but came away empty-handed, going 0-for-10 at the plate with those runners on second or third base. The D-backs then stranded runners at first base in the seventh and eighth innings as well.Rangers US right-handed starting pitcher Nathan Eovaldi, who threw six scoreless innings, was the best in the American League this season at denying hits with runners in scoring position and he mystified the D-backs when it mattered early. In the fifth, Arizona loaded the bases on walks to Ketel Marte and Tommy Pham and a Christian Walker two-out single, but Lourdes Gurriel grounded out and another perfect scoring opportunity slipped away.",/en/sports/
World Cup 2034: Football players remain completely silent on human rights violations in Saudi Arabia,"    The monarchy has attracted a range of stars to its league and now looks set to host the 2034 World Cup. At the heart of this powerful sporting soft power movement, players and governing bodies never express views on the kingdom's politics. ","""Morally, it wouldn't make sense."" In February, the American football player Alex Morgan, her compatriot Megan Rapinoe and Dutchwoman Vivianne Miedema publicly protested against the prospect of the 2023 edition of the Women's World Cup (July 20-August 20) being sponsored by the Saudi Arabian Tourist Board.When it negotiated this lucrative contract, FIFA had not anticipated this outcry. Nor did it anticipate the protests of the Australian and New Zealand federations, co-hosts of the tournament, who wrote to FIFA expressing their disapproval of the partnership. Under pressure, FIFA president Gianni Infantino declared a month later that ""discussions with Visit Saudi"" had, in the end, ""not led to an agreement."" It was an announcement that sounded like a victory for the rebels.But Saudi Arabia has many other trump cards to play. In recent years, sports have become a weapon of mass attraction for the Gulf monarchy. The world's leading oil power organizes major boxing and equestrian events, a world golf circuit and an annual Formula 1 race. In 2029, it will host the Asian Games in Neom, a futuristic megalopolis under construction in the middle of the desert.On Tuesday, October 31, FIFA announced that the Saudi kingdom was the only candidate in the running to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup. The future host country of one of the most watched sporting events on the planet is due to be made official at the end of 2024, but the outcome is already almost beyond doubt.To make its local league globally attractive, Saudi Arabia has relied on the four major clubs of the Saudi Pro League. These are 75% owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), one of the world's richest sovereign wealth funds, already a majority shareholder in England's Newcastle United football club.Karim Benzema, Sadio Mané, Neymar, Kalidou Koulibaly and Riyad Mahrez: In the space of a summer, a host of stars have joined the local league, following in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo, who six months earlier had signed for Al-Nassr, one of two teams in the capital city of Riyadh. These investments, numbering in the billions, are part of the ""Vision 2030"" plan, launched in 2016 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as ""MBS,"" and designed to prepare for the post-oil era.MBS is a reformer with two faces: modernizer and despot. On the one hand, he has expanded moral boundaries by granting fundamental rights to women, such as the right to drive, and by allowing public concerts and cinema. On the other hand, he stifles all forms of political protest.",/en/sports/
New York City Marathon: The dark side of the race,"This weekend, 50,000 people will take to the starting line of the New York City Marathon on Staten Island. A crowd that poses major environmental challenges – pee breaks among them.","This Sunday, runners in the New York Marathon will start from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which links Staten Island to Brooklyn and, since 1976, marks the beginning of a race that crosses the city's five boroughs. The location provides spectacular aerial views.But apart from the striking effect of seeing 50,000 participants on a suspension bridge, it's understandable that the camera would want to stay high up at marathon starts: The ground is often disgusting. The runners who start last have to watch their feet to avoid tripping over all the things thrown away by the earlier starters: Sweatshirts, garbage bags, energy gel wrappers and even bottles filled with urine rolling around on the pavement. Yes, you read that right.In New York, the problems posed by poor planning of pre-race fluid consumption are more acute than in other major marathons: the outlying starting point means you need to be taken there several hours in advance, either by ferry or by one of the three hundred buses operating for the occasion. Right from this first challenge of the day, it is not uncommon to hear participants begging for access to a toilet as quickly as possible.With the starting groups distributed over the two levels of the suspension bridge, for a long time, rumor had it that those starting from the lower deck were liable to be splashed by runners relieving themselves from the upper deck. Be it to silence the urban legend or to justify a $300 entry fee, the New York Marathon has steadily increased the number of porta-potties set up at the start (over 1,500 this year), while event partner Dunkin' Donuts is responsible for distributing 50,000 coffees and 6,000 teas at the start to runners whose bladders are already running on empty.There will always be participants who refuse to use the porta-potties to avoid losing strategic places in the starting group. Some have previously been seen donning a garbage bag with holes for the arms as a raincoat, and squatting to relieve themselves at the start, surrounded by runners whose feet they have just urinated on. The organizers have had to write a rule clarifying that ""anyone who is seen urinating or defecating in a corral may be disqualified.""As the marathon takes place in November, participants often pack extra clothes to keep warm until the start of the race, which they discard – at best when setting out, at worst within the first few kilometers. Like most major marathons which are criticized for the pollution they cause, the New York marathon has stated for years that discarded items are donated to charity.",/en/sports/
PSG beats Montpellier to go top of Ligue 1,    Reigning champions PSG moved two points clear of Nice of Friday after a defiant 3-0 win at the Parc de Princes. ,"Paris Saint-Germain beat Montpellier 3-0 to climb provisionally top of France's Ligue 1 on Friday, November 3, with Ousmane Dembélé providing much of the ammunition. Luis Enrique's new-look PSG seem to be clicking into gear with Lee Kang-in, Warren Zaïre-Emery and Vitinha bagging the goals in a dominant win. Reigning champions PSG moved two points clear of Nice at the top.""What I see is positive, the objective is to continue to be effective in each match and improve,"" said coach Luis Enrique. ""I undoubtedly saw at the Parc des Princes this evening one of the most beautiful PSG performances (since the start of the season).""Lee's left-foot shot into the top corner on 10 minutes opened the tally and sparked joy after Kylian Mbappé set him up with a clever dummy. ""He is very likeable for any supporter,"" Luis Enrique said of South Korean international Lee. ""He is young, makes an effort in attack and defense, makes very good decisions and is hungry to play.""Mbappé was largely kept quiet by some robust defending ahead of PSG's visit to AC Milan in the Champions League in midweek. Just before the hour mark, Zaïre-Emery made it 2-0 after a back-heel from Dembélé left the 17-year-old in space on the edge of the six-yard box for a nerveless finish.Substitute Vitinha scored with almost his first touch, slamming home from the edge of the area as goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte dived the right way marginally too late. Dembélé himself came close on 26 minutes and Mbappé, who scored his 250th and 251st goals for the club last week, was wasteful from an ensuing corner. Mbappé nodded one in late on but walked away laughing sheepishly because he was so far offside.Having started their European campaign with a 2-0 home win against Borussia Dortmund, PSG lost at Newcastle but top Group F with six points ahead of their trip to Milan in the Champions League after beating the Italians last week.On Saturday all eyes will be on Marseille's match against Lille, a week after the Lyon bus was pelted with heavy objects by OM fans, one of which left Lyon coach Fabio Grosso with a serious facial injury that caused the game to be called off.Nice can climb back on top of the league when they host Rennes on Sunday with third-placed Monaco hosting Brest the same evening.",/en/sports/
Football: Real Madrid denies reports about Mbappé negotiations,    The club denied Saturday that they are in negotiations to sign Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappé at the end of his contract in June 2024 after recent reports suggested they were in talks. ,"Real Madrid denied Saturday, November 4, that they are in negotiations to sign Paris Saint-Germain striker Kylian Mbappé at the end of his contract in June 2024 after recent reports suggested they were in talks.""In view of the information issued and published recently by different media outlets, in which there is speculation about alleged negotiations between the player Kylian Mbappé and our club, Real Madrid wishes to state that this information is categorically false and that no such negotiations have taken place with a player who belongs to PSG,"" said Madrid in a statement.Spanish newspaper Marca said Thursday that Madrid envisages Mbappé joining the club next year, with the squad believing ""he will land at the Santiago Bernabeu"". Mbappé has been courted by Madrid for several years but turned Los Blancos down by signing a new contract with PSG in May 2022 despite reports he had agreed to join Real Madrid.In the summer, Mbappé was frozen out by PSG until August 13 after refusing to extend his contract.The 24-year-old was not invited to the pre-season tour in Japan and South Korea and missed the French champions' first Ligue 1 match during the dispute. Mbappé was eventually brought back into the fold after holding ""constructive and positive discussions"" with the club.",/en/sports/
Djokovic beats Dimitrov for seventh Paris Masters title,"    Novak Djokovic won 6-4, 6-3 to clinch his 40th Masters 1000 title, and stretching his winning run to 18 matches. ","Novak Djokovic defeated Grigor Dimitrov 6-4, 6-3 in Sunday's final to win a record-extending seventh Paris Masters title and close in on securing the year-end number one ranking for an eighth time. The 36-year-old Djokovic eclipsed his previous record set two years ago as the tournament's oldest champion, capturing his 40th Masters 1000 title and stretching his winning run to 18 matches.Djokovic collected his sixth title of the season to draw level with Carlos Alcaraz, adding to the Masters victory in Cincinnati that set him up for a landmark 24th Grand Slam singles crown at the US Open. He will take a 1,490-point lead over Alcaraz into the season-ending ATP Finals in Turin later this month. Djokovic won the tournament for the sixth time last year after Alcaraz withdrew because of injury.""It's incredible. To be able to win it after quite challenging circumstances for me this week,"" said Djokovic, who was hit by a stomach virus that left him feeling under the weather in Paris. He was taken to three sets in each of his three previous rounds but didn't face a single break point against the 17th-ranked Dimitrov.""Basically, coming back from the brink of losing three matches in a row, on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I was very close to losing those matches and somehow managed to find an extra gear when it was needed,"" said Djokovic. ""I think the match was closer than the scoreline indicates, but another amazing win for me. I'm very proud of this one, considering what I've been through this week.""Dimitrov, 32, was chasing his first title in Paris since winning the ATP Finals in 2017 but suffered a 10th straight loss to Djokovic in a meeting of the two oldest players in the top 20.""I think I'm running out of words for Novak,"" said Dimitrov, whose late-season resurgence had seen him beat Daniil Medvedev, Hubert Hurkacz and Stefanos Tsitsipas this week. ""I just want to say how grateful I am for this amazing week. It's been such a rollercoaster for me the past three months.""The pair held serve largely untroubled until Djokovic landed the first blow at 3-3 in the opening set, when Dimitrov gave his rival his first glimpse with a forehand that drifted long. Dimitrov produced a crunching serve that a scrambling Djokovic could only return shallow into the court, but the Bulgarian dumped his backhand into the net to concede the break. Djokovic followed it up with an easy hold and wrapped up the set in the 10th game on his second set point, after Dimitrov scrapped his way back to deuce before spearing a backhand wide.The second set went on serve before Djokovic's greater consistency told once more, Dimitrov coughing up another break point with a wild forehand and then effectively sealing his fate with an errant backhand. Djokovic consolidated his cushion with another routine hold, and while Dimitrov saved a break point at 2-4, it only delayed the inevitable. Dimitrov clawed his way to 30-all on his opponent's serve in the eighth game but his brave resistance soon ended, Djokovic holding and then going on to break again in the ensuing game to seal his 97th career title.",/en/sports/
Paris FC's gamble: Free tickets for all until the end of the season,"    The club, whose men's team competes in Ligue 2 and women's team in Division 1, has announced that 15,000 of the 17,000 seats at Stade Charléty will be available free of charge for all league matches until the end of the season. ","Starting on November 11, you won't need to pull out your wallet to attend a professional football match in Paris. At Stade Charléty, Paris FC's league matches will now be free of charge, the club's president club announced on Friday, November 3. The new ticketing policy applies to both the men's team in Ligue 2 and the women's team, which is currently joint-top of Division 1 and has qualified for this season's Women's Champions League.Until the end of the 2023-2024 season, 15,000 of the stadium's 17,000 seats will be available for free, excluding only VIP packages, premium seats, and the away end. ""This is a first in Europe and even in the world for a professional club,"" Paris FC claimed in a press release.The club's president, Pierre Ferraci, said the aim is twofold: ""To recapture the popular essence of football by making it accessible to as many people as possible,"" and ""to increase the level of attendance at Stade Charléty."" The club hopes to attract new fans to the stadium – which had long been derided for being oversized and having a chilly atmosphere.Attendance is a key factor in attracting new investors, but the question will be whether it compensates for the shortfall in ticket sales, which the club has estimated at ""one million euros over the year.""Freebies are not a complete novelty in professional football: There are one-off operations, invitations, and contests to win tickets. But this is the first time the idea is applied so widely and so openly: at Stade Charléty, all matches will be free, apart from Coupe de France and Women's Champions League, due to rules specific to those competitions.Fortuna Düsseldorf, in Germany's second division, had previously experimented with a similar approach, but less ambitiously. The club announced last April that tickets for at least three of its matches would be free of charge, and has planned to make them completely free over the next five years.On October 21, for this new model's premiere, over 52,000 fans packed into the Merkur Spiel Arena, well above the usual attendance of 29,300. The increase is encouraging for Paris FC, which has an average attendance of 4,135 fans, or 24% of capacity.The Parisian club's situation is ideal for such an experiment: it has a venue capable of hosting a much larger number of spectators than it currently does, and the drop in ticketing revenue will not be a hard blow. Ticket sales only account for 4% of the club's budget, compared with an average of 8 to 10% among other clubs in Ligue 2.""We're not taking a big risk, and we won't lose out,"" said Feracci. ""The balance will be positive, thanks to new sponsorship income and the arrival of new shareholders who have shown themselves to be keen on our vision. I'm confident that we'll soon have a third shareholder from the CAC 40 [stock index].""Luc Arrondel, an economist specializing in football, agreed: ""Good attendance means greater visibility for sponsors, and therefore greater attractiveness for the club, which will be able to generate revenue and finance its sporting campaign."" This strategy has also been adopted by the club, which now targets a wider audience by offering events alongside the match itself. ""Better attendance at home also means better sporting results, with a crowd that encourages its players and pushes them to excel,"" added Arrondel.In his study ""Faut-il payer les supporters?"" (""Should fans be paid?""), the economist questions whether supporters should be rewarded for their preponderant role in a team's performance, which in turn affects the club's main source of revenue, TV rights. That notion is still a long way off, but just a few years ago, this model of free tickets for a season also seemed impossible.Could the model become widespread? ""In Ligue 1, ticketing plays a more important role, accounting for around 10 to 15% of [team] budgets,"" said Arrondel. ""At a PSG [Paris Saint-Germain] match, for example, it represents 50% of the evening's revenue. It really depends on the club, so it's difficult to generalize. We've noticed that it's mainly second-division clubs that are venturing into this area."" Feracci confirmed this: ""If we go up to Ligue 1, which is our objective, the question will come up again.""But first, see you on November 11 at the Stade Charléty, for the 14th matchweek of Ligue 2, when Paris FC will host Bastia for the first match of this new era of free tickets.",/en/sports/
"Ethiopia's Tola, Kenya's Obiri the winners at New York City Marathon","    Tamirat Tola won the men's race in a time of 2:4:58, a course record. Reigning Boston Marathon champion Hellen Obiri won the women's race in 2:27:23. ","Tamirat Tola of Ethiopia set a course record to win the New York City Marathon men's race on Sunday, November 5, while Hellen Obiri of Kenya pulled away in the final 400 meters to take the women's title.Tola finished in 2 hours, 4 minutes and 58 seconds, topping the 2:05:06 set by Geoffrey Mutai in 2011. Tola pulled away from countrymate Jemel Yimer when the pair were heading towards the Bronx at mile 20. By the time he headed back into Manhattan a mile later, he was up by 19 seconds and chasing Mutai's mark. Kenya's Albert Korir was second with Ethiopia's Shura Kitata third.While the men’s race was well decided before the last few miles, the women’s race came down to the stretch. Obiri, Letesenbet Gidey of Ethiopia and defending champion Sharon Lokedi of Kenya were all running together exchanging the lead. Obiri made a move as the trio headed back into Central Park for the final half-mile and finished in 2:27:23. Gidey finished second, 6 seconds behind. Lokedi was 10 seconds behind Obiri, who won the Boston Marathon in April.This was a stellar women's field that was expected to potentially take down the course record of 2:22:31 set by Margaret Okayo in 2003. Unlike last year when the weather was unseasonably warm with temperatures in the 20 degrees Celsius, Sunday’s race was much cooler with it being in the low 10°s — ideal conditions for record-breaking times.Instead, the women had a tactical race with 11 runners, including Americans Kellyn Taylor and Molly Huddle in the lead pack for the first 20 miles. Taylor and Huddle both led the group at points before falling back and finishing in eighth and ninth.Once the lead group came back into Manhattan for the final few miles, Obiri, Gidey and Lokedi pushed the pace. As the trio entered Central Park they further distanced themselves from Kenya's Brigid Kosgei, who finished fourth.The men's and women's winners finished within a few minutes of each other. About an hour earlier, Marcel Hug won the men’s wheelchair race, finishing a few seconds short of his own course record by finishing in 1:25:29. It was the Swiss star’s record-extending sixth NYC Marathon victory. ""It’s incredible. I think it takes some time to realize what happened,"" Hug said. ""I’m so happy as well."" He’s the most decorated champion in the wheelchair race at the event, breaking a tie with Tatyana McFadden and Kurt Fearnley for most wins in the division in event history.Catherine Debrunner of Switzerland won her New York debut, shattering the course record in the women's wheelchair race. She finished in 1:39:32, besting the previous mark by over 3 minutes, which was held by American Susannah Scaroni. ""It’s difficult to describe in words. I said to my coach if I win this race, it’s the best performance I ever showed,"" she said. ""Knew it’s the toughest marathon of all. It was the first time. I knew it was going to be so tough.""Debrunner and Tola both earned a $50,000 bonus for topping the previous course records.",/en/sports/
Champions League: AC Milan get crucial win over PSG,    Frenchman Olivier Giroud scored the decisive goal for the Italian side as they picked up a pivotal 2-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain at the San Siro to stay alive in Group F. ,"Olivier Giroud fired AC Milan back into Champions League contention with the decisive goal in a 2-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, November 7. France striker Giroud thumped home a trademark header four minutes after the break at a pulsating San Siro to reignite Milan's chances of reaching the last 16 and turn around a dreadful recent run of form.Stefano Pioli's team started the day bottom of Group F but are now well in contention for the knockout stages, third on five points and just one behind PSG who occupy the second qualification spot. Tuesday's win was revenge for a 3-0 hammering in Paris a fortnight ago and came with Milan's first goals in the competition this season, the hugely impressive Rafael Leao drawing the hosts level in the 12th minute after former Inter Milan defender Milan Skriniar had nodded PSG into an early lead.Giroud's winner was his seventh goal of the season in all competitions and there was a French flavor to the finish that downed Ligue 1 champions PSG, Theo Hernandez supplying the pinpoint cross from which his Les Bleus teammate netted. Milan next face group leaders Borussia Dortmund, who took the top spot by one point from PSG with their 2-0 win over Newcastle United earlier on Tuesday, in a match which could well be crucial to their chances of getting out of the group.Their fans also got revenge on public enemy number one Gianluigi Donnarumma who controversially left Milan for PSG as a free agent two years ago and was greeted with a wave of hate from the packed stands. A day that started with the news that a PSG fan had been stabbed in clashes between both sets of supporters late on Monday night reached fever pitch when the teams took to the field and home fans unloaded on Italy goalkeeper Donnarumma. Milan fans printed thousands of fake dollar bills depicting his face with the word ""mercenary"" and the disparaging nickname ""Dollarumma.""They were launched onto the field after the traditional pre-match display amid loud, insulting chants toward Donnarumma, which only got louder as he had to walk toward the goal nearest Milan's hardcore fans just before kick-off. Some fans rolled the bills into hard balls and pelted them onto the pitch, where they pinged off the grass just by where he was standing.Once the match was finally up and running it was Milan who should have taken the lead first when Ruben Loftus-Cheek smashed a great chance over the bar after Leao's blazing run and cut-back. Skriniar had the away side ahead three minutes later after Loftus-Cheek allowed him to drift away and easily nod in Marquinhos' flick-on from a corner.But Leao was clearly up for it after a series of underwhelming recent performances and another of his trademark bursts brought Milan level almost immediately. The Portugal winger charged down the middle, offloaded to Giroud and after his shot was parried by Donnarumma, flicked in the leveler with an acrobatic overhead kick.PSG was dangerous on almost every attack and, after Mike Maignan had to be quick off his line to stop Kylian Mbappe twice, Ousmane Dembele thwacked the crossbar in the 27th minute. Seconds later Giroud smashed into the side netting after Loftus-Cheek's powerful dribble in a breathless opening period which nearly finished with Milan deservedly ahead when Leao drilled just wide of Donnarumma's near post.Giroud had his moment of glory with a classic center-forward header from Theo Hernandez's cross after Leao nearly poked home. PSG were livid at what they thought was a foul on Achraf Hakimi from Leao, who was still on the ground when Giroud thumped home what turned out to be the winner.Donnarumma denied Milan a more convincing victory when he brilliantly tipped wide Noah Okafor's angled drive with five minutes left. And Lee Kang-in almost made Milan pay when he cut inside and slammed the post in a tense finale which ended with a massive roar of relief at the final whistle.",/en/sports/
French Alps launch bid for 2030 Winter Olympics,"    France, which is hosting the Summer Olympics in 2024 and has hosted the Winter Games three times, would spread the competition among sites across the Alps. ","With Paris about to stage the 2024 Summer Olympics, France officially launched a bid on Tuesday, November 7, for the 2030 Winter Games, spread over sites with existing infrastructure from Nice to the Haute-Savoie.Nice would host the Olympic village, media center and indoor skating events, meaning an ice rink would have to be built at the coastal city. The ski resort Méribel-Courchevel would host the alpine skiing events. Isola 2000, just a 90-minute drive from Nice, would host the snowboard competitions. And the Grand-Bornand is earmarked for the Nordic events.The head of the French Olympic Committee David Lappartient and President of the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur region Renaud Muselier promised the bid would be 95% based on existing sites when they outlined their proposals.Switzerland and Sweden have already declared themselves candidates and France is keen to avoid running over a proposed budget of €1.5 billion.""We will trim down this budget,"" Lappartient, also head of the International Cycling Union, said. ""The world is changing and we need to change too, there is no room for white elephants. As with Paris, we are seeking a durable legacy on viable economic terms to reflect the changing world.""A decision on the hosts for the 2030 and 2034 Winter Games will be made most likely in July 2024.France has hosted the Winter Games three times: at Chamonix in 1924, Grenoble in 1968 and Albertville in 1992.""We have a great chance of winning because of our skiing facilities.

Olympics 2024: French Polynesia president suggests replanning surfing venue,"    Following local opposition to the construction of a metal tower for judges at the famous surfing venue of Teahupo'o, President Moetai Brotherson suggested Taharuu Beach as an alternative. ","The president of the French overseas territory of French Polynesia has suggested an alternative venue for the 2024 Olympics surf competition after plans for a gigantic tower at a planned venue in Tahiti site caused uproar.Surfers are due to catch the first waves of the Paris Games in nine months in Tahiti, some 15,000 kilometers from the French capital, but a plan to build a giant tower in a legendary surf spot is sparking resistance. The organizers of the 2024 Games want to erect a 14-meter aluminum structure in the water for judges to better assess the competition.Local associations have led protests against the tower, saying its installation would damage corals beyond repair. Several hundred people recently joined a peaceful protest at the site near the village of Teahupo'o – one of the world's most famous surfing areas and the designated Olympic venue. An online petition against the project has attracted close to 150,000 signatures.Moetai Brotherson, President of French Polynesia – which comprises more than 100 islands including Tahiti – told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday, November 7, that he shared the environmental concerns, and suggested a different spot for the competition, without the need for a tower.While less well-known than the original venue, the site at Taharuu Beach on Tahiti's west coast was more accessible and already had all the necessary infrastructure on land, he said on the sidelines of a Pacific islands forum on the Cook Islands. Taharuu had been in the running previously but, Brotherson said, ""that choice wasn't possible at the time."" However, he said, ""given the stakes and the protests today, perhaps we could revisit that option."" He said drilling for the tower's foundations would not be possible without ""breaking corals.""Brotherson, who supports independence from France, took up his post in the wake of elections this year won by pro-independence forces who want to negotiate a referendum with Paris on the archipelago's status. French Polynesia is one of several French overseas territories that span the Caribbean and the Pacific and give Paris a global footprint unmatched by any other European nation.Surfing made its bow as an Olympic sport at the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games, when it was held on Tsurigasaki Beach on mainland Japan, and France was keen to keep it on the roster. France's Atlantic coast hosts some of Europe's most famous surfing beaches and local officials had been hopeful of hosting the event.When Tahiti was announced, dignitaries in coastal resorts like Biarritz were unimpressed – not least because of the cost and the carbon emissions involved in putting a chunk of the Olympics on in the South Pacific. The tower alone is expected to cost around 4.4 million euros ($4.7 million).",/en/sports/

","Over three weeks since their quarter-final exit at the hands of South Africa, France coach Fabien Galthié finally opened up on Wednesday, November 8, about the ""scar that will stay with us for life.""Hosts France were one of the favorites to win the tournament but lost a thrilling quarter-final 29-28 to the eventual champions. ""For us, it was a time of mourning,"" said Galthié, who had not spoken to the press since the night of the loss on October 15. ""It's a huge disappointment after four years of hard work, four years of successful work with 80% wins and all those records. ""The only objective we wanted to achieve was to be world champions. There was no other. It would have been the same disappointment if we'd lost in the semi-final by one point,"" he said. The difference is that we would have had an extra week.

2030 Winter Olympics: France vows to host 'the first sustainable Olympics',"    The bid submitted by the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur regions, which will use 95% existing infrastructure, was officially submitted to the International Olympic Committee on Tuesday. ","The news is now official. France is a candidate to host the 2030 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. On Tuesday, November 7, the French National Olympic and Sports Committee (CNOSF) submitted the bid submitted by the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (southeast-central) and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (southeastern) regions to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). CNOSF President David Lappartient unveiled the main principles at the Maison du sport français in Paris along with the presidents of the two regional governments, Laurent Wauquiez and Renaud Muselier, and the head of the Paralympic Committee (CPSF), Marie-Amélie Le Fur.""The French Alps are the most beautiful natural setting for reviving the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. The memories of Albertville [1992] are still very strong,"" said Wauquiez enthusiastically. ""We were the last out of the starting gate [compared with rival bids from Switzerland and Sweden], but we hope to be the first to arrive,"" added Lappartient optimistically, who stated during the summer that France ""has a real chance. The timing is right and our infrastructures are very attractive.""Yet the timing is surprising. Hastily put together over the summer, France's bid for the 2030 Winter Olympics comes at a time before the Paris 2024 Games have even begun. With two events so closely scheduled in time, it is reasonable to question France's chances of winning. But Salt Lake City, which was initially a candidate for the 2030 Games, is due to organize the 2034 Games, just six years after the Los Angeles 2028 Summer Games, as part of the double awarding of the Games approved by the IOC. The proximity between consecutive events no longer seems to be an obstacle for the Lausanne-based body when it comes to awarding events.France, which hosted the Winter Games in 1924 in Chamonix, in 1968 in Grenoble and in 1992 Albertville, is promising to organize ""simple and responsible"" Games – ""the first sustainable Olympics"" – in winter 2030, thanks to its use of 95% existing infrastructure, as Wauquiez pointed out. The head of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region wants to ""make the French Alps the first sustainable mountains in the world,"" and the Games will be a ""catalyst"" to help them achieve this.The 2030 project, with an estimated budget of €1.5 billion – ""no higher than Milan-Cortina in 2026,"" promised Lappartient – calls for the construction of just one facility, an ice rink in Nice, where the ice events (field hockey, curling, figure skating) will be held. The various venues for the Games are divided into four geographical hubs, namely Haute-Savoie (eastern), Savoie (southeastern), Briançonnais (southeastern) and Nice Côte d'Azur (southern).",/en/sports/

","Paris Saint-Germain's highly-rated teenager Warren Zaïre-Emery was called up by France coach Didier Deschamps for the first time on Thursday, November 9.Aged 17, the PSG academy product has been in impressive form since the start of the season despite intense competition in midfield at his club. He has scored two goals and delivered two assists in 10 league matches, and caught the eye last month on Europe's biggest stage with two assists as PSG beat AC Milan 3-0 in the Champions League.""He's here with us because he's got what it takes to perform at the very highest level, even if there is competition at his position,"" Deschamps said. ""What he is capable of achieving with his club at such a young age shows an enormous potential and maturity.""Zaïre-Emery has been called up for upcoming European qualifiers against Gibraltar and Greece. France is already qualified for next year's tournament in Germany and will look to secure top spot in Group B. France hosts Gibraltar on November 18 in the city of Nice and then takes on Greece in Athens three days later.Before his first call-up for the senior team, Zaïre-Emery had captained the under-21 team managed by former France and Arsenal great Thierry Henry.The teenager joined PSG's youth academy in 2014 and won the Euros with the France under-17 team. Former PSG coach Christophe Galtier gave Zaïre-Emery his French league debut last season when he became the youngest player in the club's history.He was included in Deschamps' 23-man squad in the absence of injured Real Madrid midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, but the France coach said he could have been on the list anyway.Goalkeepers: Alphonse Areola (West Ham), Mike Maignan (AC Milan), Brice Samba (Lens)Defenders: Jonathan Clauss (Marseille), Lucas Hernandez (PSG), Theo Hernandez (AC Milan), Ibrahima Konaté (Liverpool), Jules Koundé (Barcelona), William Saliba (Arsenal), Jean-Clair Todibo (Nice), Dayot Upamecano (Bayern Munich)Midfielders: Eduardo Camavinga (Real Madrid), Youssouf Fofana (Monaco), Boubacar Kamara (Aston Villa), Adrien Rabiot (Juventus), Warren Zaïre-Emery (PSG)Forwards: Kingsley Coman (Bayern Munich), Ousmane Dembélé (PSG), Olivier Giroud (AC Milan), Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid), Randal Kolo Muani (PSG), Kylian Mbappé (PSG), Marcus Thuram (Inter Milan)",/en/sports/
Paris tests dismantling of iconic bookstalls ahead of 2024 Olympics ceremony,"    On Friday, four secondhand bookstalls on the banks of the Seine will be dismantled and reassembled to test whether they can be moved in July 2024, before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games on the Seine. ","On Friday, November 10, Paris City Hall is planning to carry out ""a feasibility test to dismantle, empty, reassemble and reinstall a set of four bouquiniste [bookseller] stands and their contents."" The operation is part of the Paris Police Prefecture's strategy to secure the banks of the Seine during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games on July 26, 2024.Starting at 8:15 pm – weather permitting – this test, similar to putting an old Ikea wardrobe back together, will take place between the Tournelle and Sully bridges. According to the Cultural Association of Paris Bouquinistes, the goal is to help the city hall to decide ""whether or not to remove the bouquiniste stands located on the river route"" of the opening ceremony in July.In a working document dated October 23, Paris City Hall envisaged that 500 to 700 bookstalls would be removed between July 13 and 18, depending on the security perimeter selected, and then reinstalled from August 3. The service provider will be chosen based on its ability to ""work with fragile objects (books, but also small antiques, posters, engravings, etc.) and on stands that are sometimes badly damaged,"" whose weight, including contents, is estimated at 250 kilograms each. The city has already identified ""around 100 stands in poor condition"" which ""will have to be repaired.""It's an understatement to say that the bouquinistes are vehemently opposed to such a removal. They have brandished a petition of support, ""Saving the Seine bouquinistes,"" which has gathered over 173,000 signatures as of November 8. The 200 booksellers are awaiting the results of the test, but are ready to launch an interim proceeding before the Paris administrative court in December.For Friday, the city has commissioned a custom-built base for each of the four bookstalls. But there's no guarantee that this will be the case for all of them. ""The idea for this test did not come from us,"" explained Jérôme Callais, president of the Cultural Association of Paris Bouquinistes. ""Our only hope is to demonstrate that the operation isn't feasible."" He fears that some of the dark green bookstalls, which are as much a part of Paris's heritage as Guimard metro entrances or Wallace fountains, will not survive this treatment − and that City Hall will replace them with something ugly.According to him, ""while the Police Prefecture is doing its job, Paris City Hall is getting out a bazooka to kill a mosquito. When Charles III or the Pope pass along the banks (of the Seine) or when the Tour de France arrives, we're not asked to do anything. For the opening ceremony of the Olympics, all we need to do is close the stands the day of and put a security barrier in front of them.""",/en/sports/

","The Musée d'Orsay is tuning in to the Cultural Olympiad and the Olympic Games. With just nine months to go, the Parisian institution is entering the fray of ""art and sport"" events, which are poised to become the theme of the season for many venues and events. ""We will be at the heart of the plan with the construction of a stadium on Place de la Concorde which will host basketball, skateboarding and breaking,"" said Antonine Fulla, director of cultural programming and auditoriums at the Musée d'Orsay. The opening ceremony on the Seine will pass right in front of our premises. It seemed only natural to participate in our own way.""With breaking, an acrobatic hip-hop style appearing for the first time at the Olympic Games, the entire urban dance scene is enjoying a media boost. Until June 22, a series of shows and walkabouts will punctuate the exhibitions. On Saturday, November 11, and Sunday, November 12, star choreographer Mourad Merzouki, whose Kalypso festival runs until December 23 in 23 towns and cities across the Paris region, takes over various spaces. ""It's the first time – for Mourad– that we are holding a so-called 'open museum', offering him every possible venue for him to cross through,"" said Fulla. ""Between 2 and 6 pm, the 13,000 visitors expected on average each day will be able to enjoy choreographic pastilles, according to their mood, scattered throughout the museum.""From the imposing and majestic grand nave, where a cable and elastic bands have been installed for aerial sequences from the show Vertikal, to the Salle des fêtes, gleaming in its crystal chandeliers (which can be entered exceptionally to see the baroque Folia), to the Fumoir with its square of tables conducive to free improvisations, 10 venues will serve as the setting for some 10 excerpts from five shows by Merzouki. ""These are, as it were, singular scenographies that you have to live up to, and for which dance can provide a new reading,"" he commented.In front of Gustave Courbet's monumental and always breathtaking painting Le Rut du printemps. Combat de cerfs, Merzouki embeds a compact block from Boxe Boxe, created in 2010, as well as on the immense model of the Paris Opéra neighborhood, installed at the rear of the nave. The transparent glass floor is transformed into an astonishing, vertiginous natural base for a surge of bodies between stage and ring.

"At the Pole Summit, Emmanuel Macron hones his climate diplomacy ahead of COP28","    After tough negotiations, 32 countries signed the 'Paris Call for Glaciers and Poles' on Friday, expressing alarm at the situation of polar ice caps and explaining that 200,000 glaciers are threatened with 'almost irreversible retreat.' ","Talking about the fate of the poles and the cryosphere at a time when the world is torn apart by conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East wasn't easy. This week, despite the geopolitical crises, Emmanuel Macron held his Peace Forum, a cycle of meetings covering a wide range of themes, including the situation of the civilian population in Gaza, digital technology and artificial intelligence, and the situation of glaciers and ice floes, sentinels of climate change.On Friday, the French president concluded the One Planet Polar Summit with a speech at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (Museum of Natural History) in Paris. ""We are in a multi-crisis world where everything is connected and interrelated,"" Macron told scientists and government leaders gathered in the Grande Galerie de l’Evolution. ""The subjects of biodiversity and climate (...) are the subjects of tomorrow's crises, and they are inseparable from the hottest security issues we face today. We will avoid tomorrow's misfortunes by doing this. Our duty is not to deviate from this agenda.""Gathered since Wednesday, the scientific community from some 40 countries drew up an assessment of a world in danger. Climate change is three times faster in Arctic regions, and at least half the world's glaciers are set to disappear even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.Noting that 1 billion people are threatened by rising sea levels, Macron spoke of an ""unprecedented"" and ""civilizational"" challenge for humanity. And he pledged to mobilize €1 billion to support polar research. His ambition is to build a polar ship bearing the name of Michel Rocard, the former French prime minister and a key player in Antarctic environmental protection.The money will also be used to finance two projects, explorer Jean-Louis Etienne's Polar Pod to study the Southern Ocean and the Tara Foundation's Arctic Station. Starting in 2026, France will rebuild its Dumont d'Urville station and work to renovate the French-Italian Concordia station, both in Antarctica.But the summit was also an important diplomatic rendezvous three weeks before the start of the 28th Conference of the Parties on Climate Change (COP28), to be held in Dubai from November 30 to December 12.

French MPs failed to declare trips paid by Qatar,"    The president of the France-Qatar friendship group failed to declare two trips to the emirate for the Football World Cup, in December 2022, and delayed doing so for a trip to the Qatar Formula 1 Grand Prix in October. Three other MPs are under similar scrutiny. ","An accomplished boxer, Christophe Naegelen is ""passionate about sport and competition."" The 39-year-old has been an MP for the LIOT group of miscellaneous independents since 2017, and the president of the France-Qatar friendship group at the Assemblée Nationale since 2022. He was invited as part of a ministerial and Elysée delegation to attend the quarter-finals and final of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in December 2022. Le Monde has learned he was also invited to Qatar at the beginning of October, and attended first practice sessions and then the race at the emirate's Formula 1 Grand Prix, on the Losail circuit.Before he was contacted by Le Monde on Wednesday, November 8, Naegelen had not yet officially declared these benefits and travels to the Assemblée Nationale's public register of invitations and trips accepted by MPs. He has confirmed that he has done so, after he spoked with Le Monde. The MP's three declarations were published on Thursday, November 9, with him acknowledging that he made two of them ""belatedly.""On May 30, Naegelen had duly declared in the public register another four-day trip to Doha in June, as part of the France-Qatar friendship group, paid for by the Qatari embassy in France.When contacted by Le Monde, the Assemblée Nationale replied, according to its regulations, elected members must declare, ""within one month of its reception, any donation, invitation to a sporting or cultural event or advantage"" as well as ""any acceptance of an invitation to travel, regardless of the third party, from which they have benefited as a result of their mandate. The declaration, made prior to the trip, must be accompanied by details of the travel plans and details of the travel arrangements.""""These general rules apply to the activities of MPs within the context of friendship groups. The value threshold has been set at 150 euros,"" said the Assemblée Nationale, adding that its ethics officer Jean-Eric Gicquel can monitor certain elected officials more closely in the event of a tip-off, and report breaches to the bureau of the Assemblée, the body that can take disciplinary action.Naegelen received a free seat at the stadium and free accommodation (for two nights) for the 2022 World Cup quarter-finals. Initially invited by the emirate, the MP was part of a delegation led by Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castera (whose accommodation was paid for by Qatar), which notably met with the International Labor Organization and the tournament's organizing committee. He claims to have paid for his round-trip flight using an advance on his parliamentary expense allowance.",/en/sports/
Paris 2024: Tahiti residents question Olympics' impact on surfing spot,"    The choice of Teahupo'o as the venue for the surfing event delighted fans. But many Tahitians are opposed to the construction of new infrastructure on this site for the Games, because of the irreparable damage to the coral reef ecosystem. ","The source of all the discord is the future aluminum tower intended for the Olympic Games judges and a few cameras. Because of the foundations that are to be drilled into the coral, it is the focus of all the opposition in Tahiti, where the surfing events of the Paris 2024 Olympics are due to take place. Environmentalists, surfers, local fishermen; all were hoping to keep the sturdy wooden tower that has officiated for two decades for the annual events of the World Surf League (WSL), the world surfing circuit, at Teahupo'o. ""Even during the 'code red' in 2011, with a series of 15-meter waves, the tower held,"" recalled Tahitian surfer Matahi Drollet, whose video against the aluminum tower, posted at the end of October on Instagram, spread the protests internationally.Until last month, opponents were keeping a low profile. The inhabitants of the small village of Teahupo'o, on the south coast of the Taiarapu peninsula, did express their concern when Paris 2024 selected their emblematic wave – one of the most beautiful on the planet. They live at PK0, point kilometer zero. Beyond that point, there is no road. Their village is the end of the world. Authentic Polynesia, far from the traffic jams of Papeete. A rural life, between fa'a'apu (agriculture) and fishing, at sea and in the lagoon. They were promptly reassured by the Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games (OCOG) that the work would respect their environment and that nothing would alter the character of their village.Teahupo'o's isolation was, however, a blow to the Games' environmental commitments: The athletes will be accommodated on a cruise ship anchored in Vairao Bay, just a stone's throw from the emblematic wave. In the absence of a nearby hotel, this was the only solution for accommodation within 45 minutes of the competition site, as required by the Olympic specifications.And then there was the tower. The old one wasn't up to Olympic standards; the new one had to have an air-conditioned server room, toilets, pipes in the lagoon for their evacuation, and fiber optics. But this tower is taller and twice as heavy as the previous one, so it needs more solid foundations, ones dug into the coral. Surfers fear irreparable destruction of the underwater topography that shapes their waves. If the coral is attacked, fishermen fear ciguatera, a disease transmitted by lagoon fish. As a result, several hundred residents of the peninsula demonstrated against the new tower on October 15.",/en/sports/

Migrant deaths in the Mediterranean have already exceeded 2022's death toll,    In graphs: The number of people reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean Sea since the start of 2023 is already higher than figures for each of the previous four years. ,"On Saturday, August 5, two migrant boats sank off the Italian island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean Sea. The deaths of a woman and a 2-year-old child were confirmed, and around thirty victims are missing. 57 people survived. The tragic crossing adds to the fatal attempts relayed by the press almost daily.The Lampedusa reception center is already saturated, with around 2,500 migrants filling its 600 places, according to the Italian Red Cross. This is due to the increase in asylum-seeker arrivals. In Italy, the main gateway to Europe, the United Nations High Council for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that 90,763 migrants arrived between January and August 2023, almost as many as the 105,131 recorded for the whole of 2022. In March 2023 alone, the UNHCR counted 13,267 entries into Italy, compared with 1,358 over the same period the previous year.Since the European migration crisis of 2014-2015, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has been keeping a census of migrants who have died, gone missing or survived in the course of their migration. The census counted migrants who died at the external borders of countries, or during the migration process to an international destination – whatever their legal status. Excluded from the figures are deaths in refugee camps, during expulsions, those resulting from labor exploitation or forced return to the country of origin, as well as the deaths of internally displaced persons. By definition, therefore, the IOM count is probably an underestimate. Nevertheless, the toll remains staggering: in nine years, more than 27,000 people have lost their lives in their attempt to reach Europe.After peaking in 2016, with over 5,000 deaths, the number of migrants dead or missing in the Mediterranean Sea stabilized at around 2,000 in 2018, before seeing a drop in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But, after just seven months, the 2023 toll is already heavier than those of the past four years.To reach Europe, the majority of migrants travel by sea, taking three maritime ""routes.""In almost two-thirds of cases, the IOM is unable to trace the region of origin of people who have died or gone missing at sea. Of the victims whose geographical origin is known, the majority are from sub-Saharan Africa. It is migrants from these countries who have for several weeks been the victims of violence (relocation, physical violence, expulsions and abandonment in the desert) committed by the Tunisian authorities.The UNHCR now has a clearer picture of the nationalities of asylum seekers arriving on European soil after crossing the Mediterranean. Since 2021, the majority have been Tunisians, Egyptians and Bangladeshis.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Judge recommends eight-month suspended term for French rugby player Chalureau over racist attack,"    Bastien Chalureau, a second-row lock who was part of France's Rugby World Cup squad earlier this year, was appealing a sentence for 'acts of violence that were 'committed because of the race or ethnicity of the victim.' ","A French judge recommended on Tuesday, March 14, that France lock Bastien Chalureau be handed an eight-month suspended prison sentence for a racially motivated attack in 2020.Second-row Chalureau, 31, who was part of France's Rugby World Cup squad earlier this year, was originally given a six-month suspended sentence but appealed. During his recommendations at the Toulouse Court of Appeal, the judge suggested a heavier sentence, two months longer than Chalureau's original one.""The facts have been established,"" the judge said before adding that the complainants ""spoke of undeniably racist remarks?"" The court's decision regarding the judge's recommendation is expected on January 16, 2024.""I greatly regret what I did, I am not racist,"" Chalureau, who admitted he had consumed a lot of beer, whiskey and vodka the evening of the attack, told the court. ""I have never made an inappropriate comment toward anyone. I have worked on myself with a psychologist, I've changed my lifestyle.""The court case overshadowed the start of France's World Cup campaign, before they were knocked out by eventual winners South Africa in the quarter-finals last month. Chalureau played just half an hour during the campaign after being called up to replace the injured Paul Willemse.Montpellier's Chalureau had accepted he attacked two other rugby players during a night out in January 2020 but denies using racist language during the incident. It took place in Toulouse, when Chalureau played for the town's top-flight club.In November 2020, a Toulouse court sentenced Chalureau to a suspended six-month prison sentence for ""acts of violence (...) committed because of the race or ethnicity of the victim."" Chalureau was sacked by Toulouse after the decision before joining their Top 14 rivals Montpellier.During the World Cup, former France captain Thierry Dusautoir said he had a problem with Chalureau's presence in the national team. Former Toulouse flanker Dusautoir is a close friend of one of the victims.French President Emmanuel Macron had said it would be preferable that Chalureau no longer played for France if his appeal failed. Some politicians had asked for Chalureau to be withdrawn from France's World Cup squad due to the incident.The decision is set to be announced less than three weeks before France's next game, when they start the 2024 Six Nations against Ireland on February 2 in Marseille.",/en/sports/
How dependent is France on Niger's uranium?,"    The military coup in Niger has raised concerns about uranium mining in the country by the French group Orano, and the consequences for France's energy independence. ","One week after the military coup in Niger led by General Abdourahamane Tiani, France completed the evacuation of 600 French nationals on Wednesday, August 2. This uncertain political context is also beginning to raise economic concerns.In France, fears are particularly focused on the exploitation of uranium from Niger, and the possible consequences of this energy independence. A natural resource essential to the operation of French nuclear power plants, uranium mined in Niger has been exploited for over four decades by the French nuclear fuel cycle group Orano (formerly Areva).The multinational, which is 90% owned by the French state, operates three mines in Niger, only one of which is currently in production:For the time being, Orano has announced that it will continue its mining activities, despite the putsch in Niger. ""To date, activities at the operational sites in Arlit and at the headquarters in Niamey are continuing with an adapted organization in the context of the curfew in place throughout Niger,"" the group announced on its website on Thursday, August 3.To operate the fifty-six nuclear reactors in France's eighteen power plants, operator EDF requires an average of around 8,000 tons of natural uranium every year. Following the cessation of mining on French soil in the early 2000s, France turned to several countries simultaneously for its supplies. The diversification of suppliers is a source of security for EDF.Over the last ten years, the 88,200 tonnes of natural uranium imported into France came mainly from three countries: Kazakhstan (27%), Niger (20%), and Uzbekistan (19%). Niger plays an important role in France's supplies, but its importance is overestimated by some politicians.On a global scale, however, ""Niger has become a secondary producer over the years, as production costs are high and prices slumped until 2016 after [the nuclear accident at] Fukushima,"" explained Teva Meyer, a lecturer at the University of Haute-Alsace and researcher at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs, to French newspaper Les Echos. By 2022, Niger accounted for just 4% of global production, well behind Kazakhstan (43%), Canada (15%), Namibia (11%), and Australia (8%).",/en/les-decodeurs/
"Women's World Cup: Despite rising prize money, female players still paid four times less than men","    FIFA has significantly increased the bonuses paid to female players for taking part in the World Cup in 2023, which they say will have an 'impact' on the lives and careers of the female players. ","The Women's World Cup, which has been taking place between Australia and New Zealand since July 20, is not only breaking attendance records. Bonuses paid to female players have also risen significantly – although the sums remain well below those of their male counterparts.The budget released by FIFA for players' bonuses increases with each World Cup. After doubling for the 2019 edition in France, it has tripled for 2023, rising to €100 million. That's 17 times more than for the 2007 edition.The remuneration is distributed among the players according to their team's performance in the tournament:However, the increase in bonuses for female players should be put into perspective in relation to the prize money paid to male players, which remains four times higher (€402 million in 2022), and continues to grow with each edition. Enough to cast doubt on the realism of the ""ultimate aim"" set in March by Gianni Infantino, to achieve ""equal pay at the men's and women's World Cups."" While the FIFA president claims to be proactive on the issue of bonuses, he also points to the responsibility of European broadcasters, who ""make offers 20 to 100 times inferior"" for the women's World Cup, even though its audiences represent ""around 50% to 60% of those of the men's World Cup.""This issue is all the more crucial for female players since the weight of bonuses in their salaries is much greater than for male internationals, who are generally better paid at their clubs. With the average salary of female professional footballers standing at around $14,000 (€12,725) a year, the amounts allocated for the 2023 World Cup will have ""a real and significant impact on the lives and careers of these players,"" said Infantino.The bonus paid to players on the winning team would thus represent almost twenty times the average annual income. By way of comparison, the finalist bonus of €290,000 paid to each player on the French team after their second-place finish in Qatar in 2022 represented less than 30% of midfielder Youssouf Fofana's annual income. And barely 0.4% of striker Kylian Mbappé's salary, estimated at €72 million.",/en/les-decodeurs/

A total of 59 survivors were rescued, according to French authorities, who reported an unconsolidated death toll on Sunday.The number of crossings has increased in recent days. On Saturday alone, 509 migrants were detected crossing to the English coast in 10 makeshift boats (or ""small boats""), according to the British Home Office. There were 756 on the previous Thursday, the highest daily tally since the start of the year. The authorities' count includes only those apprehended on arrival on British shores.In 2022, a record year, 45,000 people attempted the crossing, despite the perils of the Strait of Dover. The highest single-day number was reached on August 22, with 1,295 migrants apprehended aboard 27 boats. Peaks generally correspond to periods with optimal weather conditions, but crossings are attempted all year round, including during the coldest months.In 2022, five migrants died at sea and four were reported missing while attempting to reach the British coast from the northern coast of France. In November 2021, 27 migrants perished when their boat capsized.",/en/les-decodeurs/
"Canada's mega-fires: 13.7 million hectares of forest have burned, twice as much as the 1989 record",News,"On Thursday, August 17, the 20,000 residents of Yellowknife (Northwest Territories) were ordered to evacuate the city due to the rapid advance of forest fires. The early onset and extent of Canada's wildfires, which began in the spring, have already forced 168,000 people to evacuate since the start of the season – and there are still 230 active fires in the country today.With nearly 13.7 million hectares of forest affected as of August 16, 2023 (136.781 km2, the size of a country like Greece), Canada is facing its worst year for forest fires. Nearly twice as much area has burned as the previous ""record"" of 7.3 million hectares, reached in 1989, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).Canada, which because of its geographical location is warming faster than the rest of the planet, has been confronted in recent years with extremely violent weather events.",/en/les-decodeurs/
"What is the abaya, the garment France wants to ban from schools?",    France's education minister is seeking to ban the traditional over-garment on the grounds that it is an ostensibly religious symbol. ,"""I have decided that it is no longer permissible to wear the abaya to school,"" Minister of National Education and Youth Gabriel Attal announced on French television channel TF1 on Sunday, August 27. ""When you enter a classroom, you must not be able to identify the students' religion by looking at them."" ""Wherever the Republic is tested, we must stand together,"" the national education minister had already told education officers firmly in his meeting with them on Thursday.An abaya (Arabic for ""toga"" or ""cloak"") is an over-garment, often loose and light, worn from the shoulders to the feet. It is similar to the djellaba worn in North Africa or the qamis worn in West Africa. Although it is a women's garment, it can also be worn by men, albeit with a different cut. Though largely neutral in color, the abaya has also developed into fashion apparel with brighter hues.The djellaba, of Berber origin, is distinguished by its usually brighter colors and more elaborate ornamental motifs. The qamis, often considered the male equivalent of the abaya, has straighter lines.On the social network X (formerly Twitter), former Minister for Equality of Territories and Housing Cécile Duflot asked her followers whether a long covering dress of which she posted a photo was an ""attack on secularism."" It was in fact a ""2,980 Gucci dress,"" Duflot later specified after someone mistook the luxury dress for an abaya, thus proving her point that it can be hard to tell the difference between a long-covering dress and an abaya.According to a government memo seen by Le Monde, reports of breaches of secularism in schools have been on the rise over the past year (4,710 in 2022-2023, compared with 2,167 the previous year), and over 40% of monthly reports now concern clothing that may be both cultural and religious – such as the qamis or djellaba for men, or the abaya for women. These reports concern around 150 schools, out of several thousand primary and secondary schools.Some see this as a breach of the 2004 law, which prohibits ""the wearing of signs or clothing by which pupils ostensibly express a religious affiliation."" The previous education minister, Pap Ndiaye, had issued a directive in November 2022, leaving it up to individual school principals to decide whether or not such dress was religious. This stance was deemed too moderate, indeed lax, by the right-wing and far-right opposition.This is one of the main questions facing national education staff. The abaya is first and foremost a traditional garment. In his Detailed Lexicon Of Clothing Names Among Arabs (1845), the Dutch orientalist Reinhart Dozy defined it as ""the characteristic garment of the Bedouin at nearly all times."" Simple and rustic, it spread throughout the Persian Gulf and surrounding areas.Until the late 1970s, short and even colorful abayas were accepted in Saudi Arabia. Following a hostage-taking incident by fundamentalist rebels in Mecca in 1979, King Khal Aziz Al Saud made a number of pledges to the supporters of one of the most literalist and strict visions of Islam. Among the landmark laws was the compulsory wearing of the black abaya by women, who also lost many of their freedoms. The garment became a fixture in Saudi Arabia and a hallmark of Salafist Islam in the Western imagination.Seen from France, where the Wahhabi trend gained influence in the 2010s, the abaya can appear as a sign of religious affiliation. This interpretation has been disputed by the French Muslim Council, which, through vice president Abdallah Zekri, has simply described as ""a kind of fashion.""As things stand, school principals' assessment of the religious nature of the abaya depends above all on the context and the intention of the wearer. The handbook on secularism in schools, published in 2021 by the French Ministry of Education, specifies that ""a sign or outfit that is not, strictly speaking, religious, may thus be prohibited if it is worn to ostensibly manifest a religious affiliation."" A piece of clothing or a garment is considered to show signs of religious value if it is provocative, worn repeatedly, or a student refuses to remove it.France is the first Western country to announce its intention to ban the abaya from schools. But the first country to actually do so was Saudi Arabia, which, under the impetus of Crown Prince Mohammed Ben Salman, has undertaken a liberal turn in recent years. Since 2022, the Wahhabi kingdom has outlawed the wearing of abaya for women during examinations. This is one of a number of measures aimed at modernizing society in the oil-rich monarchy, such as the lifting of the driving ban for Saudi women.",/en/les-decodeurs/
"As Macron claims to fight plastic waste, the Elysée stocks up on disposable items","    The French presidency has signed a contract with kitchen item suppliers that runs until the end of Emmanuel Macron's second term. As many as 800,000 disposable plastic items could be used over four years. ","One hundred and thirty thousand cooking trays, 5,000 rolls of cling film, 72,000 vacuum cooking bags, 7,000 freezer pouches: A wave of plastic is sweeping through the Elysée Palace's kitchens. In March, the French presidency signed a contract with three suppliers to source ""disposable kitchen items"" until the end of the presidential term, in 2027. The deal runs counter to the public statements made by President Emmanuel Macron, who on May 29 denounced the ""scourge"" of plastic pollution, a ""time bomb"" that needs to be defused ""as quickly as possible"" in order to ""save our planet.""This contract will enable the Elysée to supply its restaurants and daycare with disposable kitchen items according to its needs over the period 2023-2027, for a maximum amount of €432,000. When contacted, the president's office stated that ""most"" of the products concerned were made of paper or cardboard. It claimed the presence of plastic is ""marginal"" and limited to items subject to ""hygiene"" standards, such as cling film or pastry bags.And yet, according to the contractual documents shared with Le Monde by the Elysée, 17 of the 30 product references in the specifications contain plastic: sauce pots, shoulder bags, cart protection covers, garbage can liners, cooking trays, storage bins... According to our estimates, over 800,000 disposable plastic kitchen items could be delivered over four years, even though alternative solutions in glass, fabric, metal or cane pulp exist on the market for each of these products. ""If the average consumer is able to have access to alternative solutions, I don't see why the Elysée wouldn't be able to,"" said Nathalie Gontard, a researcher at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE) and a specialist in plastic pollution.""The launch of the call for tenders followed a study of the various options and a transformation of working methods to align with the objectives of exemplarity in terms of waste and the use of plastic,"" said the Elysée's press office. Juliette Franquet, the director of the anti-waste NGO Zero Waste France, argued that ""the way the call for tenders was drafted does not call into question the use of plastic and disposables.""In fact, from the outset, the specifications imposed the supply of disposable items, closing the door to re-use solutions such as glass trays or reusable cling film. The environmental criterion, which counted for only 15% in the evaluation of candidates for the contract, focused above all on the quality of the vehicle fleet used for deliveries, without dwelling on the products themselves. ""There's not a single mention in the tender of the plastic reduction issue,"" said Gontard. ""It's a missed opportunity, because this type of large public contract could encourage players who propose alternative solutions, in order to help the industry develop,"" added Franquet.",/en/les-decodeurs/
"France's century-long crusade against religious symbols at school, from the crucifix to the abaya","    Since the secular school system was introduced in the late 19th century, there have been several laws on religious symbols at school. In the past the focus was on Christian symbols, whereas today the controversy is centered on clothing associated with Islam. ","It's déjà vu. First it was schoolgirls wearing headscarves, then mothers wearing headscarves, and now it's men and women wearing either the abaya or the khamis, two loose-fitting garments, that are in the firing line.Since an 1882 law introduced compulsory education, and one in 1905 separated Church and State, secularism in schools has been repeatedly put to the test − then reinforced by new bans and laws. While these rules were initially aimed at curbing the return of Catholic symbols to schools, for the past 30 years debates have almost exclusively centered on Islamic symbols in public spaces.In the inter-war period, France was split between defenders of republican schools and an opposition of royalist, nationalist and identitarian Catholic movements such as Action Française.Young people were also a part of the conflict, with several organizations trying to rally them to their cause. Young militants flaunted what side they were on by wearing stickers with slogans or images on them, which caused tension and brawls, even in schools. The minister of national education, Jean Zay, proclaimed that ""schools must remain the inviolable refuge where men's quarrels do not penetrate."" On December 31, 1936, Zay signed a notice banning political propaganda in schools.The Catholic far right defended France's Christian identity and called for the return of religious symbols to schools. On May 15, 1937, Zay added a short paragraph prohibiting ""religious propaganda"" to a second decree. It was a ""simple addendum, a sort of showing remorse toward secular groups,"" notes historian Olivier Loubes in the magazine Vingtième Siècle.The Vichy regime put an end to the Third Republic and its principles. Secularism was questioned. Crucifixes were reinstalled in several public places, including schools, provoking anger from schoolteachers, who launched the Resistance magazine L'Ecole Laïque in 1941.The reactions from the education authorities and in schools across the country were strong enough for Admiral Darlan, vice-president of the Collaborationist Council of Ministers, to concede in a circular dated April 15, 1941 that schools ""receive children of all faiths"" and cannot be placed ""under a religious symbol.""But in practice, this circular did not prevent crucifixes being put back in public schools. It was only after the Liberation that they were removed again, and in 1946, the Fourth Republic reaffirmed the secular nature of schools.Over the years, issues relating to secularism have shifted from Catholicism to Islam. By the end of the 1980s, the Islamic headscarf was being worn in over 150 establishments, according to a report cited by former interior minister Pierre Joxe on the TV program ""Complément d'enquête."" However, it did not receive much attention.The situation changed in autumn 1989, when three Muslim teenage girls aged 13 and 14 were expelled from the Gabriel-Havez secondary school in Creil, a suburb north of Paris, because they refused to remove their headscarves, which covered their hair and shoulders, in class. The school's principal, Ernest Chénière, believed that they were not complying with the 1937 circular and were endangering ""secular serenity.""The issue became political. The Socialist presidential majority, who had dismissed it as a mere news story, was taken by surprise by the intensity of public debate. Chénière, who maintained his firm stance in front of the cameras, was co-opted by the far right, although he tried to distance himself.After the then-minister of education Lionel Jospin took charge of the affair, the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest administrative court, handed down a nuanced decision on November 27, 1989: While outlawing religious signs of an ""ostentatious or assertive"" nature, it considered wearing a headscarf to not be incompatible with secularism, and left it to school principals to judge on a case-by-case basis.It took the involvement of the prime minister and the Moroccan consul to reach a compromise allowing the three girls to return to school wearing their headscarves, but taking it off in class.The issue resurfaced at the end of 2002 with the case of a high school student wearing a headscarf in Lyon. She was excluded from almost all of her classes, but not from the school, after the board of education intervened. The teachers, who felt deprived of their authority, went on strike. ""The law requires teachers to judge ostentatiousness for themselves. This prerogative is impossible,"" said the Syndicat National des Enseignements de Second Degré in left-leaning daily newspaper Libération.In February 2002, Rassemblement pour la République (center-right) MP Jacques Myard tabled a bill against the ""Islamic headscarf"" in schools, which he described as ""a symbol of sexual discrimination."" Unusually, the issue crossed traditional political divides: Part of the left was in favor, like former culture minister Jack Lang, while part of the right was opposed, like former president Nicolas Sarkozy.President Jacques Chirac installed a cross-party commission made up of politicians, thinkers and academics, and chaired by Médiateur de la République Bernard Stasi. In December, his report recommended both greater recognition of Islam, for example by including Eid al-Adha among public holidays, and a ban on ""dress and signs manifesting religious or political affiliation.""This report inspired the law of March 15, 2004, which stipulates that ""in public middle and highs schools, the wearing of symbols or clothes through which pupils clearly show a religious affiliation is prohibited."" While the law primarily targets the headscarf, it also bans Jewish yarmulkes, large Catholic crosses and Sikh turbans from schools.Put to rest for a few years, the controversy resurfaced in the 2010s. In 2011, the then-education minister Luc Chatel announced that the government wanted to ban mothers joining schoolchildren on field trips from wearing headscarves. A circular was published in 2012, but the Conseil d'Etat objected that, as neither ""public agents"" nor official ""workers"" with a public service, mothers helping out on school trips are not legally subject to the ""requirements of religious neutrality.""The subject resurfaced yet again in February 2019 when, in the name of the ""fight against communitarianism,"" the Les Républicains (right) MP for the Alpes-Maritimes department, Eric Ciotti, tried once again to legislate against mothers wearing headscarves on school trips. Despite the support of national education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, the idea was finally rejected by MPs.The controversy came back a few months later, after a far-right Rassemblement National politician verbally abused and even manhandled a school chaperone wearing a headscarf during a regional council meeting in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. It was an opportunity for France's right wing to take up their old refrain again: ""If the headscarf is banned in schools, it must also be banned from school trips,"" said the Les Républicans president, Christian Jacob.The right-wing Sénat majority was again trying to push through a ban on headscarves on school outings in the summer of 2021, via an amendment to the Anti-Separatism Bill, which attempted to extend the 2004 law to apply to ""all people participating in the public education service."" But the Assemblée Nationale once again rejected the proposal.The debate then refocused on students' clothing. In November 2022, a memo from the French ministry of education noted an increase in reports of the wearing of abayas, khamis and djellabas, three items of clothing common in Muslim countries.Then-education minister Pap Ndiaye published a memo calling for dialogue, and, in the event of failure, ""systematic and progressive"" sanctions. The right thought the text was too timid and difficult to apply, as it shifted the responsibility onto school principals.At the end of August 2023, his successor, Gabriel Attal, went further and announced his clear intention to ban the abaya and khamis in schools, applicable from the start of the new school year. In a memo, the ministry said that wearing these outfits ""clearly demonstrates a religious affiliation in a school environment"" and must lead to dialogue with the pupil, and, in the event of refusal, ""disciplinary procedure.""The left-wing opposition is divided between secularist and inclusive factions. Some, like the La France Insoumise MP Eric Coquerel, condemned it as a ""form of racism,"" as the religious connotation of these garments is disputed by the French Council of the Muslim Faith. The measure has also been deemed disproportionate and unenforceable, as abayas and khamis are difficult to distinguish from other long garments.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Schools torched in Belgium: New sex education program targeted by waves of misinformation,    The start of the Belgian school year has been marred by controversy surrounding a two-hour-a-year 'education in emotional and sexual relationships.' Ill-informed parents claim the goal is to hyper-sexualize children. ,"""Don't touch our children!"" These were the cries of 1,500 people who protested in the center of Brussels on Sunday, September 17, against a two-hour-a-year school-based ""education in relationships, affective and sexual life"" (EVRAS), promoted by the French-speaking Minister of Education Caroline Désir, aimed primarily at pre-teens and teenagers. The draft decree of the proposal was adopted on September 7.In Belgium, where love life education has been compulsory since July 2012, the program aims to promote ""respect for others"" and ""equality"" as well as ""prevent violence in love relationships;"" ""deconstruct sexist and homophobic stereotypes,"" ""prevent unplanned pregnancies"" and, finally, ""reduce sexually transmitted infections."" As Belgian daily Le Soir explains, this is a ""public health tool for schools.""However, the awareness-raising program is the subject of many misunderstandings, misinformation, and infamous conspiracy theories, particularly among Catholic and Muslim communities. They see it as a project for the sexualization of children, or even institutionalized pedophilia. As early as September 7, La Libre reported the circulation of a false e-mail distorting the aim of EVRAS' activities. Eight schools have since been set on fire or vandalized.Around September 8, the masked testimony of a man introducing himself as an outraged father took TikTok by storm. The man recounted a story allegedly told to him by his son – ""Teachers told him to touch [a] little girl's privates."" The claims are devoid of any context, making them impossible to verify. ""We have pedophiles in our schools,"" he said. According to his account, the school principal justified what happened by citing ""the law"" and ""new bills."" He concluded his video by explaining that he had sold his house and second car to move to Spain, because ""this only happens in France.""As many internet users have pointed out, the testimonial contains numerous inconsistencies and approximations, starting with the fact that the awareness-raising program concerns Belgium and not France, and that there is no question of performing any sexual gesture whatsoever: It's all about dialogue.Another viral video, among many others, made on September 9 by ""Nadou G the lioness"" with an openly conspiracy-minded profile, worried about ""free access to pedophilia in schools,"" and explained that ""they want to turn our kids trans."" In reality, the EVRAS guide only plans to combat transphobia by raising awareness on gender identity. ""We're obviously not going to encourage hyper-sexualization among young people, nor are we going to induce sexual orientation or gender identity,"" said the French-speaking education minister. His words are based on a 300-page informative guide and only certain points are brought up, depending on the class profile and students' questions.At the same time, several petitions have sprung up. The first, posted online on September 11 and signed by 13,000 people, calls for French Education Minister Gabriel Attal to ""react to his EVRAS law and withdraw it."" It is an incongruous project, to say the least. However, as Libération points out, it is not a law, and EVRAS doesn't concern France: Attal therefore has little to do with the issue.A second petition appeared around September 13 on the Les Lignes Bougent website. ""The S in EVRAS means that our children will be informed of the possibilities of individual and group SEX [and] MASTURBATION from the age of 5 in schools, and from the age of 9 informed and subjected to pornography. BY OUTSIDE CONTRIBUTORS this is very serious, we absolutely must act against it,"" it read. French rapper Rohff shared the petition with his 800,000 X (formerly Twitter) followers, inviting them to sign it to prevent ""your children, your 5-year-old nieces and nephews from being taught to masturbate and being taught about penetration and pornography at age 9."" In just a few days, 25,000 people, mainly mothers, signed the petition.The Belgian site RTL has shown that the rapper is misinformed: The two-hour school activity is not aimed at 5 and 9-year-olds but rather at 12 and 15-year-olds. The EVRAS guide only plans to tackle the issue of masturbation with 12-14-year-olds, not 5-year-olds. ""I've read that we're going to 'teach children to masturbate,' it's completely unacceptable to scare parents on this subject,"" said Désir, the Belgian minister.As for pornography, it is addressed with 9 to 11-year-olds because, according to a Luxembourg study, 19.4% of 10-11-year-olds have already looked at pornographic content on the internet at least once. The aim is not so much to introduce them to it, but to assess its ""positive and negative influence"" and ""develop [a] critical sense."" What's more, while the program will eventually include situations adapted to broader age groups, ""the activities are based on the pupils' own questions,"" specifies the official website. The aim is not to impose themes, but to respond to spontaneous questions from children and teenagers.The topic is being exploited by a network of activists. Some are opposed to EVRAS for political or religious reasons: conservatives who don't want certain progressive themes, such as sexual orientation or gender identity, to be addressed in schools. But others go beyond the simple framework of societal disagreement to spread an openly conspiratorial vision of the sex education guide, accusing it of serving pedophilic interests, a conspiracy core theme that has been revitalized in recent years by the QAnon network and the release of the film Sound of Freedom.An inquiry by national Belgian radio and television RTBF has uncovered a network of 25 people and identities ""active in disinformation around EVRAS,"" divided into five groups: followers of pedocriminal theories, child defenders, Covid skeptics, conspiracy-leaning media and fundamentalist religious groups. One of those, Civitas – which has been banned in France – present at the anti-EVRAS protest in Brussels on September 17, were fantasizing about ""the application of a global plan promoted by the WHO to install a 'new sexual world order.'""While it's rare for it to gain this much traction, false information about sex education courses is not uncommon. In 2018, an alarmist publication assured that a national education circular in France planned to address sexual issues with 5-year-olds. In reality, it was a Swiss report on child sexuality.Similarly, the August 3, 2018, law which introduced the presumption of non-consent for sexual relations with minors under the age of 15, was accused – against all evidence – of ""legalizing pedophilia.""A school circular extending sex education lessons to include the notion of consent had also been described by far-right websites as ""sextracurricular"" time serving the interests of pedophiles.",/en/les-decodeurs/

The EU fight against child pornography stokes fears of widespread online surveillance,Investigation,"""The privacy advocates sound very loud. But someone must also speak for the children."" Just a few months before launching her initiative against online child pornography, in November 2021, Ylva Johansson had already prepared the debate over what would become one of the most contentious legislative proposals Brussels had seen in years. Did the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs sense that this apparently universally agreeable policy would provoke such heavy backlash from among civil society and across the political spectrum?The Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (CSAR) plans to introduce a complex technical architecture called client-side scanning to combat the proliferation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).This approach relies on artificial intelligence systems for detecting images, videos and speech containing sexual abuse against minors, and attempts at grooming kids. It would require all digital platforms at risk of being used for malicious purposes – from Facebook to Telegram, Signal to Snapchat or TikTok, to data clouds and online gaming websites – to use this technology to detect and report traces of CSAM on their systems and users’ private chats. This is impossible without weakening end-to-end encryption, currently the ultimate way to secure digital communications.Technology specialists and online rights groups were quick to warn that, behind a veil of good intentions (equipping the authorities to effectively combat the proliferation of CSAM), this ""chat control"" could lead to the disproportionate infringement of fundamental rights and online privacy for all EU citizens. This has fed an important opposition movement among EU legislators, both in the Parliament – where the text will pass a key test during a vote at the Civil Liberties Committee in October – and in the Council – where discussions are stalling due to opposition from a few key Member States.Johansson, though, has not blinked once, dubbing the project as her ""number one priority"". The Commissioner can boast the support of numerous child protection organisations loudly urging for the adoption of the text.Far from a spontaneous movement, the campaign in favour of CSAR has been largely orchestrated and bankrolled by a network of entities with ties to the tech industry and security services, whose interests go far beyond child protection. Amidst the Commission’s efforts to keep a tight lid on details of the campaign, our investigation – based on dozens of interviews, leaks of internal records and documents obtained through freedom of information laws – has uncovered a coordinated communication effort between Johansson’s cabinet and these lobby groups. Johansson has not responded to several requests for an interview.",/en/les-decodeurs/
A European tax on the super-rich could bring in over €200 billion a year,    A study commissioned by the Greens in the European Parliament assessed for the first time the potential revenue of a tax on the richest 0.5%. ,"Nothing beats a well-documented and well-timed report. Two weeks after the launch of a broad appeal by economists and politicians to tax extreme wealth in the name of tax justice at the G20 summit in New Delhi – co-signed by 139 American and British millionaires ready to contribute without delay – the Greens/European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament published a study on Wednesday, September 20, urging a move ""from slogan to reality.""""Spain took the lead in Europe and introduced a temporary and progressive tax on wealth. But what if all EU countries were to introduce that same tax?"" the Greens ask in the introduction to their report, referring to the ""solidarity tax"" introduced by Pedro Sanchez's Socialist government in early 2023, for a two-year period.This study, carried out by the NGO Tax Justice Network using data on income, wealth and inequality, OECD statistics and the work of economists such as Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez, assessed ""the potential of implementing a wealth tax and ending tax abuse of the super-rich."" It delivered hard-hitting figures: A ""moderate progressive"" wealth tax, centered on the richest 0.5% of each European state, would bring in over €213 billion in additional tax revenue to public coffers every year. This ""top 0.5%"" alone holds almost 20% of Europe's wealth, compared with 3.5% for the least wealthy half of the population, the Greens pointed out. Furthermore, their wealth has increased by 35% in the last 10 years.Germany and France, in particular, would reap substantial benefits from implementing a tax targeting the wealthiest individuals, with projected gains of €65.1 billion and €46.1 billion, respectively. But so too would the whole of Southern Europe, including Italy (with €27.2 billion), Portugal (€3.7 billion) and Greece (€1.4 billion). Unlike the tax passed in Spain or the French real estate wealth tax, the tax proposed by the Greens would apply to all assets (real estate, bank deposits, company shares, works of art, and so on).Unprecedented on a European scale, the calculation is a real eye-opener. These tax revenues would represent 1.35% of the combined GDP of the EU-27, which doesn't even take into account possible advancements in addressing tax avoidance by the wealthiest individuals in tax havens – a cause that the Greens are advocating for an increased focus on. It represents a sum equivalent to a check for €1,083 per European household, which would represent the promise of a significant redistribution of national wealth.",/en/les-decodeurs/
How European banks help oil and gas giants acquire billions,Investigation,"In a brief financial press release sent out on April 26, Var Energi was ""pleased to announce"" that it had raised €600 million to finance its activities. What the Norwegian oil and gas company didn't specify was the assistance of several guardian angels, notably including four French banking groups: Crédit Agricole, Société Générale and Natixis, which co-organized the transaction, as well as BNP Paribas, which played an administrative role.Working with Var Energi, a company whose business is 100% focused on fossil fuels that emit high levels of greenhouse gases, does seem to contradict these banks' commitments to help meet the targets set out in the Paris Agreement. However, this collaboration is authorized under their climate commitment charters, since it takes the form of issuing financial bonds: The banks are not lending their money directly but rather assisting the energy company at multiple levels to borrow from private investors. This is known as indirect financing.Le Monde collaborated with a dozen European media outlets, including Investico, Follow the Money, and The Guardian to lift the secrecy surrounding this little-known aspect of fossil fuel financing. The conclusion of our investigation, dubbed ""Fossil Finance,"" is clear: When a gas or oil giant raises hundreds of millions of euros via financial bonds, European banks are almost always on board.In December 2015, the Paris Agreement formalized the urgent need to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Financing for fossil fuels, however, has not dried up since then. Between January 2016 and June 2023, no less than €1.011 trillion were raised by 307 major polluters to continue the expansion of their fossil fuel activities, all thanks to the issuance of 1,666 ""gray"" bonds. This source of funds represents some 20 to 40% of the sector's financing, with the rest being through direct loans.While it's common to blame Asian and American banks for financing fossil fuels, European institutions are at the heart of this market: €776 billion, or 77% of the total, were financed with the assistance of at least one of them, almost as much as their American counterparts (€801 billion). French institutions (Crédit Agricole, BNP Paribas, Société Générale, and – to a lesser extent – Natixis) are among the most active in Europe in this respect: They are involved in just over half of all transactions (52%).Saudi Aramco, ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, TotalEnergies... the list of the world's most heavily financed companies more or less coincides with that of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. And French institutions are no more selective than others.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Police search French MP’s office on suspicion of influence peddling,"    French courts are looking into why, at the Assemblée Nationale, Hubert Julien-Laferrière promoted an African cryptocurrency that is suspected of being a scam. ","A number of simultaneous searches were carried out by French police on Wednesday, September 27, as part of an investigation into suspected foreign interference in French media and politics. They followed revelations about the disinformation industry published in February by Forbidden Stories, Le Monde and some 15 other international media as part of the Story Killers project, which led to the opening of an investigation by the National Financial Prosecutor's Office for influence peddling, bribery of public officials and private corruption.The Normandy home of Jean-Pierre Duthion, the lobbyist implicated in the affair, was searched by police, according to Le Monde, confirming a report by Politico. Duthion was suspected of having been an essential cog in a number of different influence campaigns, on behalf of clients in Morocco, Bahrain and Qatar. In particular, he was suspected of having provided ""verbal elements"" and even ready-made ""subjects"" to journalists, including former BFM-TV presenter Rachid M'Barki, as well as to elected representatives, including MP Hubert Julien-Laferrière (Europe Écologie-Les Verts, EELV).The MP's office and his home were also searched on Wednesday. Mediapart had revealed that Julien-Laferrière had promoted a cryptocurrency called Limocoin during a committee hearing at the Assemblée Nationale. Launched by a Cameroonian businessman accused of fraud, this dubious and relatively confidential cryptocurrency has lost 85% of its value in the space of a year. In particular, the police are seeking to establish whether Julien-Laferrière, who was in contact with Duthion, may have received any quid pro quo in exchange for this plea, or whether it was, as the MP claims, all ""bullshit."" None of the individuals involved have so far been taken into custody, according to Le Monde's information.In February, Duthion was thrust into the spotlight after the discovery of a number of different segments were broadcast on the BFM-TV nightly news. These subjects presented by M'Barki, who was dismissed by the channel after an internal investigation, included a short report on European sanctions in the yachting sector, a piece on a summit in Western Sahara and various segments devoted to a Qatari personality who was the subject of a smear campaign on French soil orchestrated from Bahrain.The two common elements to these and other segments were not only Duthion, suspected of having played the role of intermediary in influence campaigns, but also Team Jorge, an Israeli company offering to set up disinformation campaigns from scratch, for profit or political purposes, for clients, businessmen or government officials. During a meeting with journalists from the Forbidden Stories consortium, who had posed as potential clients, the head of the company had presented images of a subject by M'Barki, claiming that he was behind their broadcast.",/en/les-decodeurs/

Citizenship for sale: Dominica's golden passports go haywire,Investigation,"The small town of Atherton, in California's San Francisco Bay, was popular with top athletes, Silicon Valley billionaires and prominent politicians. What's more surprising was that, given her salary as an immigration lawyer, Danhong ""Jean"" Chen was able to afford a dream villa with her husband costing nearly $6 million in 2013. The little local mystery was finally dispelled following a lengthy investigation by the SEC, the US financial markets watchdog, which unraveled the gigantic scam set up by the couple to amass at least $12 million (€11.5 million) by embezzling money from foreign investors seeking residency in the United States, over the course of almost a decade.The day after her indictment on October 18, 2018, Chen managed to leave the US using an assumed name, Maria Sofia Taylor, with her Dominican passport. The lawyer, however, has no ties with Dominica, a small Caribbean sliver between Guadeloupe and Martinique. To escape American justice, she had secretly purchased this second citizenship a few weeks earlier, as part of a passport of convenience program set up by the island. And she's far from an isolated case.Thousands of people have acquired Dominican nationality in this way, taking advantage of the ""citizenship by investment"" (CBI) program. This system, set up by the government in 1993, enables any foreign national to acquire a passport in less than three months, on the sole condition of paying $100,000 or investing twice that amount in the local economy, without even setting foot on the island.For the first time, a joint investigation by Le Monde, the OCCRP consortium, the American NGO Government Accountability Project and a dozen media partners has shed light on the excesses of this passport of convenience program. For over a year, the journalists scrutinized a list of 7,700 recent possessors of Dominican passports, compiled from public sources and court documents.Among these thousands of new Dominicans – including entire families from China, Russia and the Middle East – are a litany of criminals and embezzlers of all kinds: Taiwanese fraudsters, Azeri oligarchs, a former Afghan minister accused of war crimes and torture, a high-ranking officer from Kaddhafi's Libya, former spies, financial fraudsters, Russian billionaires under sanctions and arms dealers. The list also includes many high-ranking public officials: two central bank governors and a former head of Saddam Hussein's nuclear program rub shoulders with Samir Rifai, the former Jordanian Prime Minister (2009-2011), who declared a few years ago that he did not ""approve, from a personal point of view and in general, for a Jordanian to have another nationality.""",/en/les-decodeurs/
How the French Navy tried to interfere in the 2021 Channel migrant shipwreck,"    Phone taps show that the French Armed Forces Ministry leaked information to servicemen indicted following the death of 27 people in November 2021, and coached them in how to respond. ","""Honestly, those two guys... I wish they were dead."" On May 31, 2023, Marc Bonnafous confided in a close friend. An investigation has been underway for a year and a half into the sinking of a migrant boat in the Channel in November 2021. Although he had not been director of the Centre Régional Opérationnel de Surveillance et de Sauvetage (Regional Surveillance and Rescue Operations Centre, known as CROSS) in Gris-Nez, northern France, for several months, Bonnafous was concerned about developments in this case, which threatened maritime rescue services.A week earlier, nine of his former subordinates were taken into police custody on suspicion of failing to assist a person in danger. In the days following the tragedy, which claimed the lives of at least 27 people, the two survivors – the ""two guys"" referred to by Bonnafous – told the press they had repeatedly called French and UK rescue services to report that their boat was sinking, to no avail. ""When I saw that the two survivors were starting to tell the police that there had been issues during the [rescue] operation, I thought, whoa, this stinks,"" he told his friend over the phone – unaware that investigators were listening in.In total, around 10 people working at CROSS or on the patrol boat Flamant, which was out at sea on the night of the sinking, have been wire-tapped. The content of the recordings, which Le Monde has accessed, reveals the extent to which the controversy is embarrassing the military leadreship, and the maneuvers taken by the French Navy to keep a close watch on developments in the investigation. The navy's aim is to prepare those implicated, even if it means sidestepping the confidentiality of the investigation.According to Le Monde's information, confirmed by the Paris public prosecutor's office, an investigation into breaches of confidentiality has been opened, following a tip-off from the investigating judges in this case and a complaint lodged by the civil parties.These suspicions of a breach of secrecy focus on a short period in the spring of 2023, a few days before the CROSS and Flamant personnel were taken into custody, at the end of which seven were indicted for failure to assist a person in danger – a period of considerable tension for the navy.On May 11, 2023,  the crew of the Flamant did not yet know that they would be summoned by investigators from the Gendarmerie Maritime's research section in Cherbourg, northwestern France, at the end of the month. However, the French Navy had already been informed and decided to warn its servicemen. The message was delivered by a senior officer, Vice Admiral François-Xavier Blin, then Inspector of the French Navy. ""Eight members of your crew (...) will be summoned. Now normally the date is not supposed to be known,"" Vice Admiral Blin confided to Audrey M, the commanding officer of the Flamant.",/en/les-decodeurs/
How French group Technip Energies participated in a Russian gas megaproject despite international sanctions,Investigation,"It was a chilling letter that heralded some difficult months to come. On April 18, 2022, Oleg Karpushin, head of the Russian gas project Arctic LNG 2, wrote to remind his contractor Technip Energies of its obligations. A French specialist in gas engineering, Technip Energies was caught in the crossfire. On the one hand, new European sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine were forcing it to suspend its participation in the construction of this huge natural gas liquefaction plant in western Siberia. On the other, the company's client was insisting that it fulfill all its contractual commitments.Technip Energies had a big stake in this project: The contract it won to oversee the engineering and construction of the project, in Russia and China, was worth over €7 billion. Exiting without the approval of its Russian client could expose the company to heavy losses and penalties, despite having already put in millions of work hours.Seen from the outside, the French group seems to have managed the miracle of getting out of this rough patch without too much damage. On July 27, 2023, it announced the ""finalization"" of its exit from Arctic LNG 2, while ""strictly"" respecting the law ""throughout the project,"" it told Le Monde.However, our investigation reveals that Technip Energies not only prepared for its departure but also facilitated the continuation of the project, while the United States and Europe sought on the contrary to hinder it. Customs data, satellite images, internal documents and testimonies suggest that the French group and several other Western companies may have circumvented international sanctions during these 15 months.Vladimir Putin's visit to the construction site on July 20, 2023 bears witness to the fact that Arctic LNG 2 is a strategic project for Moscow. Following the successful commissioning of Yamal in 2017, this new gas liquefaction mega-plant is set to boost the country's liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity by 60% by 2026. This goal is not without its environmental critics: Helping to produce ever more gas is difficult to reconcile with the fight against climate change.Its architecture is a feat of engineering for the region: In the Arctic, temperatures can reach -50°C. Most of the plant's components, weighing several thousand tonnes, were manufactured in China before being shipped by sea to Murmansk, Russia. It is here, 1,500 kilometers north of Moscow, that the parts are assembled by Technip Energies and its partners to build the three liquefaction trains, gigantic floating gas production structures 60 meters high. Each occupies an area the size of six football pitches. They are then towed to their final destination, the Gydan Peninsula, close to the gas fields.",/en/les-decodeurs/
"Arras terror attack: Why wasn't the suspect, who was under surveillance, deported?","    Political leaders criticized the fact that the attacker of a French teacher had remained in France in 2014, while his family was the target of deportation proceedings. ","Was there a systemic error? That's what the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) has argued since the terrorist knife attack that claimed the life of a French teacher, Dominique Bernard, on Friday October 13. The alleged perpetrator, Mohammed Mogouchkov, is a Russian Muslim extremist who, in 2014, had almost been sent back to Russia. Jordan Bardella (RN) denounced ""flaws in the entire chain of responsibility,"" when the current government and officials from the 2014 French government have insisted that the law has been respected.There are numerous exceptions to the French law on foreign nationals, which benefited the assailant, whose record was clean and whose surveillance had been unable to prove any terrorist intentions.In 2008, Mogouchkov's family, originally from Ingushetia (a region in south-west Russia where Sunni Islam predominates), moved to France, to the village of La Guerche-de-Bretagne, south of Rennes, Britanny. He was 6 years old at the time. His father tried everything to gain refugee status, but to no avail.In 2013, his final application for residency was rejected by the prefecture. The couple and their five children, including a baby, were then placed under house arrest in a shelter. On February 18, 2014, border police arrested the family and transferred them to Charles de Gaulle airport to be sent back to Russia. But their expulsion was canceled at the last minute.At the time, the local press emphasized the efforts of associations supporting undocumented migrants. The decision was nevertheless taken by then-interior minister Manuel Valls' staff as he explained on Franceinfo public radio on October 15. His team ""considered that the family, who had been there for more than five years, who had children in school from [early primary to middle school], met the criteria of what was called the Valls circular concerning undocumented migrants, the expulsion of children."" This 2012 circular indeed provides for several situations in which it is suggested that the prefect show flexibility when faced with a request for regularization from an undocumented foreigner:It was on the basis of this last criterion that the Mogouchkov family's deportation procedure was canceled. This required proof of ""long-term settlement"" of at least five years, barring exceptions, and that at least one of the children had been attending school ""for at least three years"" – conditions which the family met, the associations had argued, even though the prefecture had contested their school attendance record.Mogouchkov turned 18 in 2021. However, article L631-3 of the Code of Entry and Residence of Foreigners and of the Right to Asylum (Ceseda) prohibits the deportation of a person who has settled in France before the age of 13, which was the case for Mogouchkov. Nevertheless, the law provides for exceptions, notably ""behavior likely to jeopardize the fundamental interests of the state, or linked to activities of a terrorist nature."" This is why former president François Hollande estimated, on October 16, that he ""could have been expelled.""But these behaviors still need to be proven. In 2019, the suspected terrorist's brother, Movsar, was arrested by the General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) on suspicion of disseminating jihadist propaganda for the Islamic State organization. In April 2023, he was sentenced to five years of unsuspended imprisonment.Mogouchkov, meanwhile, was flagged by his high school for radicalization in 2020. Since 2023, he has been on the ""S"" watch list – the S standing for ""security"". French intelligence services were monitoring him for alleged links with activities threatening state security – in this case, Islamist terrorism – a type of watchlisting that is not based on a judicial decision, and is sometimes based on indirect evidence, such as acquaintance with a terrorist.On October 16, Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin told a press conference that the assailant's criminal record was clean, that he had been monitored by the DGSI for less than three months, and that no evidence of a terrorist plot had been found.  According to the interior ministry, French intelligence services were taken by surprise by ""his sudden decision to act"".After the attack, Darmanin has announced his intention to step up deportations to Russia. ""There are around sixty people on the ""S"" watch list of Russian nationality,"" he said on October 14. ""Among them, there are obviously people from Chechnya. The instruction we had, until now, was the systematic expulsion of those people who can be particularly dangerous."" The minister has advocated for a ""systematic expulsion"" of people identified as dangerous.But French law prohibits the return of an individual to their country of origin if it can be determined ""that their life or freedom is threatened there."" Similarly, European law forbids deportations to countries that practice torture on political opponents or religious minorities.Darmanin said he would not take these legal considerations into account, assuring listeners that sometimes ""it's better to be condemned by the [European Convention on Human Rights] and protect the French"". But it is still necessary for the country of origin to accept the return of these people.In fact, to deport an undocumented immigrant from France who does not have a valid passport from his or her country of origin, it is necessary to obtain a ""consular laissez-passer"" (an exceptional travel permit), allowing the person to travel. But as the interior minister noted, ""diplomatic relations (...) between Russia and France are extremely limited, not to say non-existent"".Finally, even with an agreement between Russia and France for the return of a Russian national, a final obstacle remains. The absence of a direct flight between the two countries makes deportation virtually impossible; the authorities would have to obtain transit visas through third countries for the deportee, as well as for his or her escort.On October 11, the Paris Court of Appeal had to set a Russian national free, as the administration responsible for providing a flight had been unable to find a solution for reaching Russia, even with a layover.",/en/les-decodeurs/

'Carbon bombs': Why climate preservation relies on halting all fossil fuel expansion projects,"    Existing infrastructure far exceeds the carbon budget required to stay below 1.5°C. The continued expansion of oil, gas and coal is incompatible with compliance with the Paris Agreement. ","Antonio Guterres is continuing to warn of the devastating effects of climate disruption. In June 2023, the secretary general of the United Nations (UN) once again called on world leaders to take action. Tackling climate change ""must start with the polluted heart of the climate crisis: the fossil fuel industry,"" he said, with a very clear message: ""Financial institutions everywhere must end lending, underwriting and investments in coal anywhere – including new coal infrastructure, power plants and mines.""From a climate point of view, Guterres's call for an immediate end to fossil fuel expansion is based on mathematical reasoning. To keep global warming below 1.5°C by the end of the century compared with the pre-industrial era (the most ambitious objective of the Paris Agreement), the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere must not exceed a certain threshold. As emissions continue to rise, the carbon budget, in other words, the cumulative emissions that can still be released – a kind of small cake that has to be shared by mankind – is becoming ever smaller.According to the latest synthesis report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the carbon budget for a 50/50 chance of staying below 1.5°C is half a trillion tonnes of CO2, equivalent to just 12 years of emissions at current rates. For 2°C, it would be 1.15 trillion tonnes, or 28 years of emissions.However, IPCC scientists have shown that CO2 emissions from existing fossil infrastructures, if operating as planned, far exceed the carbon budget for staying below 1.5°C, and are roughly equivalent to the budget for 2°C. This finding suggests that further oil and gas expansion is incompatible with compliance with the Paris Agreement. ""Continued installation of unabated fossil fuel infrastructure will 'lock-in' GHG emissions,"" the IPCC said.In theory, it might be possible to invest in new fossil fuel-fired infrastructure if, at the same time, existing facilities were shut down. In reality, however, this hypothesis is hardly credible. ""It's much easier not to open a new facility than to close an existing field,"" said Olivier Bois von Kursk, policy advisor at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, an independent think tank that has analyzed around 100 transition scenarios. ""Once capital has been invested in a project, companies will do everything to exploit it to the end. Workers' unions can also oppose a closure.""While the work of the IPCC shows why continued oil and gas expansion is not sufficient to meet climate commitments, it was the International Energy Agency (IEA) that forced this observation into the public debate and turned it into a policy recommendation. In May 2021, the organization stated for the first time that no investment in new oil or gas facilities, nor in new coal-fired power plants without carbon capture or storage solutions, should be made.",/en/les-decodeurs/
'Carbon bombs': Explore the map of the world's biggest fossil fuel expansion projects,In Graphs,"Located in every corner of the globe, ""carbon bombs"" are the fossil fuel extraction projects with the greatest potential for the last CO2 emissions, due to the scale of their known oil, gas and coal reserves. Le Monde invites you to explore these megafields in this map built from data collected for CarbonBombs.org and released on Tuesday, October 31, by the NGOs Data for Good and Eclaircies.The CarbonBombs.org project aims to catalogue as much information as possible on the hydrocarbon extraction sites with the greatest potential for CO2 emissions worldwide. It was born of the realization that ""there is very little reliable public data to identify fossil fuel projects worldwide, their total reserves, associated greenhouse gas emissions and the players involved,"" explained Oriane Wegner and Lou Welgryn. The co-founders of Eclaircies believe that this  is a sign of a ""lack of transparency and public information on this subject, which is essential in the fight against global warming.""To remedy this shortcoming, the two French NGOs cross-referenced three public databases and ""forged new links to reveal the connections between these carbon bombs, the companies involved and the banks that finance them.""At the heart of this survey is a list of 425 fossil fuel deposits drawn up by a group of researchers in an article published in 2022 in the journal Energy Policy, which popularized the concept of the carbon bomb. The study, led by Germany's Kjell Kühne, a doctor at Leeds University (UK) and director of the Leave it in the Ground NGO, focuses only on sites with available reserves likely to emit at least one billion tons (one gigaton) of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) before running out. This purely symbolic threshold is intended to draw public attention to the highest-emitting sites – but leaves out thousands of other fossil fuel deposits with slightly lower reserves.The list is a mixture of deposits currently being exploited (294) and extraction projects due to come on stream in the near future (128). Three carbon bombs have been halted since the article was published and are not shown on our map, which is also missing several projects announced over the past year or overlooked by the researchers in their initial review. As some sites could not be precisely located, they appear in the center of the country in which they are located.The approximate emissions potential of each site should be taken with caution. To calculate it, Kühne and his team used industry-recognized conversion factors, enabling a quantity of oil, gas or coal extracted to be converted into the quantity of CO2e emitted during end use. In the absence of open data on the reserves present in the deposits, the researchers relied on the reference database maintained by the extremely expensive private firm Rystad Energy, to which they were given access free of charge.As part of CarbonBombs.org, the nonprofits Data for Good and Eclaircies set out to link each of these extraction sites to the companies that operate or own them. In the absence of transparent financial information made available by the fossil fuel sector, volunteers relied on the Global Energy Monitor Wiki, an open-source encyclopedia of fossil fuel projects maintained by an American NGO. Although very comprehensive, it is not exhaustive, and in some cases ""underestimates the number of projects associated with a company,"" admitted Oriane Wegner and Lou Welgryn. It also sometimes contains out-of-date information.All that remained was to shed light on the financial players behind these companies. To do this, CarbonBombs.org relied on the ""Banking on Climate Chaos"" report, which each year lists the main financial flows between the world's major banks and the energy sector. While this work, carried out by NGOs, is criticized in its methodology by banking establishments, it is considered one of the best sources of information on the subject, due to a lack of transparency on the part of the main stakeholders. ""Today, opacity complicates the debate and plays into the hands of the financial players who continue to finance pollution. Making information available in a clear and accessible way would go a long way toward accelerating the transformation of the financial sector,"" explained Lucie Pinson, director of Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs behind the report.Because of these methodological barriers, this aggregation work provides a rich but non-exhaustive view of the web of players involved in carbon bombs. ""CarbonBombs.org is intended to be continuously enriched in the future, to refine and update information on projects, companies and their financing by banks,"" said the co-founders of Eclaircies, who added that it has been designed according to the logic of open source, ""with the desire that the progress of some can be reused to advance those of others, and to enable citizen ownership of this subject.""",/en/les-decodeurs/
'Carbon bombs': TotalEnergies is the world's second-largest extractor from huge deposits,Investigation,"In the intense competition among private enterprises for fossil fuel extraction, the world champion is French. In times gone by, this accolade might have flattered French patriotism. But, in a world where there is increasing urgency to drastically reduce oil, gas and coal production to limit the scale of climate change, the distinction is harder to accept.The data compiled by the French NGOs Eclaircies and Data For Good as part of the CarbonBombs.org survey, revealed by Le Monde, show that TotalEnergies is linked to at least 23 ""carbon bombs"" – vast fossil fuel extraction sites identified by scientists as having the greatest potential for greenhouse gas emissions over their lifecycle.They place the French group second in the world rankings of companies developing carbon bombs, behind the state-owned mining company China Energy and its 41 coal mines.The 23 oil and gas bombs for which TotalEnergies is an operator or shareholder could release more than 60 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) into the atmosphere if fully exploited. This represents 12% of humanity's total remaining carbon budget to keep global warming below the 1.5°C threshold, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).In recent months, public attention has largely focused on the oil drilling project led by the group in Tilenga, Uganda. Many environmental organizations fear that this project, coupled with the giant East African Crude Oil Pipeline, poses a threat to local populations, water resources and biodiversity. In an unusual move, the European Parliament has even called on TotalEnergies to reconsider its plans to preserve these ""protected and sensitive"" areas. In terms of potential CO2 emissions, estimated at 400 million tonnes, Tilenga is nonetheless a dwarf compared with other drilling operations by the French company. As the environmental NGO Greenpeace pointed out in a recent report, this ""tree"" hides a ""forest of climate bombs.""One of TotalEnergies' first but much lesser-known carbon bombs lies 5,000 meters beneath the Caspian Sea off the coast of Kazakhstan. The oil accumulated in the offshore Kashagan field, in which TotalEnergies holds a 17% stake, is likely to release more than 5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere once its reserves are used up.Production from this giant field began in November 2016, just days after the Paris climate agreement came into force, which urged humanity to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Like Kashagan, many carbon bombs connected with TotalEnergies were brought into production after this major deadline in the fight against global warming. This includes the underwater oil fields of Libra and Mero off the coast of Brazil and the massive Yamal gas project in the Russian Arctic, both launched in 2017, as well as the Johan Sverdrup oil drilling in Norwegian waters, which started in 2019.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Storm Ciaran: How do storms get their names?,"    The World Meteorological Organization delegates the choice of names, which must alternate between masculine and feminine, to five regional bodies. ","Ciaran, Harvey, Irma, Carmen, Otis...Hurricanes and storms all have names, either male or female. Here's how the two main organizations that name storms worldwide choose them.It all depends on which country the storm hits first. Since 2017, Europe has been divided into five zones, within which the weather services collaborate to jointly name the latest phenomenon.In the case of Ciaran, which is due to hit the north-western quarter of France at night on Wednesday, November 1, the group containing Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands chose this name – a tribute to Ciarán Fearon, a Northern Irish civil servant working in flood monitoring.For the rest of the world, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is the main authority. However, it only names a storm if it exceeds wind speeds of 119 km/h and is accompanied by torrential rain. This organization then delegates the task of choosing names to five regional bodies.The WMO explains on its website that the primary reason for naming hurricanes is to ""help in the quick identification of storms in warning messages because names are presumed to be far easier to remember than numbers and technical terms,"" as was the case in the past.Similarly, the WMO explains that it prefers to use names ""that are familiar to the people in each region."" In Japan, the names Usagi, Koguma or Tokage might be used. For Australia, however, Kate, Jack or Fletcher are more likely.The WMO takes the issue of choosing names very seriously, and follows a strict procedure. The five regional bodies responsible for this mission each draw up six lists of first names, one for each letter of the alphabet, which are used in rotation.For example, the name Cindy, which was used to designate a tropical cyclone in June 2017, was reused in 2023. The only reason a name can be removed from the list is ""if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for reasons of sensitivity,"" explains the WMO on its website. Katrina has therefore been removed from the list, as have Mitch, Sandy and Irma, the most powerful hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic.Note that the name ""Isis"" was removed from the list in 2015. Originally given in reference to the Egyptian goddess, it has also become the English-language acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.The Free University of Berlin (FU), meanwhile, has been offering sponsors the ability to buy a name through the ""Adopt a Vortex"" (Aktion Wetterpate) program since 2002. A high-pressure area costs €390, whereas a low-pressure area, which lasts less time and therefore offers less exposure, costs €260. This sum is used to ""support the training of students"" and fund the FU's Berlin-Dahlem synoptic and climatological measuring station.Hurricane names were first given arbitrarily, without any precise rules. ""Antje's Hurricane"" in 1842, for example, took its name from a ship whose mast it destroyed.Since the early 1950s, the WMO had used only feminine names to name hurricanes. This changed in 1979, and since then masculine and feminine names have alternated, in alphabetical order (such as Harvey, Irma, Jose and Katia this year, for example).Germany, meanwhile, waited until the late 90s to address the issue: ""In Germany in 1998, a discussion arose in the media about the procurement rules because of possible discrimination against women. Low-pressure areas [which were given feminine names] are often associated with precipitation and wind, which is often associated with “bad” weather,"" explains the FU's website. Since then, it adds, ""an annually changing cycle was introduced to give the highs and lows alternating female and male first names.""A change that doesn't prevent gender stereotyping. A study conducted by American researchers has shown that hurricanes with feminine names that have hit the US have killed more people than those with masculine names. The reason is not the phenomenon itself, but that hurricanes with female names are perceived as less dangerous than those with male names. Alexander, for example, is perceived as more threatening than Alexandra.",/en/les-decodeurs/
'Carbon bombs': 10 countries account for 78% of emissions linked to major extraction sites,    Ten countries control more than half of the highest carbon emitting drilling sites in the world. They need to stop granting permits for fossil fuel exploitation if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century. ,"If fossil fuels are the ""bombs"" that threaten the climate, who built them? Although much of our attention is focused on energy giants, governments are also responsible for oil and coal extraction projects, because they authorize drilling.A small number of governments control the vast majority of carbon bombs, the 422 extraction sites identified by researchers as having the greatest potential for greenhouse gas emissions over their lifecycle. Ten countries alone are home to more than three-quarters of these coal, oil and gas mega-extraction sites, according to data compiled by the NGOs Data for Good and Eclaircies as part of the CarbonBombs.org survey, revealed by Le Monde and a consortium of international media outlets on Tuesday, October 31.Behind the leading trio of China, the United States and Russia, the main countries where carbon bombs have been identified include the Gulf States (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq, Iran), Australia, Canada, India and Brazil.For oil and gas projects scheduled to come on stream between 2023 and 2050 (and not necessarily considered carbon bombs), the geographical concentration is the same: In a report published in September, the American organization Oil Change International showed that almost 90% of the associated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions come from 20 countries. Burning the hydrocarbons contained in these new extraction sites has the capacity to emit the gigantic sum of 173 billion metric tons (or gigatons) of CO2, the equivalent of 30 years' annual emissions from the US.The US, home to 28 of the 422 carbon bombs listed, is responsible for more than a third of oil and gas expansion projects, ahead of Russia and Canada.During the 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden promised not to authorize any new drilling on federal land. In his first two years in office, forced by court rulings and the Republican-majority Congress, the president approved more oil and gas drilling than his predecessor, Donald Trump. At the end of September, however, the administration announced that only three new areas could be drilled in the Gulf of Mexico between 2024 and 2029, the lowest number ever proposed. This shift was strongly criticized by the fossil fuel industry, but environmental organizations still think it's not enough.In June, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged world leaders to stop granting new permits for fossil fuel exploration and production. For governments, issuing permits at different stages of a project's development is a major lever for curbing expansion. At the end of 2020, Denmark, the European Union's biggest oil producer, put an end to all new exploration in the North Sea.

Why France's justice minister is being tried for conflicts of interest,In Depth,"Justine Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti's trial opens on Monday, November 6, before the Court of Justice of the Republic (CJR). It is the first time a serving minister is tried by this special jurisdiction, which judges members of the French government for crimes and misdemeanors committed in the exercise of their duties.Dupond-Moretti, who was a renowned criminal lawyer before he was appointed justice minister on July 6, 2020, is facing charges of conflicts of interest brought by the CJR's investigating committee, following a lengthy probe. He is accused of having used his office to attempt to obtain disciplinary sanctions against four magistrates who had investigated his clients or friends, in two separate cases.The first case is Edouard Levrault's. Posted to the Principality of Monaco in 2016, this investigating judge probed several sensitive cases and indicted influential figures in a corruption case: the Russian billionaire Dmitri Rybolovlev, who is the president of AS Monaco football club; Christophe Haget, the head of Monaco's judicial police; and Philippe Narmino, who was serving as Monaco's equivalent to a minister of justice.Judge Levrault was not renewed in his position in 2019, at the request of Narmino's successor, who complained to the French government that the judge ""takes the liberty of raising suspicions about all sorts of people"" and ""[wishes] to investigate inside the palace [of the prince of Monaco].""Interviewed by France 3 television's Pièces à Conviction program on June 10, 2020, Judge Levrault replied in unflattering terms regarding the complacency of Monaco's justice system, following in the steps of several French judges who have spent time in the principality. The judge suggested that he was dismissed for having implicated Rybolovlev and Haget in his investigations. Dupond-Moretti, as a lawyer for the two men, did not take kindly to this criticism, and two days later described the judge as a ""cowboy"" in an interview with the local newspaper Monaco-Matin. Haget announced that he was filing a complaint for violation of the secrecy of the investigation and requested that France's Conseil Supérieur de la Magistrature (CSM), the body tasked with appointing and disciplining judges, be asked to sanction Levrault for a ""dereliction of duty.""Just days later, on July 6, 2020, Dupond-Moretti was chosen by President Emmanuel Macron to become the justice minister. The appointment to the head of the French judiciary of a lawyer involved in a number of high-profile cases placed him de facto in a situation of conflicts of interest, raising concerns among many parties in the judiciary.On July 31, 2020, Dupond-Moretti's chief of staff, Véronique Malbec, ordered the Inspectorate General of Justice (IGJ), an oversight body under the minister's control, to launch an administrative inquiry into Levrault. The probe was to examine both his comments in the television program and the conduct of his investigations in Monaco. The decision was strongly criticized by magistrates, and prompted the then prime minister, Jean Castex, to issue two decrees in the autumn of 2020 recusing Dupond-Moretti from any cases ""in which he has been a lawyer or in which he has been involved.""Levrault was referred to the CSM by Castex himself, at the end of the administrative inquiry, in September 2021. The judge was cleared one year later: the magistrates' disciplinary body found that he had not been guilty of any dereliction of duty.Meanwhile, the case turned against Dupond-Moretti. The CSM criticized him for having placed himself ""in an objective situation of conflict of interest"" by ordering the investigation into the judge, even though he had been a stakeholder in the case just a month before. While the minister tried to minimize his role in the disciplinary proceedings against Levrault during the CJR's investigation, the investigating committee found that he had not kept away from his former cases, as ordered in the recusal decrees. The judges documented numerous meetings between the minister and key players from the Levrault case:The CJR's investigating committee therefore considered that Dupond-Moretti actively sought to use his prerogatives to punish an anti-corruption judge who was investigating his clients.The second case for which Dupon-Moretti will be judged follows a similar pattern. It involves three judges from the National Financial Prosecutor's Office (PNF), a section of the Paris Court specializing in economic and financial crime.It all began in early 2014. As part of an investigation into suspected Libyan financing of Nicolas Sarkozy's first presidential campaign, judges tapped the former president on a phone line taken out in the name of Paul Bismuth by his lawyer, Thierry Herzog. The police soon realized that someone had tipped off Sarkozy and his entourage to the eavesdropping. The PNF opened an investigation (called ""306"") to identify the source of the leak. As part of the investigation, the police scrutinized the detailed records of 20 phone lines belonging to persons of interest to their investigation, including those of Dupond-Moretti, a close friend of Herzog.When Dupond-Moretti discovered, in June 2020, after revelations by the magazine Le Point, that his telephone communications had been studied, the lawyer raged against what he called ""a clique of judges who allow themselves everything."" He announced, on June 30, 2020, that he was filing a complaint for ""violation of the intimacy of private life and the secrecy of correspondence"" and ""abuse of authority.""The next day, Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet asked the IGJ to look into the PNF's ""investigation 306."" But six days later, Dupond-Moretti replaced her at the ministry, making him the superior of the prosecutor against whom he had lodged a complaint. The situation immediately drew fierce criticism. To allay concerns expressed by magistrates, Dupond-Moretti withdrew his complaint on July 14, 2020.Two months later, on September 15, 2020, the IGJ delivered its report on the PNF, pointing to management problems within the agency, but emphasizing that ""investigation 306"" was perfectly legal and that the magistrates had been careful ""not to excessively expose the private lives or professional secrecy of the owners of the lines operated."" The only purpose of an operational inspection like the IGJ's is to audit the quality of a department's organization, not to point the finger at individual responsibilities. In theory, therefore, the investigation into the PNF should only have been followed by reforms to its organization.But to everyone's surprise, on September 18 Dupond-Moretti's chief of staff ordered administrative investigations into the head of the PNF, Eliane Houlette, and two of the seven judges in charge of ""investigation 306,"" Ulrika Delaunay-Weiss and Patrice Amar. In an unprecedented move, the minister publicly cited the names of the three magistrates in a press release, shocking the judiciary and violating the secrecy of the administrative investigation.Dupond-Moretti and Malbec denied they had sought to obtain baseless sanctions against these magistrates, but the CJR's investigation showed the opposite: the day before the IGJ's report was officially handed in, the minister instructed a senior Ministry official to assess the report and draft the letter justifying the launch of three administrative investigations. The next day, Dupond-Moretti told Sophie Rey, the secretary general of the CSM, that he intended to refer the matter to the CSM to sanction the magistrates, even though the administrative investigation had not begun.Later, Castex indeed referred Houlette and Amar to the CSM, even though the IGJ report concluded that they had ""acted within the law."" The hearings conducted by the CJR showed that the prime minister's office intervened with the Directorate of Judicial Services (DSJ) to refer Houlette to the CSM, going against the DSJ's analysis that none of the magistrates should be prosecuted. Amar's referral to disciplinary proceedings, meanwhile, was decided unilaterally by the PM's office, which disregarded the recommendations of both the IGJ and the DSJ.The CSM's final decision on October 19, 2022, proved Castex and Dupond-Moretti wrong. It cleared the two magistrates, saying they had ""committed no disciplinary fault,"" and deemed that there were ""no grounds"" for sanctioning them.As in the Levrault case, the procedure backfired on Dupond-Moretti. For both cases, the minister was charged with illegal conflicts of interest on July 16, 2021, and was referred to trial on October 3, 2022.The hearing, which opens on Monday, November 6, is expected to last until November 17. The minister faces five years' imprisonment, a €500,000 fine and a ban on running for office. He will be judged by a panel of three professional judges, six members of the Assemblée Nationale, and six senators.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Photojournalists 'embedded' with Hamas on October 7: Heavy but unsubstantiated Israeli accusations,"    Israeli officials accused photographers working for foreign media outlets of having 'known about the massacre,' echoing the claim of a pro-Israeli advocacy group, which has since backtracked. ","The accusation was of a rare severity. Israel's official account on X, managed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote on November 9 that AP, CNN, the New York Times and Reuters had journalists embedded with Hamas terrorists during the October 7 massacre, before deleting its message.Israel's war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, went so far as to denounce criminal collusion: ""Journalists found to have known about the massacre, and still chose to stand as idle bystanders while children were slaughtered – are no different than terrorists and should be treated as such,"" he declared, reports nationalist media network Arutz Sheva (known as Israel National News in English).No evidence was found to support these accusations, which were refuted by the major media outlets and by minute-by-minute reconstruction of the events. Through its executive director, Gil Hoffman, Honest Reporting, the group that made the accusations, has since said it was simply ""raising questions"".In an article published on November 8, Honest Reporting, an Israeli website that monitors the Western media and relies in particular on photos from the Associated Press (AP) and Reuters news agencies, explained that six journalists who covered the events of October 7 were able to photograph Palestinians passing through the severed fences, as well as the fighting at the border. They are Hatem Ali, Hassan Eslaiah, Mohammed Fayq, Ali Mahmud, Yousef Masoud, Abu Mostafa and Yasser Qudih.""What were they doing there so early on what would ordinarily have been a quiet Saturday morning? Was it coordinated with Hamas? Did the respectable wire services, which published their photos, approve of their presence inside enemy territory, together with the terrorist infiltrators? Did the photojournalists who freelance for other media, like CNN and the New York Times, notify these outlets?"" the site writes.In the hours that followed, a photograph of Hassan Eslaiah, one of the incriminated photographers, began to circulate. Dating from 2018, it shows him embracing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. In another video, he films himself in front of a burning Israeli tank, without a press jacket, and riding up a road on a motorcycle, holding what appears to be a grenade.Honest Reporting is an organization dedicated to combating alleged anti-Israel bias in the Western media. In the past, it has denounced several journalists for sharing anti-Semitic messages on social media platforms or for revealing links with Islamist movements such as Hezbollah and Hamas. One article notably led CNN to break off its collaboration with Idris Muktar Ibrahim, a producer who had tweeted that he was ""#TeamHitler"".However, this is not a journalistic site, but rather a pro-Israeli advocacy group, which sometimes spreads propaganda, such as the idea that images of Palestinian victims are staged to manipulate international opinion.The Israeli nationalist right accuses Western media of always siding with Palestine. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesperson for the Israeli army reacted to Honest Reporting's publication by explaining that he has always felt that ""Gazan stringers for major western outlets are at best controlled by Hamas or more likely totally part of Hamas propaganda."" And he lamented that ""So much of what the world knows about Gaza is based on these charlatans."" Entry to the enclave is still forbidden to the international press by the Israeli army.While it is possible that in times of conflict, journalists embedded with the army may have knowledge of military plans, there is no evidence that this was the case on October 7, during the Hamas terrorist attack. The speed with which photographers were able to get to the border is explained by the Gaza Strip's small size: 365 km2, half the size of Spain's capital Madrid.Julie Pace, head of AP, said that ""it was clear that morning from the first launch of missiles from Gaza into Israel that something serious was happening."" This is also what Hassan Eslaiah told French newspaper Libération, which was able to reconstruct his morning through his social media posts from an initial video of rocket fire at 6:41 am, to his crossing the border during a Facebook live at 8:27 am, to his arrival on motorcycle at a kibbutz, where the bodies of murdered Israeli civilians already lay, at around 9:30 am.In a wire story, AP reported that the first shots captured that day by AP freelancer Yousef Masoud were ""taken 90 minutes after the attack began,"" undermining the theory of collusion. Reuters published photos taken by Mohammed Fayq, Abu Mostafa and Yasser Qudih, taken more than 45 minutes after the announcement that Hamas attackers had crossed the border. The agency confirmed to Libération that the metadata of the first published photographs, taken at 8:29 am, show that nearly two hours elapsed between the first rocket fire and these shots.The New York Times, which did not publish photos of the journalists quoted that day, defended contributor Yousef Masoud, who immortalized a burning Israeli tank for AP. ""He was doing what photojournalists always do during major news events, documenting the tragedy as it unfolded,"" said the American daily.AP and CNN have both ended their collaboration with Eslaiah, the photojournalist photographed next to the Hamas leader in an apparently complicit posture. The shot dates from 2018, during a meeting between Hamas and journalists, the photographer told Libération. He himself released it in January 2020 for self-promotional purposes ""to prove the authenticity"" of his reporting and show his ""access to the leaders of various Palestinian factions."" ""While we have not at this time found reason to doubt the journalistic accuracy of the work he has done for us, we have decided to suspend all ties with him,"" said CNN.For the rest, the four media outlets cited all denied any knowledge of the planned terrorist attacks in Israel on October 7. In a statement, the New York Times called the accusations ""untrue and outrageous."" It also said it was ""gravely concerned"" about the threats these allegations pose to freelance war photojournalists, who cover conflict zones at great risk to their lives. At least 40 journalists and media workers have been killed since October 7, the highest monthly toll since the Committee to Protect Journalists began recording such deaths in 1992.",/en/les-decodeurs/
German journalist was paid by Russian oligarch for pro-Putin books,"    Confidential documents from the Cyprus Confidential investigation reveal that Hubert Seipel, known for his pro-Kremlin stance, received €600,000 from an offshore company linked to Russian billionaire Alexei Mordashov. ","In June 2021, German journalist Hubert Seipel was invited on the radio to present his latest book, Putins Macht: Warum Europa Russland braucht (""Putin's Power: Why Europe Needs Russia""). He was affable and his tone courteous. But after 15 minutes or so, he suddenly stiffened. The presenter had just asked him if he receives fees from Russia. ""How dare you?"" Seipel exclaimed, dumbfounded.Yet the question was far from trivial. Seipel, known as a specialist in Russian geopolitics, boasts that he is ""the only Western journalist in direct contact with Putin,"" whom he met in 2010 to prepare his documentary I, Putin: A Portrait (2012). As a result, he is frequently criticized for his pro-Kremlin stance. His previous book, published in 2015, had already been widely vilified in the German press for its ""breaches of the most basic journalistic standards.""The Cyprus Confidential investigation has raised the possibility that the Kremlin secretly tried to influence public debate in Germany. It also shed a new light on the journalist's stances. Confidential financial data from Cypriot firm Cypcodirect Corporate Services revealed that his two books were partly financed by offshore companies linked to an oligarch close to the Kremlin, in contradiction with the fundamental rules of journalistic ethics.A ""deed of sponsorship"" was signed, on March 16, 2018, between Seipel and a British Virgin Islands company, De Vere Worldwide Corporation, for ""writing a book on political environment in the Russian Federation."" The confidential document specifies that ""the sponsor wishes to support the development"" of the book by paying the author €600,000 and by providing ""adequate logistical and organizational support,"" adding that ""the author shall have no obligation to the Sponsor in relation to the Project (whether with respect to the content or the composition of the book or otherwise)."" According to the leaked documents, the sum was paid to the journalist in two installments from an account hosted by Russian bank Sovcombank in 2018 and 2019.Another internal document from the Cypriot firm revealed that a ""similar deed"" had been signed in 2013 for a ""Putin biography"" – the subject of Seipel's first book, published in 2015.The advantage of using opaque offshore companies for this type of contract is that the owner, like the money transfers, often remains unknown. Cyprus Confidential documents, however, provided numerous clues as to the identity of the principal player, suggesting that it was Alexei Mordashov – the main shareholder in Russia's largest steel company, Severstal.",/en/les-decodeurs/
"How dirty money and Russian riches flow through Cyprus, a gateway to the EU",Investigation,"Cyprus has a long-standing reputation as a tax haven and haven for Russian oligarchs, who have long indulged criminal money. But a new investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), published simultaneously by 69 news organizations, including Le Monde, sheds a harsh light on the consequences of the Cypriot economic model.Based on the leak of 3.6 million confidential documents from six Cypriot financial services firms – ConnectedSky, Cypcodirect Corporate Services, DJC Accountants, Kallias & Associates, MeritKapital and MeritServus – the Cyprus Confidential investigation confirms that the island in the Mediterranean Sea serves as a gateway for dubious financial transactions in the European Union (EU).Year after year, anti-money laundering authorities have issued warnings, worried about repeated financial scandals. However, due to a lack of political will, the EU has allowed this kind of business to flourish within its borders. Cyprus is a place where shell companies can be registered on a large scale, and Russian money flows abundantly. Russian oligarchs come to the island to take advantage of minimal taxation and long-standing banking secrecy. Among the clients of the six Cypriot firms revealed by this investigation, ICIJ and its partners have identified 96 Russian people who have been sanctioned by the West since 2014 and are linked to at least 800 separate companies or trusts.An opaque financial center, a haven for Russian money, a grey zone for the cyber economy: The Cyprus Confidential investigation tells the story of how Cyprus, a small Mediterranean island, has allowed itself to be overwhelmed by its offshore industry, and has become the European Union's weak link in the fight against dubious financial flows.The investigation is based on the leak of 3.6 million confidential documents from six Cypriot financial services firms (ConnectedSky, Cypcodirect Corporate Services, DJC Accountants, Kallias & Associates, MeritKapital and MeritServus) and the i-Cyprus company register. The leaks were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and the German investigative outlet Paper Trail Media, with the support of Distributed Denial of Secrets, a group of activists campaigning for transparency. The leaks were then shared with 69 international news organizations, including Le Monde.This investigation notably reveals central role of the MeritServus cabinet in managing the offshore empire of Roman Abramovich, a powerful businessman close to Vladimir Putin and the former owner of English football club Chelsea. He holds 14 trusts in Cyprus and around a hundred companies in tax havens.It also shows that the Cypriot branch of the auditing giant PwC helped Alexei Mordachov, one of Russia's wealthiest oligarchs, transfer over $1.4 billion in assets to his wife in March 2022, the day after he was placed under sanctions. The transaction was eventually blocked and the funds remain frozen.On the same day, the multinational company helped two other Russian billionaires, Alexander Abramov and Alexandr Frolov, to carry out an ""urgent"" $100-million transaction between shell companies, shortly before their assets were frozen. PwC has declined to comment on these transactions, but insists that it complied with all applicable regulations.These examples illustrate the excesses of the economic model put in place by the former British colony, based on a hypertrophied financial sector that is largely dependent on Russia. After decades of prosperity, this model has finally ensnared the country – and risks dragging down the whole of the EU.",/en/les-decodeurs/
US Internal Revenue Service demands Microsoft pay $29 billion in unpaid taxes,"    US tech giants' accounting practices have raised concerns, with governments alleging that firms like Apple, Amazon and Microsoft use low-tax jurisdictions to reduce taxes in their primary markets and boost profits. ","The US Internal Revenue Service is asking that Microsoft pay a whopping $29 billion in unpaid taxes from 2004 to 2013, the company said in an official filing on Wednesday, October 11. The case puts further focus on the international tax practices of major multinationals that have been accused in recent years of shifting revenue to lower tax jurisdictions in an effort to avoid higher taxes in their major markets.""We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the (demand) through the IRS's administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings,"" the company said in its filing to the US markets authority. In a blog post, Microsoft said the issue with the IRS was with its transferring of revenue across international jurisdictions during the period. The practice, called cost-sharing, is used by ""many large multinationals...because it reflects the global nature of their business,"" the company said. ""We strongly believe we have acted in accordance with IRS rules and regulations and that our position is supported by case law,"" the blog post added.Reached by AFP, the IRS said it was against US law for it to either confirm or deny an ongoing tax case. Microsoft said that the appeal process with the IRS would take years and if it failed, the company would fight the claim in the courts. The Windows maker said the demand emerged out of a decade-long discussion with the IRS ""about how we allocated our income and expenses for tax years beginning as far back as 2004."" ""We have changed our corporate structure and practices since the years covered by the audit, and as a result, the issues raised by the IRS are relevant to the past but not to our current practices,"" it said. Microsoft added that ""since 2004, we have paid over $67 billion in taxes to the US.""The accounting practices of US big tech companies have long posed a problem for authorities. Governments have accused companies such as Apple, Amazon or Microsoft of shifting revenue through low or zero-tax jurisdictions in order to escape taxation in their main markets and maximize profits. This spurred a major international agreement among 140 countries brokered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that is designed to better share and regulate the tax revenue of the giants.The OECD on Wednesday published a draft agreement implementing a major part of that deal with hopes of having it ratified by the end of the year. In the EU, authorities in 2016 ordered Apple to pay €13 billion in back taxes over similar accounting practices, but Brussels lost an appeal to Apple and is awaiting the outcome of a further appeal.",/en/pixels/
One trillion dollars in seven years: An endless supply of  funding for the expansion of fossil fuels,Investigation,"Petrobras is a perfect case study for anyone seeking to understand the duplicity of the financial system with regard to climate change. The Brazilian oil company plans to invest around €60 billion from 2023 to 2027 to increase its production of crude oil. The projects to be financed include continuing the exploitation of the vast Mero oil field off the coast of Rio. More than 650,000 barrels of oil per day are expected to be produced by this oil field from 2026, representing nearly 1% of global consumption. Petrobras has no intention of financing renewable replacement solutions, of course.The Brazilian company’s superficial climate commitments are considered among the least specific and least ambitious in the sector by the think tank Carbon Tracker. The rating agency MSCI, on the other hand, clearly judges that its current trajectory will lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, with it needing to reduce them by a factor of ten to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement.However, this assessment has not harmed the company when it seeks funding. From 2016 to 2023, Petrobras acquired €39 billion through thirteen financial bond issuances – loans provided by investors and arranged by banking groups. This makes it the third highest-funded fossil fuel company through this method, according to data compiled during the ""Fossil Finance"" investigation, conducted by Investico and Follow the Money, in partnership with a dozen European media outlets, including Le Monde.The Mexican state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) is another example. The company is heavily indebted, entangled in multiple financial and environmental scandals, and has not announced a climate strategy. Nonetheless, it continues to secure funding, including the issuance of €116 billion in bonds over the past seven years. This has allowed Pemex to proceed with its expansion projects, such as investing $13 billion in the Campeche field in eastern Mexico, whose production is expected to start in 2025 and last for approximately 40 years.Pemex, Petrobras, BP, TotalEnergies, Shell, and many more: Our investigation shows that 307 fossil fuel companies that are actively funding expansion projects have together received more than €1 trillion in financial bonds since the beginning of 2016. Each transaction was assisted by very large global banks, including American banks like JPMorgan & Co., Citigroup and Bank of America, as well as European banks such as Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Santander, Crédit Agricole, Société Générale and BNP Paribas.",/en/les-decodeurs/
X social platform starts charging new users for basic features,"    Under the trial, new users in the Philippines and New Zealand will have to pay around $0.75 and $0.85 per year to be able to post on the site. ","The social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, announced Tuesday, October 18, that it has begun charging new users in New Zealand and the Philippines to use basic features like posting messages. X, owned since last year by the billionaire Elon Musk, said in a statement that its new subscription method should ""bolster"" existing efforts to reduce spam and ""manipulation of our platform and bot activity.""Under the trial, new web users in the Philippines and New Zealand will have to pay X around $0.75 and $0.85, respectively, every year, to access basic functions like posting on the site. Those who decline to pay the nominal fee will only have access to a ""read only"" version of the platform, limiting them to reading posts, watching videos and following accounts, the company said.""This will evaluate a potentially powerful measure to help us combat bots and spammers on X, while balancing platform accessibility with the small fee amount,"" it added. Existing users in these countries are not affected.Musk has made a number of controversial changes to the social media firm's management and product since he acquired Twitter last year for $44 billion.

'Marvel's Spider-Man 2' video game is visually stunning but not much else,    Spider-Man's new adventure lets players explore a breath-taking New York City but its plot and gameplay are underwhelming. ,"Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is like catching a glimpse of an old acquaintance whose familiar face, from a distance, has not changed. The latest creation from the California-based Insomniac Games succeeds Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020), the launch title for PlayStation 5 (PS5), and Marvel's Spider-Man (2018), one of the PS4's best-selling games, with over 20 million copies sold.However, it would be wrong to pretend not to have recognized this old friend: While nothing has fundamentally changed in the game, which will be available on PS5 on October 20, there is now an added maturity. It's no longer just one Spider-Man, but two who guide the story: 25-year-old Peter Parker and 17-year-old Miles Morales, whose destinies alternate and intertwine.The world, too, has doubled in size. In addition to the island of Manhattan, there are now neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens. A flying suit takes us from one side of this enlarged map to the other, where we can pick up numerous secondary objectives, glean experience or collect bonuses that will allow our characters to evolve.As nimble as Spider-Man, this blockbuster has shrugged off the weight of time despite its unsurprising specifications. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is striking in its ability to capture the torments of adolescence. We accompany Miles Morales as he tries to cope with the death of his father. But we also follow Peter Parker, now endowed with the dark powers of Venom, as a metaphor for his passage to adulthood.The gameplay, which alternates spectacular action phases, simplistic puzzles, teenage comedy scenes and rooftop exploration of the American metropolis, will appeal to those of the same age as its superheroes. For the rest of us, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is as regressive and comforting as a tub of popcorn with a movie. It will appeal to both fans of teen movies and those who grew up with Sam Raimi's comics or films. The latter fans will appreciate this rather classic but solid retelling of the universe after the experimental – and stunning – approach of the animated film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, released in May.For others, the splendid New York panoramas presented here will arouse some unexpected nostalgia: for all the films and TV series that have used the same skyline. Arriving in Little Odessa brought back memories of James Gray's 1994 film of the same name. It's hard to pass in front of the Washington Square Park arch without thinking of Rob Reiner's When Harry Met Sally (1989), or to refrain from looking for the street on which the Manhattan Bridge in Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America (1984) was filmed.Add to this references to the history of New York music, from jazz (a secondary mission consists of recovering Charlie ""Bird"" Parker's saxophone) to hip-hop. And we find ourselves transformed into a veritable video game tourist within the iconic metropolis, tempted to switch to photo mode at every evocative street corner.It's an exploration full of surprises and details that almost made us forget that the main plot (a story of bloody safari, in which the supervillain Kraven is the hunter and characters endowed with superpowers his prey) seemed a little lacking. In the face of the ambition of other open-world games on offer this year, such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or Starfield, this Spider-Man is in the end rather faithful to the character traits of its original hero Peter Parker: modest but charming.We liked:We liked less:It's more for you if:It's not for you if:6 spider legs out of 8.",/en/pixels/
Israel-Hamas war: Social media platforms caught up in accusations of 'partisan' moderation,"    For the past 10 days, Facebook, X, YouTube and TikTok have been accused of alternately 'censoring' pro-Palestinian accounts or of inaction against Hamas. ","Since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, and even more so since the start of the Israeli strikes on Gaza, social networks have been accused of siding either with the Palestinians or, more often, with Israel. There have been accusations of ""censorship"" or, at the very least, unequal treatment. As early as October 10, Elon Musk, the chairman of X (formerly Twitter), posted a meme on his personal account mocking the ""mainstream media,"" which, he claimed, simultaneously accused his platform of being ""an anti-Semitic cesspool"" and ""a Zionist propaganda machine.""More than the media, it is above all the users of the major social media platforms, and mainly Palestinians and defenders of the Palestinian cause, who have been behind the proliferation of ""censorship"" accusations leveled at platforms over the past week. A simple search on any social media network will bring up hundreds of accounts from users claiming to have been shadow banned: a practice that consists of not closing an account but reducing its visibility by limiting its appearance in news feeds or searches.The practice of shadow banning exists on all the leading platforms, even if they all dispute the term, which is considered too loaded. On X, YouTube, Facebook or TikTok, accounts that have been the subject of numerous reports or have been repeatedly sanctioned for breaking the rules can find themselves partly made ""invisible."" Similarly, a post containing violent images or suspicious keywords will automatically be less widely circulated than average.For the past week, it's mainly been TikTok and Instagram – two platforms very popular with teenagers and young adults – that have been accused of hiding pro-Palestinian messages, or even of ""doing Israel's bidding."" ""The suggestion that we're trying to suppress a particular community or point of view is categorically untrue,"" replied Meta (owner of Instagram). ""Our policies are designed to give everyone a voice while keeping people safe on our apps, and we apply these policies regardless of who is posting or their personal beliefs."" The company also explained that it has corrected a bug that made certain Stories not very visible, but asserted that the problem had been widespread.With the exception of the special case of Telegram, which does little or no moderation, all the major platforms have announced that they have applied very similar rules since the Hamas attack. TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube explain that they have deployed more moderators, including Hebrew or Arabic speakers; taken steps to limit live video broadcasts, which are more difficult to moderate; and say they apply ""public interest rules"" on a case-by-case basis. This may lead them to leave normally forbidden content online – typically graphic images that are evidence of an incident. X is the only major social media platform not to have announced an increase in its moderation staff. Since Elon Musk's takeover of the company a year ago, most of the service providers handling the site's moderation have not been retained.",/en/pixels/
US states sue Meta over harm to youth mental health,    Dozens of US states have filed a lawsuit accusing the company of contributing to the youth mental health crisis by designing features on its social media platforms to be addictive for young users. ,"Dozens of US states on Tuesday, October 24, accused Facebook and Instagram owner Meta of profiting ""from children's pain,"" damaging their mental health and misleading people about the safety of its platforms. ""In seeking to maximize its financial gains, Meta has repeatedly misled the public about the substantial dangers of its Social Media Platforms,"" argued a joint lawsuit filed in federal court in California.In total more than 40 states are suing Meta, though some opted to file in local courts rather than join in the federal case. Meta has exploited young users by creating a business model designed to maximize the time they spend on the platform despite harm to their health, the legal filing argued.""Kids and teenagers are suffering from record levels of poor mental health and social media companies like Meta are to blame,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement announcing the suit. ""Meta has profited from children's pain by intentionally designing its platforms with manipulative features that make children addicted to their platforms while lowering their self-esteem.""The suit accuses Meta of deceptive and unlawful conduct harming vulnerable youth for financial gain. The suit urges the federal court to order Meta to stop manipulative tactics and pay hefty financial penalties along with restitution, according to James. ""Social media companies, including Meta, have contributed to a national youth mental health crisis and they must be held accountable,"" James said.Meta said it was ""disappointed"" by the suit and that the states were not working with the array of social media companies to create age-appropriate standards. Meta maintained that it has developed more than 30 tools in its apps to support teenage users, and made it easier for parents to ""shape"" online activity.The Silicon Valley tech firm contended it is disappointing that attorneys general have singled out Meta instead of seeking industry-wide solutions given the popularity of rivals including TikTok, YouTube and Snap. Social media can also be a place where young people struggling with other issues in their lives go to find support of community, Meta maintained.The legal complaints resulted from a nationwide investigation announced in November of 2021, according to California attorney general Rob Bonta. ""Our bipartisan investigation has arrived at a solemn conclusion: Meta has been harming our children and teens, cultivating addiction to boost corporate profits,"" Bonta said in a release. ""With today's lawsuit, we are drawing the line.""The investigation was launched after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked more than 20,000 pages of internal documents to the media sparking criticism that the social media giant had put profit before the security of its users. During testimony to American and European lawmakers in 2021, she insisted that Facebook failed to curtail toxic content and that the company cannot be trusted to change its ways.Facebook later that year changed its name to Meta in a move critics suspected was intended to distance the company from its social networking controversies. Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg defended the company at the time, saying that ""the argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical.""",/en/pixels/
The EU and the UK diverge in strategies to regulate AI,"    On October 24, the EU aims to finalize the Artificial Intelligence Act. In November, the UK and Japan will host AI summits. However, despite their shared interest in AI, national strategies vary. ","OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Meta aren't the only ones racing to play leading roles in artificial intelligence (AI). Political leaders are also vying with each other to create frameworks for – and to promote – software capable of performing human tasks, such as text and image generators ChatGPT and Midjourney. On Tuesday, October 24, the European Union hopes to reach a political agreement on the Artificial Intelligence Act, or at least compromise on the main points of this draft regulation.Then, on November 1 and 2, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will welcome representatives of foreign governments and tech giants to London for an ""international AI safety summit."" Later in November, the G7 countries will gather for a meeting on the ""Hiroshima Process,"" an AI discussion that began in Japan in May.This convergence illustrates a sense of political urgency to take hold of a technology considered at once highly promising and worrying. But in this frenzy – the US, the OECD and China are also active – strategies differ.In 2021, Brussels launched the world's first major legislative project on AI: The AI Act prohibits certain uses (""social rating"" systems, ""subliminal techniques"" for manipulation), and for uses deemed ""high-risk"" (autonomous driving, screening resumes, granting bank loans), it imposes obligations, such as minimizing error rates and discriminatory biases, checking the quality of training data, etc.On the controversial point of ""general-purpose"" AI models (such as those generating text or images), the path of compromise between the European Parliament and the member states consists of imposing obligations on the largest models (above a threshold of computing used for training, or a number of users or corporate clients in the EU, according to a document cited by Contexte). Software manufacturers should also ensure that they have taken steps to respect the ""copyright"" of content used for training.As for London, which wants to become an AI capital, it has chosen to focus on the risks deemed most existential. According to a draft joint declaration from the summit, reviewed by Euractiv, these are linked to ""intentional misuse"" – to generate computer attacks or biological weapons – or to ""issues of control"" of an AI that could escape humans. The statement is reminiscent of alarmist letters calling for AI to be ""paused,"" or deeming it as dangerous as ""pandemics or nuclear war.""The British approach also matches the rhetoric of the industry giants: The summit focuses on ""frontier AI models,"" the term used by OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Anthropic when they created an industry group of the most powerful software manufacturers in June. London also aims to create a kind of ""IPCC of AI,"" a panel of experts inspired by the one charged with informing governments about climate – an idea also championed, in an op-ed in the Financial Times, by several executives working in the field of AI.",/en/pixels/
"Encryption 'backdoors,' an unenforceable yet recurring political objective","French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said that he would like to force encrypted messaging services to introduce 'backdoors' to make them available to authorities. Although this proposal regularly crops up in political discussions, it remains impossible to implement.","Interviewed on BFM-TV on Thursday, October 19, Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin pointed to a convenient target to explain why the terrorist who murdered French teacher Dominique Bernard in Arras on Friday, October 13, was able to act even though he was under close surveillance by intelligence services: messaging applications.""Until recently, traditional phone tapping gave us information about serious crime and terrorism. Today, people use Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, Facebook, etc. (...) These are encrypted messaging systems (...) We need to be able to negotiate what you call a 'back door' with these companies. We need to be able to say, 'Mr. Whatsapp, Mr. Telegram, I suspect that Mr. X may be about to do something, give me his conversations.'""The argument seems to be based on common sense, and Darmanin has said he is in favor of changing the law to require platforms to provide the content of encrypted messages when requested by the authorities. The problem, however, is that these requests run counter to laws that are far more difficult to change than those of the France: the laws of mathematics.The ""end-to-end"" encryption used by applications such as Signal and WhatsApp works on a simple principle: it makes messages readable only by the sender and the recipient. When you send a photo, a link or a few words to a friend on Signal, for example, only the recipient has the ""key"" to open the virtual padlock which makes the message unreadable. Not even the messaging app administrator knows the key.If a message is intercepted in transit from one phone or computer to another, it will only be possible to see a sequence of incomprehensible numbers and letters that are virtually impossible to decipher, given the robustness of today's algorithms. What's more, these applications do not keep copies of transmitted messages. It is therefore impossible to ask ""Mr. Whatsapp"" or ""Mr. Telegram"" to provide messages after the fact.As things stand, the only effective way for investigators to read the content of WhatsApp or Signal conversations is simply to gain access to the phones or computers used by one or more participants in a conversation. In fact, Darmanin pointed out that this is what the agents monitoring the perpetrator of the Arras attack had tried to do, by stopping him the day before the attack in the hope of getting their hands on his cell phone, without success.The process is random, which is why Darmanin – like a long list of politicians around the world before him – is calling for the creation of a ""back door."" In practical terms, this means requiring companies that manage messaging applications to provide the authorities with a ""secret key"" that can decrypt any message, or intentionally slip a loophole into the encryption algorithm to then give government services access.",/en/pixels/
Alphabet and Microsoft report strong profits driven by AI and cloud computing,"    While Microsoft's Azure cloud service outpaces expectations with 29% revenue growth, Alphabet faces challenges in its cloud division, prompting various investor reactions. ","Google parent Alphabet and computing colossus Microsoft Tuesday, October 24, reported that quarterly profits climbed on demand for cloud computing enhanced with artificial intelligence. Microsoft saw its shares rise more than 3 percent to $341.11 on earnings which underscored the momentum of its cloud business. Alphabet share prices, however, slipped more than 5 percent to $129.67 in after-market trades Tuesday despite beating overall earnings expectations as investors had evidently hoped Google Cloud would be doing better.""Google Cloud missed consensus revenue expectations on slowing growth, and we believe consistent with the view that newer (generative artificial intelligence) workloads will take time to move the needle,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note to investors. Alphabet reported a quarterly profit of $19.7 billion, powered by money taken in from ads, YouTube, and cloud services. Alphabet logged $76.7 billion in revenue, versus $69 billion in the same period a year earlier.""We see AI as a foundational platform shift and are excited about the opportunities across our business,"" Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai said during an earnings call. ""Through it all we are making sure the product works well and we are generating value."" Consumers and investors have been keenly watching how companies take advantage of artificial intelligence, and Google along with Microsoft and OpenAI are considered leaders in the technology.But Alphabet has largely been seen as playing catch up with Microsoft, with questions over whether the mighty Google search engine will withstand developments in AI. Microsoft was quick to beef up its Bing search engine with AI powers, but Google's search has yet to see a real threat to its dominance and continues to hold about 90 percent of the market worldwide.Google, like most big tech companies, saw its share price rise steeply in 2023 as investors expected AI to generate new revenue and open new markets. ""It is a testament to the nature of Google's market dominance in search and ads that it can beat (earnings) estimates and have its stock sag immediately afterwards,"" said Insider Intelligence analyst Max Willens. ""Cloud computing is a much lumpier business than advertising, and one where Google is facing stiff competition.""While Google may gain traction making money from AI in the long run, its Cloud unit for now is not enough to sate investors, Willens added. Revenue in Alphabet's cloud division, which infuses AI into its services, was $8.4 billion in the quarter, compared to $6.7 billion in the same period a year earlier.Tech giant Microsoft said Tuesday its profits rose in the latest quarter, boosted by its strength in the closely watched cloud services segment. The company exceeded expectations to report a net income of $22.3 billion for the July to September period, up 27 percent from a year ago. All eyes have been on Microsoft's artificial intelligence and cloud computing performance, and a key aspect is the Azure cloud service, which competes with Amazon's AWS and Google Cloud.""We're making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere,"" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said on an earnings call. ""We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role in the business process to drive productivity gains.""In the latest quarter, revenue growth for Azure and other cloud services came in at 29 percent from a year ago, a slightly faster pace than the three months prior. Overall, the company reported $56.5 billion in sales for the quarter, also higher than anticipated. Microsoft shares surged by 4.6 percent in after-hours trading.The latest earnings report comes shortly after Microsoft closed its blockbuster acquisition of Activision Blizzard, whose video games include ""Call of Duty,"" sealing one of the biggest technology tie-ups in history.",/en/pixels/
UN chief establishes panel to advise on global governance of artificial intelligence,"    UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Thursday announced the appointment of a global advisory panel to report on international governance of artificial intelligence and its risks, challenges and key opportunities. ","The UN secretary-general on Thursday, October 26, set up a panel of experts to make recommendations in the field of artificial intelligence, a technology with ""transformative potential"" yet also great risks to democracy and human rights. ""The last year has seen an extraordinary advance in the capabilities and use of artificial intelligence (AI), through chatbots, voice cloning, image generators, video apps and more,"" Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.He called on the panel to race ""against the clock"" and make recommendations on how to govern the use of AI by the end of 2023, identifying the risks it poses and the opportunities it presents. ""In our challenging times, AI could power extraordinary progress for humanity,"" Guterres said, referring to advances in areas like public health, education and even the fight against climate change. ""But all this depends on AI technologies being harnessed responsibly.""He said the groundbreaking technology is ""concentrated in a handful of companies and countries."" ""The potential harms of AI extend to serious concerns over misinformation and disinformation; the entrenching of bias and discrimination; surveillance and invasion of privacy; fraud, and other violations of human rights,"" he warned. Guterres said he didn't want to enter into doomsday scenarios, but noted that ""AI could undermine trust in institutions, weaken social cohesion, and threaten democracy itself.""Guterres picked some 40 experts in technology, law and personal data protection – coming from academia, government and the private sector – to sit on the panel. They include Amandeep Singh Gill, Guterres's special envoy for technology; James Manyika, vice president in charge of AI at Google and Alphabet; Mira Murati, technical director of ChatGPT developer OpenAI; and Omar al-Olama, minister of AI in the United Arab Emirates.",/en/pixels/
"One year after his Twitter takeover, has Elon Musk kept his promises?",News analysis,"On October 26, 2022, Elon Musk entered Twitter headquarters in San Francisco, California, laughing, carrying a washbasin. After several months of a rocky soap opera, the richest man in the world (at the time) was about to finalize the takeover of the social media network for $44 billion (€41.6 billion) and take possession of the platform.In previous months, the creator of SpaceX set out his vision for relaunching the firm with the bluebird logo and made a whole series of commitments. A year on, these promises, as is often the case with Musk, have not really been kept.Before, during and after the Twitter takeover, Musk said again and again: Transparency is the cardinal virtue that conditions all others, especially for a social media network. Under his leadership, the platform would post moderation sanctions transparently, and he would make the source code of its algorithms public.Above all, over the past year, the billionaire has demonstrated a rather peculiar, even partisan, conception of transparency. In December 2022, he gave internal company documents and messages from the time under the previous management to a handful of conservative or libertarian journalists that he selected. The ""Twitter Files,"" as he then called them, were intended to show that his precursors had censored conservative users and responded favorably to US government requisitions well beyond what the law required.The published articles do reveal mistakes and questionable choices on the part of Twitter's top executives, as well as possibly outrageous demands on the part of the US federal government. But most of the information contained in the ""Twitter Files"" was already known.Since then, Musk has not engaged in any transparency operations on his social media network. The entire staff of the communications department was dismissed and the company no longer responds to any media requests. For several months, any e-mail sent to his press department received an automated ""poop"" emoji as a response.If Musk is to be believed, freedom of speech was his main motivation for buying Twitter: to put an end to the ""censorship"" that he felt affected many users, particularly conservatives. ""I'm against censorship that goes far beyond the law,"" he explained in April 2022. From his very first days at the head of the social media network, he reinstated the accounts of several people who had been banned – unfairly in his eyes, including comedians or journalists, former president Donald Trump, along with neo-Nazi and conspiracy activists.",/en/pixels/
"What is the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas' unpredictable radical ally?",    Israel has accused the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) of being behind the rocket attack that caused an explosion at Al-Ahli hospital. The second largest armed movement in the Gaza Strip maintains an uncompromising stance in its armed struggle against Israel and is also expanding its influence in the West Bank. ,"Israel has accused the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) of being responsible for the explosion that killed hundreds of people on Tuesday, October 17 at the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza. The Israeli army, which denies any involvement, claimed that it was a rocket misfired by the Palestinian group; the latter has condemned these accusations as unfounded.Less well known than Hamas, the PIJ is characterized by its radicalism and uncompromising armed struggle against Israel. Classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, the Palestinian liberation movement is currently the second largest armed faction in the Gaza Strip after Hamas. How was this organization founded, what battles does it wage, and how does it differ from Hamas?At the heart of the movement were students and intellectuals who had returned from their studies in Egypt, eager to fight Israel's colonial policies. Inspired by Fathi Chikaki – a Palestinian who had affiliations with the Muslim Brotherhood during his medical studies in Egypt and who viewed the 1979 Iranian Islamic revolution as a template for the Arab world – these youthful activists initially attempted to persuade the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood to initiate an armed campaign for the liberation of Palestine. However, the Brotherhood declined.Fathi Chikaki and Abdelaziz Awda, a teacher from Gaza who had also studied in Egypt, joined forces to create the Islamic Jihad movement in Palestine in 1981, six years before the creation of Hamas. In its early days, the movement was made up of young Muslims whose backgrounds ""blended European literary culture and the Muslim reformist movement,"" as noted by Wissam Alhaj, Nicolas Dot-Pouillard and Eugénie Rebillard on the ""La Vie des Idées""  (""The Life of Ideas"") website in 2015. It seeks to distinguish itself from the Brotherhood, which they perceive as excessively rigid in its interpretation of Islam and having forsaken the anti-colonial resistance, as well as from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which they criticize for its secular approach. ""The PIJ, conceived from the outset as a third way, was formed in opposition to these two movements,"" said Leïla Seurat, a political scientist and researcher at the Arab Center for Political Research and Studies (CAREP), to Le Monde in 2022.Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 triggered the movement's activism. The PIJ established itself in neighboring countries (Lebanon, Syria, Iran) and began to preach in universities and mosques (a former stronghold of the Muslim Brotherhood) to bring the armed struggle to the Palestinian territories. ""While the movement spent its early years building its base in Gaza, it launched its first military operations in 1984, five years before Hamas,"" explained Erik Skare, a specialist in the movement and researcher at the University of Oslo, in a book published in 2021, A History of Palestinian Islamic Jihad: Faith, Awareness, and Revolution in the Middle East. Initially, due to limited resources, their operations consisted of knife attacks, which evolved during the first Intifada (1987-1993) into stone-throwing and Molotov cocktail attacks.",/en/les-decodeurs/
"In Montreal too, being a woman in tech is not that easy","    In this Quebec hub of artificial intelligence research, women hold only 22% of sector positions, mostly in human resources, not in developer roles. Gender stereotypes are a major barrier to recruitment, although female success stories do exist. ","""Let's take power!"" Marie-José Montpetit, a doctor of electrical and computer engineering, was invited to participate in a discussion in Montreal in March focusing on the role of women in the fields of science, technology, and artificial intelligence (AI). She promoted the idea that ""jobs in innovation are fascinating because it's here that we have the power to change the world.""To hear this sexagenarian from Quebec with a dazzling career behind her – 20 years working for the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) computer science laboratory in Boston –, ""it's time to act."" In fact, women have already begun attacking the stronghold that is the high-tech world, a powerful business sector in the Quebec metropolis. MILA, Quebec's artificial intelligence institute, was set up there in 2017, headed by charismatic director Yoshua Bengio. The result is one of the largest concentrations of academic deep-learning researchers in the world.Some 30 technology giants, including Meta, Google, Ericsson and Microsoft, have also established their research centers in Montreal, and hundreds of start-ups have joined this ecosystem. By 2022, this high-tech sector, from video games to AI, accounted for nearly 263,000 jobs across Quebec, largely concentrated in the city of lights. Women held 22% of the positions.That's not a lot, yet it's better than in France, where 25% of students who choose a degree in the digital field are female but only 13% of them decide to make it their profession. It's also better than 20 years ago in Quebec, it should be noted.The Quebec government and the province's universities, along with the many associations involved in promoting women in this buoyant economic sector, are stepping up initiatives: on the one hand, to attract young women to these scientific fields – scholarships and computer coding courses are specifically aimed at them – and, on the other, to encourage companies to recruit them.Yet even those who have reached the most prestigious roles in this sector agree: certain clichés die hard. The image of the geek, with his hood up engrossed in coding in his basement before becoming Mark Zuckerberg (founder of Meta, formerly Facebook), Elon Musk (X, formerly Twitter) or Steve Jobs (Apple), promoted by the entire film industry since the early 2000s, is so deeply rooted in everyone's mind that it remains difficult for a woman to imagine herself in this world of men, to sneak in after them and then stay there.",/en/pixels/
"Elon Musk, the disinformed disinformer","    In just one year, the Tesla and SpaceX boss has transformed Twitter into X, a social media network where fake news proliferates. But he himself is a victim of this ecosystem, with his naiveté and gullibility shining through. ","It is possible to become the key master and then use those keys to lock yourself up in a narrow prison. This is the paradox of Elon Musk, who became owner and boss of Twitter (becoming X in July) on October 27, 2022, and a year later, seemed in every way to be a mental prisoner of the platform.Of course, when the capricious boss of Tesla Motors and SpaceX got his hands on the social media network with the blue bird, the former was not a rumor-proof genius, nor the latter a haven for measured discussion. Twitter was already known for its chaos, and the former world's richest man was known for his immoderate use of the platform – so much so that after being accused of manipulating Tesla's stock price through inconsistent posts, Musk pledged to the Wall Street watchdog in 2019, to stop tweeting about his company.But the marriage between the most politically scrutinized social media network and the most unpredictable billionaire soon gave birth to a festival of fanciful, tendentious and provocative allegations. No sooner had Twitter been bought out than the polarizing entrepreneur released a homophobic conspiracy theory, which he'd found on a far-right conspiracy site (something for which he later apologized). A few weeks later, as his brutal management sowed discord, he insinuated that a former Twitter employee, with whom he was in conflict, promoted the sexualization of children. He had already called a cave diver a pedophile after the man had the misfortune to criticize Musk's ideas in 2018. Conciliatory, American justice had seen this as mere invective.But for Musk, falsehood isn't just a way of managing his conflicts. It's a garment he sheds increasingly rarely. Without batting an eyelid, the internet entrepreneur shares everything from fake news articles, as from apocryphal quotes, without ever seeming to question their authenticity.In this respect, nothing is more unsettling than studying Musk's sometimes unfiltered reactions to vile assertions. A Trumpist influencer shared a manipulative video, attempting to make it appear against all evidence that the Capitol assailants on January 6, 2021, were escorted in by colluding police. The platform's boss jumped headlong into the trap and wrote ""it's crazy. The public has been misled.""Another far-right influencer – a certain Kanekoa the Great – pondered a graph about the evolution of flu, and pretended to wonder ""where it went in 2020 and 2021?""  Without the slightest critical distance, Musk then commented: ""Good question"" – as if it were not his responsibility to do his own research when picking up the conspiracy refrain. ""Strange,"" he again responded to another far-right account that had just shared a manipulative graphic about racist crime in the US.",/en/pixels/
Crypto entrepreneur Bankman-Fried denies fraud in court,"    While the FTX founder acknowledged some of his failures early in his testimony in federal court on Friday, he has denied that he defrauded anyone and pled not guilty. ","FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried testified at his New York trial on Friday, denying that he defrauded anyone but acknowledging that the innovative business he had hoped would move the cryptocurrency ecosystem forward ended up hurting customers instead.The one-time cryptocurrency golden boy lost his businesses and his reputation as a pioneering entrepreneur in an emerging facet of finance when a rush of customers withdrew their money last year, exposing that billions of dollars were missing.Bankman-Fried, 31, acknowledged some of his failures early in his testimony in Manhattan federal court, saying he made mistakes, large and small. ""We thought we might be able to build the best product on the market"" and move the cryptocurrency system forward, he said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that,"" and a lot of customers and others got hurt, Bankman-Fried said.Asked by his lawyer, Mark Cohen, if he defrauded anyone or took customers' funds, Bankman-Fried answered, ""No I did not."" The California entrepreneur has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy charges accusing him of diverting billions of dollars from his clients and investors to make risky investments, buy luxury housing, engage in a star-studded publicity campaign, and make large political and charitable donations.His much-anticipated testimony became the centerpiece of a defense that has tried to convey that Bankman-Fried had no criminal intent as he took actions that prosecutors say were directly to blame for the collapse last November of businesses Bankman-Fried began creating in 2017 and eventually ran from the Bahamas.Before Bankman-Fried began testifying Friday, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan mostly shut down his lawyers' attempts to suggest to jurors that Bankman-Fried made many decisions about his businesses after consulting with lawyers.  After the jury was sent home Thursday, Bankman-Fried testified in front of the judge about his communications with lawyers as he built his cryptocurrency empire. ""That evidence would, in my judgment, be confusing and highly prejudicial by falsely implying, given testimony yesterday, that lawyers with full knowledge of the facts – all of the facts – blessed what the defendant is alleged to have done. And I didn’t hear that at all yesterday,"" Kaplan said.He did, though, grant a defense request to permit testimony about the involvement of lawyers in data retention policies at Bankman-Fried's businesses that required the frequent deletion of some communications.He was extradited from the Bahamas to New York in December to face fraud charges. Though he was initially granted a $250 million personal recognizance bond and allowed to live with his parents in Palo Alto, California, the bond was revoked in August and he was jailed when Kaplan concluded that he had tried to influence potential witnesses at his upcoming trial.Prosecutors built their case against Bankman-Fried for three weeks, relying largely on his former top executives, an inner circle of individuals who shared a penthouse apartment in the Bahamas with Bankman-Fried. The executives testified that Bankman-Fried directed them to spend billions of dollars taken from the accounts of FTX customers and funneled through Alameda Research, a hedge fund he started in 2017, two years before he created the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.",/en/pixels/
Bluesky: What you need to know before signing up for Twitter's competitor,"    Still unknown just a few months ago, the platform – currently in its beta testing phase – is attracting more and more users tired of the lack of moderation on X (formerly Twitter). ","A doomed experiment or a credible alternative to X (formerly Twitter)? Since its launch in the spring, Bluesky has been attracting more and more users – at least those who manage to get themselves invited. What does this new social media platform look like? Who's behind it? How does it differ from Twitter or Mastodon? What does it intend to achieve? Le Monde tries to answer all your questions.Bluesky is virtually identical to the Twitter interface. You can post short messages, 300-character posts, and images, and subscribe to other users' accounts. Unsurprisingly, you can ""repost"" someone else's message to share it with your followers, or ""like"" it to show your support.The site had 100,000 users at the end of May, rising today to 1.6 million. Yet this sharp rise should be put into perspective: There are still 225 million active accounts on X – though this figure is falling – and Mastodon, a Twitter alternative that launched in 2016, lists 14 million accounts (1.7 million of which are active).Bluesky is still in its beta testing phase and is deliberately limiting the number of accounts through an invitation system. To join the platform, you have to sign up for a waiting list or obtain a code from one of the users already there. Every 10 days or so, they receive one of these golden tickets to distribute.There are, however, already a few large accounts, notably from media outlets such as the Washington Post, the New York Times, Bloomberg, and the American public radio station NPR. Le Monde is also on Bluesky, but it isn't posting anything there.The social media platform has seen waves of registrations, often correlated with announcements by the very polarizing owner of X, Elon Musk. They accelerated with the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, as violent images and videos of the conflict were being widely circulated on X – sometimes manipulated, rarely moderated.In previous months, Bluesky's early users were already praising its good-natured atmosphere, reminiscent of ""Twitter's golden days,"" according to the nostalgic ones. Others, however, have criticized it for this frivolity and a certain cliquishness. Bluesky is also said to be easier to use than Mastodon, a comparable platform in many respects, but with an interface less directly modeled on Twitter.For the time being, Bluesky includes the basic Twitter functionalities, but it's still missing many options that are generally considered basic. Animated GIFs and videos don't work at the moment, as the service's teams acknowledge that they don't yet have the means to moderate them. Nor is it possible to send private messages or create a poll.But even in its prototype state, Bluesky isn't just ""Twitter but worse."" While on X, the algorithm decides what content you'll see, according to rather nebulous criteria, Bluesky allows anyone to create and share their own algorithms – here called ""feeds.""It's possible to subscribe to different feeds and navigate from one to the next in the same way you would switch tabs in your web browser. Among the most popular are ""Top skeets FR,"" which shows the most popular French-language posts; ""Followers,"" which lets you see what your subscribers are posting; ""What's Science,"" which highlights scientific content; and ""Blacksky,"" which aims to amplify messages by the platform's Black users.Note that it is also possible to go without these feeds and simply follow the posts of your subscribers, with no algorithms or advertising.In 2019, Jack Dorsey, then CEO of Twitter, commissioned a team led by Parag Agrawal to devise a technology that would enable social media networks to operate in a decentralized way, connected yet autonomous. One of the theoretical interests of this technology dubbed the ""AT Protocol,"" was to enable more effective moderation, exercised at the level of each network rather than by a central authority. Accordingly, Bluesky is a simplified version of Twitter compatible with the AT Protocol – it will become its showcase.In 2021, when Agrawal replaced Dorsey at the head of Twitter, Bluesky took off and became an independent company. Today, its president is Jay Graber, although Dorsey retains a seat on the board. Bluesky remained funded by Twitter until the end of 2022 and Musk's takeover.Today, it's impossible for users of platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to interact directly with each other: Networks of this kind operate in a vacuum. The proponents of decentralized social media want to develop a protocol that would enable communication from one platform to another, in the same way, that you can have an ""@gmail.com"" mailbox and exchange with the owners of ""@outlook.com"" addresses in a transparent way.Bluesky is not the first to explore this avenue with its AT Protocol. A competing technology, ActivityPub, has enabled users of social media platforms Mastodon and Misskey and the video streaming platform PeerTube to communicate with each other for years. Such an approach has seduced even Facebook: Threads, its new social media platform still officially unavailable in Europe, is destined to join this decentralized galaxy. In the firmament of another galaxy, that of the AT Protocol, a single star shines for the time being: Bluesky. Nevertheless, the engineers behind the project have promised that by early 2024, AT will also be able to accommodate a whole host of applications.But what's the point of launching a new technology, rather than working in concert with the existing one? For the developers of Bluesky and AT, the answer is simple: They emphasize their desire to offer users unprecedented control over their data. The idea is that everyone will be the true owner of their data, and if they decide, for example, to leave Bluesky and join one of its future competitors, they'll be able to take it with them. The downside is that, for the time being, Bluesky offers very little protection for its users' data, and a great deal of normally hidden information is public.The troublesome Dorsey (he actively supports the conspiracy-theorist presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr) is not Bluesky's CEO, but he does sit on its board of directors. However, he deleted his Bluesky account in September and hasn't posted on Twitter since then.Instead, he makes daily use of Nostr, a decentralized social media technology that competes with the ActivityPub and AT protocols and openly relies on the blockchain. Some have seen one of his public pronouncements – ""The only solution is to build on unowned protocols like Nostr and bitcoin"" – as an implicit disavowal of Bluesky. The latter's developers have promised that, while the AT Protocol will be compatible with the blockchain and their competitors will be able to take advantage of it if they wish, Bluesky will not use it.That's the big question. For the moment, no business model is emerging. The only thing you can pay for is a personalized, forgery-proof domain name. While usernames on Bluesky are built on the ""@XXX.bsky.social"" model, it is possible to use a perhaps more elegant domain name, which has the added advantage of proving that you are the person, media, or service you claim to be.For example, the username for Le Monde on Bluesky is not @lemonde.bsky.social, but @lemonde.fr, indicating that the account administrators are the same as the owners of the domain name www.lemonde.fr.Bluesky can be accessed via the official app available on iOS or Android, or on the Bsky.app website. Other alternative tools exist, such as Deck.blue, which reproduces the experience of Twitter's TweetDeck, and the Graysky app, which already lets you post animated GIFs. But first, of course, you'll need to find an invite code.",/en/pixels/
The UK hosts the first global summit on the risks associated with artificial intelligence,    Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wants to propose the creation of a group of international experts tasked with publishing a report on the state of AI. ,"The British media have dubbed it the ""doom summit."" On Wednesday and Thursday, November 1 and 2, at Bletchley Park north of London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government will hold the first global conference devoted to the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). On this former base for British intelligence services – where mathematician Alan Turing managed to decipher the German encryption machine Enigma during World War II – around a hundred executives, business leaders and experts will discuss the existential risks posed by ""Frontier AI"": the most advanced generative AI models, capable of creating extremely elaborate content (video, images, sound, text) in record time.Ahead of the summit, Downing Street, which has surrounded itself with experts of undisputed renown to prepare for this meeting (such as Yoshua Bengio, professor of computer science at the University of Montreal), published its own particularly gloomy conclusions on the risks associated with ""Frontier AI."" From 2030 onward, future generations of these models could help terrorist groups foment chemical attacks, enable cyberattacks of unprecedented scale and effectiveness, manipulate public opinion on a massive scale, and increase unemployment and poverty. They could even escape human control.""I don't want to be alarmist [...] some experts think it will never happen at all. But [...] if they did manifest themselves, the consequences would be incredibly serious. [...] We could look the other way, but we think it's better to face up to this reality, because it's the best thing to do to protect the British people,"" explained Sunak on Thursday, October 26, from the site of the Royal Society of London, one of the world's oldest learned societies. For the 43-year-old leader, who did part of his studies at Stanford University in California and maintains a good network in Silicon Valley, claiming to be ""pro-technology,"" it's not just a matter of scaremongering in an already anxiety-inducing climate.With this summit, which he has instigated and devoted much energy to, the Conservative leader hopes to put the UK firmly on the map with regard to the field of artificial intelligence, as generative models advance at breakneck speed with obvious economic and geopolitical implications. The two giants of AI are China and the US – the latter home to the sector's leading companies (Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Amazon) – but Sunak stressed on Thursday that the UK is ""the best place in Europe to raise capital, all of the leading AI companies choosing the UK as their European headquarters. [...] And AI presents huge opportunities for those who know how to control its risks.""",/en/pixels/
French telecom group Altice is on a precipice,"Patrick Drahi may be playing down Altice's colossal debt, but inflation and rising interest rates are forcing him to take on more debt. The company is teetering on the brink. His business partner's arrest in July, SFR's stagnation and this financial risk may push it over the edge.","""Debt is a zero issue."" On October 17, speaking to staff representatives at Altice France (the parent company of telecoms company SFR and the TV channel BFM-TV) for the first time since the July 13 arrest of his long-time partner Armando Pereira for alleged corruption, Drahi played things down: The company's €24 billion debt would not keep him up at night.Aged 60, the businessman has learned to juggle with bank loans since he went into business in the mid-1990s. He has felt the vertigo of imminent collapse up close. In 2007, for instance, his then-company Numericable was crumbling under €3 billion in debt on just €1 billion in sales. But Drahi never foundered. Each time, he found the financial acrobatics that enabled him to return to equilibrium.In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, in order to stimulate the economy, the major central banks constantly lowered interest rates, even to the point of going negative in the eurozone. And since that was not sufficient, they even went so far as to buy government and corporate debt to ease their burden. It was as if a household purchasing an apartment saw the European Central Bank buy back part of its mortgage.Drahi took advantage of this comfort to do business according to the classic leveraged buy-out (LBO) model developed by investment funds: buying a company on maximum credit and using its profits to pay the interest on debt. It was thanks to cheap money that the businessman managed to buy SFR from Vivendi in 2014 for €13.5 billion, 100% on credit.It was a bold stunt for which the operator is now paying the price. The environment has changed. With the return of inflation, central banks have raised rates to slow economic activity and bring down overheated prices. As a result, money is becoming increasingly expensive. Drahi has realized as much. Even Altice International, his empire's healthiest subsidiary, borrowed €800 million on the financial markets in early October, at a rate of 10.5%, to replace a soon-to-expire line of credit from a loan contracted in July 2020, at a rate of just 2.25%. Altice is paying four times more for its debt than it was three years ago.To reassure, Drahi repeats that Altice France has no repayments scheduled in the short term. The main maturities are in 2027, with €5.4 billion, and then almost double (€9 billion) in 2028. As he told his employees, he is confident that interest rates will fall by then. But if they don't, SFR would struggle to cope: Financial charges would explode beyond its annual repayment capacity. Behind his apparent calm, Drahi has clearly understood the financial risk. Why else would he publicly announce in September that he was ready to sell any of the empire's assets to reduce the group's debt?",/en/pixels/
Disney to complete takeover of Hulu with $8.6 billion deal,"    The deal values Hulu at $27.5 billion in total, according to Disney, which said the transaction will be concluded by December 1. ","The Walt Disney Company on Wednesday, November 1, announced it will buy Comcast's $8.6 billion stake in Hulu, completing its takeover of the streaming service. The acquisition will ""further Disney's streaming objectives,"" the company said in a press release and comes as it strives to boost subscriber numbers at its Disney+ streaming service.The deal values Hulu at $27.5 billion in total, according to Disney, which said the transaction will be concluded by December 1. The California-based entertainment giant already sells Hulu as part of bundled offerings with its Disney+ and ESPN+ platforms. An ad-subsidized bundle of the three services is priced at $15 monthly in the United States, with an ad-free version costing $25 per month.The company will release its latest quarterly earnings next week, providing a look at how its cable and streaming services are doing in the fiercely competitive market. Disney in August reported that Disney+ lost more than 10 million subscribers in the recently ended quarter, in large part in the Indian market. Disney+ finished the second three months of this year with 146.1 million subscribers, compared with just shy of 158 million in the prior quarter, the group said.Disney rival Netflix last month said subscriber numbers grew nearly 11% to 247 million as it cracked down on password sharing and refined an ad-supported tier. The leading streaming service increased prices on some of its plans, perhaps creating an opportunity for competitors such as Disney. Netflix said in an earnings report that its nascent ad-supported offering was gaining traction, and the coming Disney earnings should provide insight into whether the same is true for its ad-supported tier.Meanwhile, film and television makers see productions halted by an actors strike in the United States, meaning a potential lack of fresh content needed to attract and keep streaming subscribers.Hulu was founded in 2007 as a joint venture between News Corporation and NBC Universal, with Disney joining soon after as a partner, according to its website. Disney chief executive Bob Iger said during an earnings call in August that he was confident in the company's long-term trajectory ""despite near-term headwinds."" Iger told financial analysts that streaming, film studios and theme parks will drive its growth in the coming five years.All but a sliver of the loss in Disney+ subscribers took place in India, where the entertainment titan early this year lost rights to stream popular Premier League cricket matches. Disney will release details of upcoming streaming price increases late Wednesday and will make an ad-supported Disney+ tier available in Canada and parts of Europe, according to Iger.",/en/pixels/
Crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty on all counts at FTX fraud trial,    The spectacular rise and fall of the FTX founder hit rock bottom Thursday when a New York jury convicted him of fraud in a scheme that cheated customers and investors of at least $10 billion. The 30-year-old now faces up to 110 years in prison. ,"Sam Bankman-Fried, the one-time cryptocurrency golden boy accused by US prosecutors of stealing billions of dollars of his customers' money, was found guilty on Thursday, November 2, on all counts and now faces up to 110 years behind bars. Following five weeks of trial in New York, the jury reached its decision in just five hours. Sentencing for a man widely known as ""SBF"" will take place at a later date.US Attorney Damian Williams, in a statement after the verdict was announced, said Bankman-Fried had ""perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history, a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the king of crypto."" ""The cryptocurrency industry might be new, players like SBF might be new, but this kind of fraud, this kind of corruption is as old as time and we have no patience for it."" Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried's lawyer, said they were ""very disappointed with the result."" ""Mr. Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and will continue to vigorously fight the charges against him,"" he added.A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a billionaire before the age of 30, Bankman-Fried conquered the crypto world at breakneck speed, turning FTX, a small start-up he co-founded in 2019, into the world's second-largest exchange platform. But in November 2022, the FTX empire imploded, unable to cope with massive withdrawal requests from customers panicked to learn that some of the funds stored at the company had been committed to risky operations at Bankman Fried's personal hedge fund, Alameda Research.During the weeks-long trial, some of his closest associates testified that he was key to all the decisions that saw $8 billion vanish from his FTX trading platform. In closing arguments, prosecutors portrayed the defendant as an extremely smart man consumed by greed who knew what he was doing when FTX funds were secretly funneled to Alameda. The defense said their client had acted in ""good faith"" and was overtaken by circumstances and the financial ineptitude of close associates who testified against him to gain leniency from prosecutors.The star witness in the trial was Caroline Ellison, the former Alameda CEO and Bankman-Fried's on-and-off-again girlfriend. She told the jury that they had stolen ""around $14 billion"" from FTX clients and that Bankman-Fried, as owner of Alameda, ""directed me to commit those crimes."" That money was used to finance venture capital deals, political contributions and swanky real estate in the Bahamas. It also went toward paying tens of millions of dollars to celebrities, including Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen, to gain their endorsement of FTX, as well as buying the naming rights for the Miami Heat's home arena. According to prosecutors, at the time of FTX's collapse, just over $8 billion belonging to customers had vanished into bad investments at Alameda.During his trial, Bankman-Fried admitted he had made ""mistakes"" but denied that he had ever tried to defraud anyone. Prosecutor Nicholas Roos told the jury it had to decide whether ""the defendant knew taking the money was wrong."" ""He knew it was wrong. He did it anyway (and) thought because he was smart he could get away with it,"" the prosecutor argued. Roos pointed out that three witnesses, Ellison and other close associates, each claimed that the ex-cryptocurrency genius had given instructions for Alameda to pilfer the coffers of FTX, virtually without limit.The crypto world was shaken by the rapid collapse of FTX and is just beginning to recover. Underlining the high level of interest in the case, US Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a statement after the verdict thanking prosecutors and the FBI for their ""outstanding work in bringing Mr Bankman-Fried to justice."" ""This case should send a clear message to anyone who tries to hide their crimes behind a shiny new thing they claim no one else is smart enough to understand: the Justice Department will hold you accountable,"" he said.",/en/pixels/
FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty of fraud,    The federal prosecutor declared that the case was a 'a warning to every fraudster who thinks they're untouchable.' The cryptocurrency platform's former CEO faces up to 110 years in prison. ,"The verdict came in less than five hours: guilty. Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the FTX cryptocurrency empire, which went bankrupt in November 2022, was found guilty on seven counts by a New York jury on Thursday, November 2, including fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. The 31-year-old former financial whiz, known for his black hair and Bermuda shorts, faces up to 110 years in prison. The sentence will be handed down later, on March 28, 2024, by federal judge Lewis Kaplan, in line with standard US practice.The trial, which opened in early October, went very badly for the entrepreneur, founder of a cryptocurrency exchange platform FTX, which was still valued at $26 billion (€24.5 billion) less than two years ago. First, Bankman-Fried appeared from prison, his bail having been revoked by the court this summer for his attempt to influence Caroline Ellison, his former girlfriend. She was the head of Alameda, the FTX subsidiary that orchestrated all the fraudulent speculation with FTX clients' funds from the Bahamas.The prosecutor got a guilty plea from Ellison, who testified against Bankman-Fried, and explained how she lived in terror during the months of fraud before the edifice collapsed. The lying and stealing had, in her words, left her in ""a constant state of dread."" Two other employees, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, also pleaded guilty and testified against their former boss. A childhood friend of Bankman-Fried and former FTX engineering director, Singh testified that he learned in September 2022 that Alameda had used $13 billion of FTX customer funds and was unable to repay them.Finally, Bankman-Fried took the risk of testifying at his own trial, which is not mandatory – defendants have the right to remain silent – and is even highly unusual. ""Bankman-Fried made the risky decision of testifying, and it does not appear to have helped him at all,"" wrote the New York Times on Thursday evening. Indeed, the defendant lost points when the prosecutor confronted him with the statements he was making in his heyday and the fraud orchestrated during that time. Refusing to admit blame or acknowledge his misdeeds, Bankman-Fried answered ""I don't remember"" more than 140 times to the prosecutor who was questioning him, according to a count by the New York Times. He said he had never cheated any customers but regretted not having implemented better risk management at FTX. ""We sure should have,"" he said.His lawyers tried to explain that their client was not the evil swindler described by legend, but a math nerd, overwhelmed by the new industry and the business he had been trying to create since 2019 in a new and chaotic universe. ""In the real world, unlike the movie world, things can get messy,"" his lawyer Mark Cohen assured the jury.",/en/pixels/
Macron backs French Youtuber's video game museum project,"    In a video published on Sunday, the French president said he was giving his support to the Tev project, from the Twitch channel IciJaponCorp. The online crowdfunding campaign has already raised over €1.7 million. ","""I simply wanted to give you my support and high endorsement for your video game museum project, an active museum, a living city,"" declared Emmanuel Macron in a video broadcast on the Twitch channel IciJaponCorp on Sunday, November 5. On the same day, the crowdfunding campaign was due to close for the Odyssée project, an initiative launched by the channel's host, video artist and entrepreneur Benoît Theveny (known by his pseudonym Tev) to create a video game museum in the town of Bussy-Saint-Georges, in the Paris region. At the time of the French president's speech, the fund, launched on September 20, had exceeded €1.7 million.This message to the channel's audience was aimed more broadly at the gaming community and industry professionals. In his video, Macron began by congratulating viewers of the IciJaponCorp channel for their ""mobilization,"" then went on to thank visitors to Paris Games Week (PGW), France's biggest video game trade show, which ran until Sunday in the capital. The two events were not linked, however, as PGW is organized by the industry's main representative of commercial interests, the Syndicat des Editeurs de Logiciel de Loisir.In his message, the president also paid tribute to French professionals in the sector, which represents ""thousands of jobs, 600 studios in our country, and remarkable schools."" The press release also put forward the e-sport sector, highlighting the recent reduction in VAT to 5.5% on competitive video game events. The measure was in the finance bill for 2024.The idea for a private video game museum has been championed for a number of months by Tev, a Youtuber who also runs a company based in Japan and France, specializing in e-commerce, tourism and communications. Back in February, he was keen to find a place to display the collection of video game-related objects belonging to another French entrepreneur, Ludovic Charles. Speaking to Le Monde, Charles said he owned more than 2,000 consoles and tens of thousands of game boxes and vintage computers, all of which could be added to the museum's collections.The two men accepted a proposal from the mayor of Bussy-Saint-Georges, a town some 30 kilometers east of Paris, to install their private museum within a real estate project dedicated to sports and entertainment activities. The initiators of the Odyssée project hope to create ""the largest video game museum in the world.""According to the local councilor in charge of the project who spoke with Le Monde, the plans for the building have yet to be defined and the building permit should be submitted in early 2024. Built by a real-estate developer, the museum will have its rent financed by revenues from a commercial space themed on Japanese culture, located on the same site, explained Charles. The money collected from internet users should only be used to pay for the decor of the exhibition space, he added.While there is currently no museum specializing in video games in France, a number of similar projects have been attempted but have failed to come to fruition or to survive. For example, the video game museum in Schiltigheim (in the eastern French region of Alsace) had to close its doors in 2020 and relocate to Belgium. Institutions, including the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (CNAM, National Conservatory of Arts ad Crafts) and the Institut National de Recherche en Sciences et Technologies du Numérique (INRIA, National Institute for Research in Science and Digital Technologies), as well as organizations, such as the Paris-based Mo5, are campaigning for a national public museum for computing and video games.The high patronage label granted to the Odyssée project by Macron is purely honorary and does not entail any material support. It does, however, lend credibility and media visibility to the project and reflects ""a mark of interest from the head of state,"" according to the Elysée. It can also help in the search for financing: ""We'll be there to make things easier for you, to support you, to see this project through to the end,"" said Macron in his message.With his endorsement, the French president was making a new commitment to the video game industry. In a message published on X on September 16, he admitted that he had made the gamers see red: He was talking about his statement from June 30, during the urban riots that followed the death of Nahel M, who was killed by a police officer during a traffic stop. At that time, he lamented that ""certain young people"" had become ""intoxicated"" by video games.",/en/pixels/
ChatGPT maker OpenAI announces customizable chatbots and enhanced AI models,    The San Francisco-based start-up presented its latest innovations on Monday while promising 'superpowers on demand' for all. ,"ChatGPT maker OpenAI on Monday, November 6, enticed developers with lower prices and the ability to easily tailor artificial intelligence ""agents"" to help with anything from laundry advice to contract negotiations. Dreams of the benefits of generative AI along with fears of the technology's risks have been hot topics in the tech world since ChatGPT made its blockbuster debut a year ago.""We will be able to do more; to create more, and to have more,"" Open AI chief executive Sam Altman told developers at the gathering in San Francisco. ""As intelligence is integrated everywhere, we will all have superpowers on demand."" More than two million developers are building on the OpenAI platform, while more than 100 million people use ChatGPT weekly, according to the San Francisco-based startup. ""About a year ago, November 30, we shipped ChatGPT as a low-key research preview,"" Altman said. ""That went pretty well,"" he quipped. The launch of ChatGPT ignited an AI race with contenders including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta.Altman has testified before US Congress about AI and spoken with heads of state about the technology. Pressure has ramped steadily to regulate AI to control for risks such as its use in bioweapons, misinformation and other threats. President Joe Biden issued an executive order just weeks ago on regulating artificial intelligence, aiming for the United States to ""lead the way"" in global efforts at managing the new technology's risks. The order directs federal agencies to set new safety standards for AI systems and requires developers to ""share their safety test results and other critical information with the US government,"" according to a White House statement. The world's first major summit on artificial AI safety took place last week in the UK with political and tech leaders discussing possible responses to the society-changing technology.Altman announced a ""Turbo"" version of OpenAI's leading software along with reduced pricing in moves that could fuel the spread of the technology. ""It's a smarter model,"" Altman said of ChatGPT Turbo. ""We decided to prioritize price first, but we're going to work on speed next."" OpenAI is rolling out the ability to create custom ""agents"" called ""GPTs"" capable of handling specific tasks, such as business negotiation advice, tips on removing stains from laundry, help with homework and tech support, it said in a blog post. ""Anyone can easily build their own GPT - no coding is required,"" OpenAI said. ""You can make them for yourself, just for your company's internal use, or for everyone.""Later this month, OpenAI will launch a GPT Store and plans to add a way for developers to make money based on how many people use their GPTs, according to the company. ""I'm really looking forward to Turbo and everything else that you have coming,"" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said after joining Altman on stage. ""We love you guys; you guys have built something magical."" Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and has woven the company's technology into offerings such as Bing.",/en/pixels/
Co-working giant WeWork files for bankruptcy,"    Once valued at $49 billion, WeWork has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a stunning fall for the office-sharing company once seen as a Wall Street darling that promised to change the way people went to work around the world. ","Beleaguered shared office giant WeWork, which has been in dire financial straits for years, announced on Monday, November 6, that it had filed for bankruptcy in a bid to negotiate down its debt. The coworking company said its bankruptcy impacts operations in the United States and Canada, but ""global operations are expected to continue as usual.""The bankruptcy filing was a stark turn of events for the New York-based company, which was once a startup darling promising to reshape the office sector globally. It at one point attracted huge infusions from investors, including SoftBank and venture capital firm Benchmark. WeWork was considered the most valuable US startup as recently as 2019, worth $49 billion.But elusive profitability, the rise of telecommuting, a drop in tenants and years of massive costs have hit the company hard. In early August, WeWork warned the US stock market regulator (SEC) that it feared for its survival: ""Substantial doubt exists about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.""Nonetheless, the company put a positive spin on the bankruptcy news. ""Now is the time for us to pull the future forward by aggressively addressing our legacy leases and dramatically improving our balance sheet,"" WeWork chief executive David Tolley said in a statement. ""We defined a new category of working, and these steps will enable us to remain the global leader in flexible work.""In practical terms, Chapter 11 proceedings enable a company to renegotiate its debt with creditors and present a plan to reorganize its business, while remaining under the protection of the law for a period that can extend over several years.WeWork hopes to negotiate a ""significant"" reduction in its debt. In particular, the group hopes to ""terminate the leases on a number of locations"" that are not making enough money, pointing out that the owner companies ""have received advance notice."" Ratings agency S&P said on November 1 that WeWork was in ""selective default"" after failing to meet conditions set by debt holders.WeWork had been a celebrated star in the sharing economy, laying down a mammoth footprint in the commercial real estate sectors of major cities around the globe. But investors tired of its messianic then-chief executive Adam Neumann, massive operating costs and lack of profits in 2019, when it tried to go public.The flamboyant Neumann, who started WeWork in 2010, was axed after the initial public offering failed. WeWork's slide only accelerated during the Coronavirus pandemic, which led to office closures and the rise of work from home.The company has scrambled to sell off part of its business, renegotiate leases and shut branches, but it still lost more than $1 billion in the first half of 2023.WeWork's downfall also severely destabilized the Japanese SoftBank Group and its Vision Fund, which had invested heavily in the company, thereby denting the visionary image of its CEO, Masayoshi Son.WeWork eventually did go public in 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company. WeWork's shares were worth just 80 cents at the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday evening, for a market capitalization of $44.5 million.",/en/pixels/
Stars of David graffiti in Paris: Russian interference suspected,    French intelligence services believe the act was commissioned by the Moldovan businessman Anatolii Prizenko. Images were widely shared by the 'Doppelgänger' pro-Russian propaganda network. ,"Four Moldovan nationals are strongly suspected of being behind some of the 250 Star of David tags found on walls in Paris and its suburbs over the past 10 days. One couple was arrested on October 27, another is on the run. French intelligence agencies now firmly believe it was an external attempt at destabilization. In a press release issued on Tuesday, November 7, the Paris prosecutor said that the examination of telephone data ""suggests that the two pairs of perpetrators were in touch with the same third person."" The prosecutor also stated that ""at this stage, it cannot be ruled out that the marking of the blue Stars of David in the Paris region was carried out at the express request of a person living abroad."" The investigation has now been handed to an investigating magistrate.Le Monde's analysis, confirmed by two independent experts, finds that the operation was exploited by the ""Doppelgänger"" network, also known as RRN (for Reliable Recent News). On October 28, a large number of accounts affiliated with this network started sharing on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook two photos of the blue tags on the walls of a building on Rue de Rocroy, in Paris's 10th arrondissement. The vandalism from that night led to the arrest of a couple of Moldovan nationals, aged 28 and 33.The RRN propaganda infrastructure – which, in addition to bots publishing large quantities of messages on social media, also runs fake news sites in French and has previously created fake copies of major news websites (including Le Monde) – had been publicly denounced by the French government on June 13. In a rare statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry had attributed the disinformation operation to Russia, seeing it as ""a new illustration of the hybrid strategy that Russia is implementing to undermine the conditions for a peaceful democratic debate and thus undermine our democratic institutions.""The photos of Star of David tags posted by accounts linked to the ""Doppelgänger"" network don't appear to have been published by anyone else. They were not published by any news media and Le Monde has not been able to find any other source for them on social media. In the meantime, the Moldovan couple was arrested. Preliminary findings from investigators suggest that, following the principle of compartmentalization of any clandestine action, a third party was tasked with capturing photographs of the tags. These images were then sent to the operation's sponsor as evidence of mission completion, enabling them to share them online.",/en/pixels/
Quantum computers: French start-up Quandela raises €50 million,"    This funding, which comes less than a year after the $100 million raised by its competitor Pasqal, illustrates the advances made by this technology. ","The promise of quantum computing is increasingly reflected in the figures. Quandela, one of the French start-ups involved in the manufacture of these new-generation supercomputers, announced on Tuesday, November 7, that it had secured €50 million in funding. The new funds come in addition to the first €15 million raised in 2021. This amount, which makes the deal one of the year's 15 largest rounds of funding for a French start-up, confirms the growing appeal of quantum computing to investors. In January, Pasqal, one of Quandela's competitors, raised €100 million for its second funding round just a year and a half after an initial round of €25 million.Of this amount, €9.5 million, from the ""First Factory"" initiative of the France 2030 state investment plan, will pay for the Quandela factory in Massy (in the Paris region), inaugurated in June, from which Europe's very first quantum computer has just been delivered to a private industrial customer. It has been installed in a data center belonging to the French OVHcloud group, which can then rent out its computing capacity to its own customers.The balance of €50 million was paid by Quandela's four historical shareholders: Bpifrance and the Quantonation, Omnes and Serena funds. Crédit Mutuel Innovation took advantage of the transaction to acquire a stake in Quandela. Lastly, Europe, through the European Innovation Council fund, made a contribution, ""giving Quandela an international dimension,"" according to Niccolo Somaschi, one of Quandela's three founders and current chief technology officer.In addition to financing the ramp-up of production at the Massy plant (Quandela plans to assemble three new machines in 2024), the aim of this second round of funding since the company was founded in 2017 is also to give it a foothold abroad, in countries like South Korea and Canada, where national quantum plans have been launched.Subsequently, Quandela is not ruling out options in the United States. ""The entry barrier there is high but we think there's one trick left to play. We're going to start working on a dedicated strategy,"" explained Somaschi. In his opinion ""France has a high-quality quantum ecosystem, with excellent researchers and entrepreneurs. We shouldn't have any complications."" The international aura of Alain Aspect, winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on quantum physics, also lends credibility to French expertise in this field. He is one of the co-founders of Pasqal and a member of Quandela's scientific advisory board.",/en/pixels/
Hollywood actors and studios reach tentative deal to end strike,    The Screen Actors Guild called off its 118-day strike from midnight on Thursday after finally reaching an agreement with the likes of Disney and Netflix for a new contract including higher pay and protections against the use of AI. ,"Hollywood actors and studios reached a tentative deal on Wednesday, November 8, to end a months-long strike that has crippled the entertainment industry, delayed hundreds of popular shows and films, and cost billions to the US economy.The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) called off its 118-day strike from midnight after finally reaching an agreement with the likes of Disney and Netflix for a new contract including higher pay and protections against the use of artificial intelligence.The announcement paves the way for actors to head back to movie sets, an end to picket lines outside studios and a return to employment for thousands of other jobs linked to the entertainment industry. ""In a unanimous vote this afternoon, the SAG-AFTRA TV/Theatrical Committee approved a tentative agreement (...) bringing an end to the 118-day strike,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement.In a message sent to union members, negotiators said the contract was valued at more than $1 billion and would enable members ""to build sustainable careers.""The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, said it was ""pleased"" to have reached a deal, and trumpeted a ""brand new residual for streaming programs,"" without offering details. Residuals are long-term payments for shows after their initial release. The deal still needs to be ratified. That process could take weeks, but the agreement is widely expected to pass.Talks between the two sides had taken place almost daily for the past two weeks, with CEOs of studios including Disney, Netflix, Warner and Universal often attending personally, as the clamor for a deal grew. Given the duration of the strike, studios already face gaping holes in their release schedules for next year and beyond, while many actors have been forced to find second jobs or quit the business.The news spread instantly across Hollywood, with celebrities expressing joy and relief. ""Incredible! I'm so happy we were all able to come to an agreement. Let's get back to work! Let's go! I'm so stoked,"" Zac Efron told reporters at a premiere of The Iron Claw. ""Perseverance pays off!"" wrote Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis on Instagram.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass welcomed the ""fair agreement"" that had been reached, noting that the strikes had ""impacted millions in Los Angeles and throughout the country."" ""Now, we must lean in on local production to ensure that our entertainment industry rebounds stronger than ever and our economy is able to get back on its feet,"" she said in a statement.When SAG-AFTRA walked out in mid-July, Hollywood writers were also on strike, but they have since resolved their contract dispute.In resolving the standoff between actors and studios on Wednesday, both sides compromised on minimum pay, settling on an increase from the previous contract of around 8%. That is less than actors originally wanted but higher than writers obtained, and the biggest increase in decades. An improved bonus structure for starring in hit shows or films was also eventually agreed.The growth of streaming platforms, which typically pay minimal ""residuals"" when a hit show gets rewatched, has severely eroded actors' incomes. AI proved a major sticking point in the final stretch of negotiations, with talks often struggling to keep pace with the rapid advances in the technology.Actors fear AI could be used to clone their voices and likenesses, and wanted stricter rules about the compensation and consent studios would need to obtain than the companies were willing to give. Details of the deal will be published following a SAG-AFTRA board meeting to review the terms on Friday, the union said.",/en/pixels/
"EU launches investigation into YouTube, TikTok over child protection","    The European Union said it wanted to know what measures the video-sharing platforms have taken to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA), in particular regarding the risks posed to children's mental and physical health. ","The EU announced investigations on Thursday, November 9, into YouTube and TikTok to find out what action the US and Chinese-owned platforms are taking to ensure the safety of minors on their platforms.The European Commission said it had sent formal requests for information to TikTok and YouTube respectively, the first step in procedures launched under the EU's new law on digital content.The EU's executive arm said it wanted to know what measures the video-sharing platforms have taken to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA), especially regarding the risks posed to children's mental and physical health.The DSA is part of the European Union's powerful armory to bring big tech to heel, and demands that digital giants do more to counter the spread of illegal and harmful content as well as disinformation. Platforms face fines that can go up to 6% of global turnover for violations.TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is particularly popular with younger users, while YouTube is part of the Alphabet digital empire that includes Google. Both companies must respond by November 30.The EU's top tech enforcer, Thierry Breton, said in August that ""child protection will be an enforcement priority"" for the DSA. The law has also banned targeted advertising to minors aged 17 and under.The EU already launched probes into TikTok, X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook-parent Meta over disinformation following the October 7 Hamas attack in Israel.The DSA also demands tech behemoths do more to counter the spread of illegal goods. The commission on Monday announced it kickstarted an investigation into China's AliExpress over what actions it is taking to protect consumers online from illegal products, including fake medicines, as part of DSA compliance.The DSA came into force in August for 19 sites designated by the EU as ""very large"" platforms that have more than 45 million monthly active users, including Google Search, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Amazon and Apple's AppStore.Smaller digital firms will have to comply with the DSA from February next year, when EU member states will have set up national supervisory authorities.TikTok and YouTube are also among 22 services listed by the EU in September that face stricter curbs on how they do business under the DSA's sister law, the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Companies must fully comply with the DMA by March 2024.",/en/pixels/
'Phobos' ransomware: Two Russians arrested following a dozen attacks in France,"    The couple, arrested in Italy, is suspected of working with this group since at least 2020. Little known, Phobos has nonetheless affected 200 recorded victims throughout France. ","Three years since the start of a series of ransomware attacks, police operations have increased manifold. Ransomware is the name for any malicious tool used by hackers to paralyze computer networks and demand a ransom for their release. This time, France has managed to nab two suspects whose profiles are highly sought-after. A Russian couple living in Saint Petersburg were arrested at Milan airport this summer. The arrest was in connection with a European arrest warrant issued by the French authorities, Le Monde has learned from corroborating sources.The two suspects, a man and a woman in their 30s, are suspected of working on behalf of the Phobos ransomware group. They were brought before an investigating magistrate in Paris and indicted on October 27 on charges of fraudulent access, maintenance, obstruction and modification of an automated data processing system, extortion and aggravated money laundering as part of an organized group, and criminal conspiracy. Both have been placed in pre-trial detention.They are suspected of being so-called ""affiliates"" of the Phobos group, i.e. hackers recruited in certain chatrooms or forums, who rent the ransomware, penetrate their victims’ networks themselves and then share the ransom with the virus' developers. While it is always difficult to trace the perpetrators of this type of operation, in this case, investigators from the cybercrime unit of the Police Prefecture (BL2C) were first able, over the course of the year, to link several attacks committed on French territory to two actors with very similar methods. Then, thanks to cooperation with other international investigation services, they were able to identify these two people and issue a European arrest warrant.Analysis of cryptocurrency flows has linked the pair to at least 150 ransomware payments worldwide, including a dozen actions against French entities since 2020. Their victims in France include local government authorities and businesses. Analysis of the electronic material seized will reveal whether they were also working on behalf of other organizations.The Phobos group, named after the moniker given to its ransomware by IT security researchers, tends to fly under the radar. Unlike the big names in the cybercrime sector, who today tend to target large entities as a priority, its virus has generally been used to target small businesses, and the ransom amounts demanded are smaller, generally several thousand or tens of thousands of euros, according to our information.",/en/pixels/
Digital giants' AI domination already raises concerns,"    American digital firms Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have seized the lion's share of the AI market, raising the question of government regulation of this strategic sector. ","""Historically, we've seen that these moments of technological inflection points can be really important for injecting competition into the market. Right? If you have incumbents, one way to actually have competition is for there to be totally new technology that renders those incumbents obsolete. I think with AI [artificial intelligence], we are already hearing some concerns."" This observation was made on November 3 by Lina Khan, president of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the US competition agency, in an interview with Bloomberg Telvision, which had asked her about the risk of seeing the digital domination already established by Google, Microsoft, Meta (Facebook, Instagram), and Amazon replicated with AI.This issue also came up at the summit on the risks associated with AI organized by the UK at the beginning of November, though it was initially focused on the possibility of seeing software overcome human control or encourage the launch of cyber or biological attacks: ""We run the risk of seeing the dominance of a handful of private players over our economies and institutions further reinforced,"" warned Amba Kak, director of the AI Now Institute, an NGO that studies the social and ethical implications of AI. French digital affairs minister Jean-Noël Barrot voiced concern about the ""constitution of monopolies,"" while a letter signed by numerous researchers and startup directors warned of the ""concentration of power"" in AI.""The US government is rightly concerned with a fair and level playing field [...] Self preferencing will kill competition and destroy choice for the consumer,"" Garry Tan, head of Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, posted on X on November 4. This comment is reminiscent of the accusation that the digital giants have sometimes favored their own services on their search engines, mobile environments, e-commerce platforms, and so on.And yet the recent AI boom has seen the emergence of new actors and leaders, such as OpenAI, the creator of the chatbot ChatGPT, and Sam Altman, its 38-year-old CEO. But the startup is already closely linked to Microsoft, which has invested $11 billion (€10.3 billion) in it. A co-founder of OpenAI, businessman Elon Musk lamented in February that the project, conceived as a ""counterweight to Google,"" was now ""controlled by Microsoft.""If Altman sought out this heavyweight of the cloud – online services for businesses – it was to gain access to its enormous computing capacities needed for AI: Running ChatGPT was already costing $700,000 a day in February, according to the website SemiAnalysis. Another AI startup, Anthropic, has just accepted $4 billion in investment from Amazon and $2 billion from Google. Shareholders in OpenAI and Anthropic, the two multinational corporations also market their AI models to their customers.",/en/pixels/
Estonian education and research minister: 'AI is within our education system already',"    Since its independence, the smallest of the Baltic States has built up digital public services and continues to innovate in this field, explains Kristina Kallas. ","A pioneer in the digitization of government and public institutions, Estonia is now preparing its society for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. While visiting Paris in November, Estonia's minister of education and research, Kristina Kallas, told Le Monde about the strategy the Baltic country has been deploying in this area for the past 40 years. It started in 1990, after we regained our independence. We were basically facing the reality of we have to rebuild our country, rebuild our economy, rebuild a new political system and rebuild the governance structures. And I think like in every way in public sector, innovation happens when you take away money. That's when there came the understanding to let's use the most modern technologies to build our governance structures because that saves us a lot of money.We have calculated that at least 2% of state GDP is saved, which means that you have less government spending of the GDP due to the collective use of digital technologies. You have less bureaucracy, fewer procedures and fewer resources spent on not very productive work. Of course, it also meant that you have to have a very open-minded culture toward technology. This was the hardest part of the process.We did have quite heavy debates in society about whether this is safe and whether this is reasonable because the digital signature system requires that not only the government be digital, but the people need to have a digital identity. Eventually, I think the consensus was reached quite fast. People do trust that it's safe because it's protected, privacy is protected and it's cyber attack protected. We have been able to develop constantly further services. We have been able to do voting electronically [since 2005].It means that 99% of services that you need to communicate with the state in order to receive, you do it digitally through your digital identity. I do all my services online. I am 50 years old, almost. I have never filed taxes on paper ever in my life because the year 2000, when the electronic tax reporting system came, was also my entry into the labor market. It's pre-filled with the data. You need to just check it. It takes me usually 3 to 5 minutes.In the next phase that we're doing now with public services, we want to use personalized public services so that like with the tax declaration, if I log in, then for my purposes and for my information, it is already pre-filled. [For example], every time I go to ask for my mother's care services, I don't have to constantly fill it in. [I don't] have to go and start looking at what the state can offer me, but the state tells me. For example, you have a mother who needs 24-hour care, and we know that because that's what you have reported to us. So basically [I just have to go] on the phone and say, ""Yes, I need this service.""",/en/pixels/
"Content moderation: Key facts to learn from Facebook, Instagram, X and TikTok transparency reports","    Transparency reports, which have become mandatory since the DSA came into effect, reveal some of the inner workings of the major social media companies, including their number of human moderators, their error rates, and how quickly they comply with EU member states' requests. ","At the beginning of November, the major social media companies that hadn't already done so submitted their transparency reports for 2023, required for the first time by the European Union (EU) under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which came into effect at the end of August. In addition to general statistics on their services, such as the number of users, these documents give unprecedented insight into the resources dedicated by Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok, and others to the moderation of illegal, hateful, or fraudulent content.These reports should be treated and compared to one another with a grain of salt, as there are many methodological differences between the social media companies, the observation periods do not always correspond to the six months required by the EU, and, above all, a great deal of information is missing, with Snapchat's and YouTube's reports being the worst in terms of omissions.These files do, however, shed some light on the number of moderators responsible for deleting problematic posts. A comparison of the figures shows that TikTok, a social media company with a Chinese parent company, claims the highest number of moderators: Four times more than Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, which boasts the highest number of users in Europe.How can this discrepancy be explained? In its transparency report, the American-run Meta specifies that its workforce outside the EU includes other moderators capable, in the event of a peak in activity in the region, of intervening in English, French, or Spanish.Meta also highlights the efficiency of its artificial intelligence (AI) moderation tools, which TikTok does not emphasize. The rate of moderation automation is very high at Meta: At Facebook and Instagram, respectively, 94% and 98% of decisions are made by machines – far more than the 45% reported by TikTok.However, AI is not always effective compared to human moderation, as demonstrated by the revelations from the ""Facebook Files,"" internal Meta files released in 2021 by whistleblower Frances Haugen. In its transparency report, LinkedIn is also one of the few platforms to make the error rate of its automatic content deletion tools public: it is estimated at 10% for English-language publications, 30% for German, 37% for French, and 80% for Spanish.For their part, Snapchat and X have decided not to communicate their moderation staffing levels for Europe alone and to give global numbers instead. However, even on this scale, their teams are skeletal.",/en/pixels/
"Oregon, the beautiful mystery of the American West","    Stuck between the mountains and the Pacific Ocean, this little-known state has kept much of its wilderness. The fabulous scenery of its coast inspired the local writer Frank Herbert, creator of 'Dune.' ","An old joke has long circulated on the plains and mountains of the American Northwest. After the Oregon Trail was inaugurated, opening a passage through the Rocky Mountains, immigrants from the New World were faced with a curious dilemma when an (imaginary) sign appeared: to the left, California, with its promise of gold and sunshine; to the right, Oregon, with its more austere lands and rather humid climate. Legend has it that at this moment, only those who could not read turned right.As is often the case, this quip has a grain of truth: The people of the American Northwest have an inferiority complex toward their great neighbors in the South, the inhabitants of the Golden State. Indeed, few states have such tourist attractions as the beaches of Monterey, the giant redwoods of Yosemite National Park and the misty atmosphere of San Francisco Bay.Yet who needs these beauties when your state is home to natural treasures like Crater Lake, a stunning volcanic lake; Mount Hood, the snow-capped jewel of the Cascade Range; or Portland, a city often referred to as one of the most livable in the United States? Which state has more and better to offer than a coastline that has remained wild along the Pacific Ocean, from the rocks of Cannon Beach in the north to those of Gold Beach near the California border and to the stunning dune strip that stretches south from Florence?It was while visiting Dunes City, a massive tangle of wetlands and sandy hills, that Frank Herbert (1920-1986) was inspired to write his famous science fiction novel, Dune, published in 1965 in the United States and 1970 in France, before giving birth to two blockbuster films.Born in Tacoma, Washington, the future novelist spent part of his youth in Salem, Oregon's capital, and then in Portland. In 1957, the young journalist had come to the Florence area to study the movement of the dunes and the region's herbaceous plants. The article was never published, but his observations, research and also, it seems, his repeated experiments with ""magic mushrooms"" led to one of science fiction literature's most celebrated creations.The dunes ""could swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways,"" Frank Herbert is said to have written to a friend after his visit, impressed by the traces of the battle that he imagined having taken place there between men and nature, in what became the Oregon National Dunes Recreation Area.Before the arrival of European settlers, the Siuslaw, Coquille and Umpqua tribes had long lived here in the middle of Douglas fir forests, the great pride of Oregon, by adapting to these shifting dunes and the water that seeps in everywhere. Since then, these bodies of water have been channeled wherever possible. Large-scale fishing and logging have altered the landscapes, transformed the customs and caused the near disappearance of the beavers (another pride of Oregon, nicknamed the Beaver State) and salmons to stay away.",/en/travel/
Five stopover villages on the road to vacation in France,"    Forget the impersonal highway rest areas. On the road to vacation, it's time to make a real stopover in one of France's 73 stopover villages. ","What is a village étape (""stopover village"")? It is a town located less than 5 kilometers from a highway or a national road, but it is not always a village. Sometimes it is a small town with less than 5,000 inhabitants. Stopover villages (which can be found in the Routard guide Villages étapes) must offer shops and activities capable of properly welcoming travelers. There are currently 73 of them on 36 roads across nine regions and 31 departments.You can appreciate Beaufort cheese and street art ""at the same time."" The proof is in Moûtiers, which did not wait for the creation of the stopover village label in 1992 to see travelers passing through. The (small) capital of the Tarentaise valley was already an important stop on the Roman road that linked Milan to Vienna two millennia ago. Today, you can discover a path of monumental frescoes whose colors liven the walls of the houses. There are about 40 works with evocative titles: 'The Jam' in the Carrefour parking garage or 'Le Touriste' at Place de la Gare. A free app – St'art – and a leaflet available at the tourist office list them all. Whet your appetite on this urban hike and head to the Moûtiers Dairy Cooperative for a free visit with a presentation of a multitude of local products and, at the end, a cheese tasting.Was Nicolas Peyrac referring to his childhood village when he wrote his hit ""So Far Away From L.A.""? Possibly, because, to be honest, Saint-Brice-en-Coglès – simply known as ""cogle"" – is quite far away from everything! It is the gateway to Brittany for those who enter from the north, through the Coglais, an area that is not well known even by the Bretons themselves. However, located between Fougères and Mont-Saint-Michel, Saint-Brice-en-Coglès is worth a visit, in particular to discover the splendid Rocher-Portail château and its wonderful gardens on the edge of a pond and the Echelles stream. The massive granite structure was built between 1596 and 1617 on elegant square plans. This private property can be visited and has a certain ""je-ne-sais-quoi"" like the famous Downton Abbey house. The most enthusiastic may decide to stay overnight, when the château is lit up by candlelight, before a musical performance and the firework finale.Jarnac owes its notoriety to François Mitterrand, the local child who was born there in 1916, became the president of France in 1981 and has been resting there since 1996. You can visit his family home, which doubles as a museum where gifts received from his time at the Elysée Palace have been collected. The tomb in the Grand'Maisons cemetery attracts the curious and political pilgrims. Beyond this nostalgia, Jarnac reveals itself as a small town full of charm that is nicely nestled along the right bank of the Charente. The city of Cognac is 15 kilometers downstream, but major cognac houses are based in Jarnac, including Courvoisier, Hine and Delamain. At Courvoisier, you can visit the cellar and discover the secrets of cognac making before moving on to the tasting, which is of course forbidden to whoever is driving!",/en/travel/
Five French villages with a hundred shades of red,"    From the North to the South, some villages display a hundred shades of the same color, red. ","Whether they are medieval or more recent, French villages, from Roussillon to Cléry-sur-Somme through Meyssac, are adorned with red. From the ochre facades in Vaucluse to the sandstone in Correze and orange bricks in Picardy or Sologne, the many shades of red invite the visitor to explore these villages as colorful as they are contrasting, with reds ranging from deep blood red to coral to crimson.From ripe apricot to scarlet through vermilion: The facades of Roussillon (Vaucluse), adorned with light green shutters, display a wide range of colors that makes the village stand out from other Provencal localities, where dry stone dominates.Situated on a rocky spur between the Ventoux and the Luberon, the village, classified as one of the most beautiful in France, is the capital of ochre, a dye that has long been used by the manufacturing sector and is still an artists' favorite. In the Okhra eco-museum, an old factory where ochre was ""washed,"" an operation consisting of separating the sand from the pigment, visitors will discover the history of the material.Roussillon is the starting point for the Ochre Trail, a walk through a former quarry with a lunar-like appearance. The trail twists and turns between dark orange fairy chimneys, these large rock columns capped with a block contrast with the raw green of the pines and cypresses. A picture-postcard landscape.Clay and wood. The Solognots have built their houses from these forest resources. In Ligny-le-Ribault (Loiret), clay bricks are everywhere, lined up like Lego to form walls, piled up between the wooden sides, adorning the facades with decorative motifs or raising the door and window frames.The village, which was built around the Sologne castles, is even home to the last remaining artisanal brick factory in the region, the Tuilerie de Bretèche, founded in 1890. Its products, of various shapes and colors, are used to restore historical monuments throughout the region and beyond.Don't miss the town hall, a superb building cleverly decorated with different colored bricks. Those who love the countryside will enjoy the ""natural region, where life is good, between castles, hiking trails and birdsong,"" said Anne Gaborit, mayor of the village.On the Place aux Arceaux, in the center of the fortified town founded in the early 14th century, the sanguine color of the shutters, lintels, beams and wood paneling contrasts with the whiteness of the lime. The woodwork of La Bastide-Clairence (Pyrénées-Atlantiques) is believed to be, as in many Basque villages, ""stained with ox blood, an animal that symbolizes power,"" said Veronique Ruiz, head of the village tourist office. A beautiful legend that everyone is free to believe. The fact remains that the ""Basque red,"" used to paint the boats, is part of the Euscaran identity to the point that it adorns the flag.",/en/travel/
Dakhla: A windswept lagoon in Morocco,"    In the very south of Morocco, this immense expanse of salt water with its white sandy beaches is the ideal spot for kitesurfers. It is also a paradise for migratory birds. ","As you leave Dakhkla airport, don’t be taken in by the long, straight avenues typical of Moroccan urbanism from the 2000s. Because while the city emerges out of the dune ridge, it is the lagoon that makes Dakhla a grandiose site. A vast expanse of salt water located in the extreme south of Morocco, this curved ecological treasure, 37 kilometers long and almost 400 square kilometers in size, is a paradise for migratory birds, biodiversity in general and kitesurfing enthusiasts in particular.Dakhla is located in the Western Sahara, which is the subject of an unresolved international dispute. In 1976, after the departure of the former Spanish colonizer, a conflict arose between the Polisario Front (supported by Algeria) and Rabat, which claimed the ""Moroccanness"" of the region. A referendum on self-determination for the Western Sahara, considered by the United Nations as a ""non-self-governing territory,"" was promised by a 1991 Security Council resolution. But the vote never took place because of Moroccan opposition. Morocco now controls 80% of the area, while the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic has influence only on its eastern and southern margins (20%).Since 2005, the bay has been classified as a Ramsar site, a protected wetland of international importance. Between the Atlantic Ocean and the Sahara Desert, the lagoon is on the migratory route of birds between Africa and Europe. The pink flamingos have settled there, but the great cormorants of Morocco are only passing through, along with dozens of other species of sea birds.Under the surface of the water, on the ocean side, fishermen pull out groupers, sea bass and curlews. Surfcasting, fishing on foot from the shore ""in the wave,"" is practiced day and night. The peaceful tides and calm waters of the lagoon also make it a popular place for shellfish farming. The oysters of Dakhla, which look like our own special ones, are fat and subtle. They can be sampled everywhere, at hotel tables or outside the traps at Talha Mar, an oyster farm that also has a restaurant.The fiddler crab remains the most familiar resident of the lagoon. At the Dakhla Attitude Hotel, the muddy areas where these crustaceans live are protected by signs that say ""Please do not walk on our homes."" The oversized claw that the males sport has become the hotel's logo.Ideal for kitesurfing, Dakhla Attitude is the oldest accommodation in the bay and the one with the most beautiful location on the lagoon. Its nautical base, now mythical in the kitesurfing community, offers all types of water sports, including the latest craze, wing foil. Like the other hotels at the bottom of the lagoon, Dakhla Attitude is largely reserved for those who ""kite"" or want to discover the sport, which is actually much easier than it seems. After a week and a dozen lessons, kitesurfing already offers a real sense of enjoyment, enough to choose – or not – to do it again.",/en/travel/

How to spend a weekend in London near St Pancras station,"    Impeccably located in the completely renovated King's Cross area, The Standard Hotel offers a brutalist cocoon for the style and event-loving traveler. ","For a long time, King's Cross was a transient area from where, confronted with fast-food restaurants and shabby hotels, people would flee as soon as they got off the Eurostar. But in the last few years, thanks to a revitalization project for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the area around St Pancras station has become a destination in itself. This change was made official by the opening of The Standard Hotel in 2019. It was the American chain's first establishment outside its country of origin, set up in a former annex of the Camden district town hall: a white brutalist building made up of alcoves and bay windows, with 266 rooms and dating back to 1974.In room 533, there is a striking visual gap between the interior with its '70s sci-fi atmosphere and the exterior, a bird's eye view of the St Pancras Chambers, a majestic brick building built by architect George Gilbert Scott in 1873 and which is now also a hotel. It's fun to observe the elegant, neo-Gothic lines, brick gables and convolutions of the building, as seen in the Harry Potter saga and the Spice Girls's ""Wannabe"" video, from the pristine modernist platform.If you get tired of the brick, you can head down to the library. Here, you can choose from books on sociology, philosophy or gardening, etc. Weekends in London are often boozy, so it is doubtful that phenomenology or landscape manuals are appropriate for the day after the party. Instead, it is better to go back to the futuristic cocoon of your room.The Standard Hotel, 10 Argyle Street. King of Kings room, from 400 euros per night. Lower price room, Cosy Core, from 266 euros. Eurostar, Paris-London round trip, 2 hours 17 minutes, from 93.50 euros.There's a line for the glass elevator, but the view on the ride is worth the wait. Once on the 10th floor, the vibe at Sweeties, The Standard Hotel's cocktail bar, is that of a shady 1970s nightclub: velvet sofas, leather booths, disco balls and even a giant penis sculpture around which guests pose at the end of the night. At the bar, mixologists Jack Sotti and Todd Austin have designed an amazing menu, with drinks like the ""Pick me up,"" made from vodka, cocoa butter, coffee and hallucinogenic mushrooms – the panoramic view of London just might find itself altered.Sweeties, 10 Argyle Street.The Beatles, Charlotte Brontë, Queen Victoria and Christopher Marlowe have little in common, except that they were all British. The British Library preserves the manuscripts of their songs, plays, poems, edicts, diaries etc. The institution's Treasure Room exhibits these paper documents that have left a mark on the country. With a staging of its own history as only the United Kingdom knows how to do, we go from one showcase to another, struck by the 1,000 facets of a national identity.",/en/travel/
"From Paris to London, by bike","    The London-Paris Avenue Verte allows you to go between the two capitals by bike in about 10 days, including the ferry crossing. From Auvers-sur-Oise to the white cliffs of the Seven Sisters, it's a trip that crosses sumptuous natural landscapes at low speed. ","Getting off of your bike seat in Trafalgar Square in the heart of London – 10 days after leaving from the square in front of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris – is the crazy challenge that more and more cyclists are taking up, most commonly with electric bikes. Called the London-Paris Avenue Verte (Greenway), the route covers 470 kilometers of road that is sometimes shared with cars but is mostly made up of greenways.Leaving Paris by bike for a long trip doesn't evoke the same emotions as riding in the capital from one district to another: You have the feeling of escaping, of breaking away. On the Saint-Denis Canal, when the quai de la Charente becomes the quai de l'Allier, Paris was behind us. We rode on the ""Street Art Avenue,"" an urban art trail that links Paris to the Saint-Denis train station. If you choose to go to Maisons-Laffitte by the banks of the Seine, this first stage of 45 kilometers – of which more than 32 kilometers is bike paths – takes three hours without going fast.But as the Saint-Denis basilica and its royal necropolis are on the way, some people want to take a picture in front of the chimera graffitied by the duo JeniAle at the Thiers footbridge. While others go under the RER B bridge in Aubervilliers, transfigured by the colors of the work of graffiti artist Roid. The journey time is a matter of choice between the goal and the thousand opportunities to stop along the way. We understood from the start that, if we have to be flexible, such a journey cannot be improvised.It all started with a rather demanding preparation – the equipment, choosing the route, booking the ferry and the accommodation – with multiple options to choose between a 100% bike adventure, a mix of bike and train and going alone, as a pair or in a group. But above all, the biggest question was to go with or without an accompanying vehicle, to carry the luggage, and why not have the cyclists and their two-wheelers on some parts of the route. Fortunately, there are a number of places to stay and repair shops with the ""Accueil Vélo"" label along the route.Two routes are available to cyclists when leaving the Ile-de-France: one is the longer northern route, which passes through the wonderful streets of Auvers-sur-Oise, its splendid castle, the moving tombs of Vincent and Theo Van Gogh and next the Royaumont Abbey. It then goes through Chantilly and Beauvais. The other is to the south, cutting through Chaussy and Gisors. Both meet in Forges-les-Eaux, the last stop before Dieppe and its breathtaking seafront, which is as straight as an arrow and lulled by the mineral sound of the surf wearing away the pebbles.",/en/travel/

Lufthansa negotiators and airport ground staff representatives were to meet again on Thursday, August 4, for a second day of discussions to try to reach an agreement on salary increases for 20,000 people directly employed by the German airline (LH Technik, LH Logistik, etc.) and its subsidiary Lufthansa Cargo.The Ver.di union is demanding a 9.5% pay increase and at least 350 euros more for salaries below 3,700 euros gross. Management is offering 150 euros a month now, an additional 100 euros in January 2023 and, if the group makes a profit, an additional 2% in a year. Another point of contention is the term of the agreement – employees would like to limit it to twelve months, to renegotiate if necessary in a year depending on inflation, while the company would like to lock it in for 18 months.This is the third time this summer that the two sides have attempted to get together. On July 27, the unions organized a strike that blocked more than a thousand flights. At boarding counters, in maintenance, in baggage handling, this 26-hour warning strike affected the vacation departures of 134,000 travelers. August and September are always the two most important months for the company. The stakes are high.On Wednesday morning, the employees were duly ""hopeful"" of a rapid ""breakthrough,"" in the words of the main Ver.di negotiator, Christine Behle. Particularly since the other companies that provide ground services at airports, whether competitors or subcontractors of Lufthansa such as Aviation Handling Services or Aviapartner, paved the way at the start of the week, signing an agreement with Ver.di for significant increases (between 17% and 26% in the next six months).""Given the willingness of smaller companies to raise wages, it is all the more surprising that Lufthansa refuses to do so, disappointing its employees and passengers in the middle of the vacation period,"" noted another Ver.di negotiator, Marvin Rechinsky. He is calling for more ""respect"" in general. This is a slogan on the union's banners in the lobby of the hotel where the negotiations are taking place at Frankfurt airport.Mr. Rechinsky emphasizes the extra workload on employees with the resumption of air traffic after the Covid-19 pandemic. The sector has had to cut back heavily since 2020. It is estimated that one in three jobs has been eliminated. According to a study by the Institute for the World Economy in Kiel, there is currently a shortage of 7,200 qualified employees at German airports. At the end of June, there was a one-kilometer queue for security checks at Cologne-Bonn airport.",/en/travel/
Saving Madeira's laurels from the stampede of mass tourism,Feature,"A sea of clouds crowned the jutting hills of the northern coast of Madeira Island that morning. On the misty heights of this archipelago, situated not very far from the African coast, the humid subtropical vegetation retains the water evaporated from the Atlantic Ocean. Some foliage of intense green laurels appears from the vapor now and then, driven by the trade winds. On the ground, thick tree heathers shroud the already narrow forest road.The sudden flight of a pair of trocaz pigeons with their blue plumage, a wild species endemic to the island, wakes up the hiker from his mediation in this gentle dampness. So this is what it means to be inside a living relic. The laurisilva, Madeira's lauriferous forest, is indeed a natural relic inherited from the Tertiary period. Several tens of millions of years ago, this primary vegetation covered southern Europe and North Africa.Although protected from the last glaciations by its oceanic climate, the Macaronesia archipelago (Madeira, Canary Islands, Azores and Cape Verde) has managed to preserve only remnants of this precious laurel forest. Listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999, Madeira's laurel forest is its largest surviving portion, covering 20% of the island's surface. In 1419, when Portuguese navigators landed there, they named the island ""Madeira"" (which means wood): ""The laurel at that time occupied almost the entire surface of the island. The colonization then gave rise to intense clearing for agriculture and wood exploitation. Fortunately, a precocious forest code prevented the disappearance of this native forest,"" said Helder Spinola, a biologist at the University of Madeira, who takes us into ""his"" forest.On entering the verdant park of Queimadas, 850 meters above sea level in the northeast of the island, the researcher is delighted at the sight of a healthy specimen. ""The laurel is a mother tree for me. It has always been there with me. It gives life to the forest, and shelters birds, insects and mosses. It plays a protective role for biodiversity,"" as he went on endlessly about his favorite tree with large dark green leaves and creamy-white flowers, that give off an exquisite scent. Since childhood, the laurisilva has been his playground. ""We often wandered there with my brothers. Once, we got lost in the middle of the night... What a fright we had,"" he recalled with a smile. ""Above all, I quickly understood that this lush nature was not just a simple forest.""The biologist arrived in Madeira in 1976. His parents had just fled the civil war in Mozambique, another Portuguese colony, where Helder had been born three years earlier. Back in their homeland, the Spinolas settled in the village of Santana, in the northeast of the island. They lived a modest existence in a small house with a thatched roof. At school, the children of these ""repatriates"" were not welcome. But the imposing laurel tree that grew right next to his house has a far greater effect on Helder than the taunts of his classmates. ""I was fascinated by the strength of this tree. Everything had changed around it in 50 years, houses had been destroyed, others built, roads and modern life had come, but this laurel tree had not moved.""The laurel is integral to the daily life of Madeirans. Its fragrant leaves are used in cooking, its wood for skewers and its berries for making oil for treating skin diseases. ""These trees existed well before humans arrived on the island, and their ability to regenerate never ceases to amaze me. See that mushroom growing along the trunk? That's the madre louro. It is rare to see it, it only grows on laurel trees and its presence is proof of the ecosystem's good health,"" the scientist explained. The parasitic fungus, whose shape resembles deer antlers, is an endemic species of Macaronesia.Besides the typical Madeira laurel (Laurus novocanariensis), there are three other species of the same Lauraceae family (til, vinhatico and barbusano) that coexist in the forest. As we enter the laurel forest, the path narrows down so much that it becomes difficult to pass other hikers. As we come out of a hairpin bend, we hear a gushing sound. What our ears imagined to be a waterfall, is actually a stream of water running down plant walls covered with green moss, all the way from the top. This shower of water droplets feeds the irrigation channels that the hiking trail follows.""They are levadas,"" said Mr. Spinola, wiping his glasses fogged by moisture. ""They are the result of an ingenious system that allows the island to never run short of water."" As early as the 16th century, the levadas were designed to carry water from the northern slopes, which receive more water, to the drier southern part of the island, where a majority of the population lives. The construction of these hydraulic works that cross the mountains was a perilous human adventure.On the northern side of the island, the fog is denser that morning. On the very touristic site of Fanal, cows are grazing in a clearing dotted with laurels. The passage of a mist makes this scene appear larger-than-life, which the tourists capture. A sight which does not please Mr. Spinola, who instead notices some weak-looking tree trunks on which only a few small green branches remain.""Laurel trees have the ability, at the base of their trunks, to develop shoots that will form young, strong trunks again, allowing the tree to survive,"" said Mr. Spinola. ""But here in Fanal, these new shoots are destroyed by cattle. There are other places on the island where cows can graze...,"" said the biologist, who has been an active member of Quercus (which means oak), a Portuguese environmental NGO, since he was 21.Concerned, he talks about the deceptive effect of the laurel and its evergreen foliage. ""This permanent spring gives the illusion that all is well. Yet our forest is under attack from all sides."" Further along the path, as he talks about the risk of fires, Mr. Spinola points out several human-introduced species that threaten the laurel forest, such as eucalyptus, acacia and ginger lily.Tourism is another danger looming over Madeira's lush greenery. That day, this problem makes it to the headline of the local edition of Diario de Noticias, featuring a rant"" from the island's guides, who criticize the overcrowding of hiking trails that run through the forest. ""We have already stalled a cable car project that would have brought even more tourists to the heart of the laurisilva. With all the existing levada trails, why concentrate tourists around the same spots?"" said Mr. Spinola. Lesser-known areas such as the Chao da Ribeira valley near Seixal offer beautiful hikes with ideal access to the laurisilva.His greatest fear is the imminent project to tar the road known as ""Ginjas,"" a dirt road opened in the 1980s that runs for 10 kilometers through the heart of the forest. ""We have managed to maintain the laurisilva in Madeira because we have not fragmented it too much. Keeping areas compact, so as to preserve them from tourism and pollution, allows the forest ecosystem to regenerate."" For this biologist campaigner, a relic is not destined to become a tourist attraction.",/en/travel/
Bask in the sunshine of Bormes-les-Mimosas,    Room 303 of the hotel Le Mirage offers a panoramic view of the Mediterranean coast and its lush landscape. ,"Located around 10 kilometers from the Fort de Brégançon – aka the summer residence of French presidents – the hotel Le Mirage was built in the 1970s. A young man from the Drôme department in southeastern France recently took over as manager – Jules Brenier, 27, who trained in hotel management at the Glion Institute in Montreux, Switzerland.Since his arrival, a breath of fresh air has been blowing through the corridors of this 35-room establishment, which he has completely renovated. Room 303 boasts a large white terrace with panoramic views of the pine forest, the hills and the Mediterranean.Touches of Sixties St TropezWe have a view over the water to the private island of Île d'Or. The song of cicadas enters the room through the patio doors. The decor is simple and calming – with a queen size bed, a small desk in light-coloured wood and a basket chair. Decorative touches evoke the spirit of St Tropez in the Sixties – a retro mirror, plates made of rope hanging on the walls, a raffia lamp...The restaurant menu has also been revamped. Sitting looking out to sea, a few meters from the palm-lined swimming pool, you can savor a ceviche of sea bream à la provençale with cherry tomatoes and black olives for lunch, and local yellowtail for dinner. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the medieval village of Bormes-les-Mimosas.A short walk to AustraliaDown the boulevard that winds its way toward the historic center, Gonzalez Park is an exotic botanical enclave in the land of the mimosa – a 3,000 square meter garden containing nearly 500 Australian plant species, including some rare species with geographically confusing names, such as the Chilean coconut tree or the Lebanon cedar. Guided tours by a gardener are organized by the tourist office, from May to September.A church in full bloomThe church of Saint-Trophyme, built in the 18th century, sits among traditional pink and ochre tiled houses. From May to November, the bougainvilleas that bloom on its façade give it the appearance of a Greek chapel. Classified as a historical monument in 1973, it has welcomed several French presidents during services, including Georges Pompidou and his wife, Claude.An island viewFrom the Place de l'Isclou-d'Amour, the view of the sea and the island of Porquerolles is dazzling. With its octagonal fountain, planted in the middle of hibiscus and mimosas, it is the ideal place for a breather – in Provençal, ""isclou"" means ""island."" In this small space, no fewer than 60 botanical varieties bloom throughout the seasons, including an imposing traveler's tree.",/en/travel/
"Glastonbury, the British town where druids commune with trees",Feature,"Near an old English abbey in ruins, a yew tree has stood the test of time, for over a thousand years. Sacred to the Celts, the yew is now a protected species in Great Britain. Majestic and imposing, this one has a trunk so thick that a gaping hole divides it from top to bottom. Its branches look like multiple twisted arms, as if ready scoop up the first passer-by. As we got closer, we were startled by a thud emanating from the tree. Moments later, a man emerged from the cavity of the giant conifer, looking sleepy. The wacky scene made the English druid Penny Billington smile: ""Ah yes, dozing off in the trees is not uncommon here! A lot of us share a very carnal relationship with the nature around us.""This is Glastonbury, a small town in the southwest of England, famous for its music festival, which attracts huge audiences every year. Hippies on their way back meander through the small stores of the main street that sell incense, precious stones, fantasy objects and esoteric books.""Glastonbury is sacred. When I first came here in the early 1970s, I was immediately drawn to the mystical force in the air,"" recalled the druid, wearing a big black hat and small glasses, walking stick in hand.This city in Somerset county is at the crossroads of various religions and spiritualities, from Christianity and paganism, to Druidism and witchcraft. Dion Fortune, occultist author and magician, used to call the town the ""English Jerusalem."" For many people, Glastonbury represents above all Avalon, the mythical island of Celtic tradition where the tomb of the legendary King Arthur is said to rest, not far from the 1000-year-old yew tree. Perched on Tor, a hill overlooking the town, the enigmatic St. Michael's Tower is a further source of local mythology. It is around this medieval monument that large druidic celebrations take place throughout the year. Officially recognized as a religion in Great Britain since 2010, the close-to-nature spiritual movement is currently experiencing a revival in Europe.Fifteen years ago, when it was time to retire from her career as an English teacher, Ms. Billington naturally moved to Glastonbury with her family. ""Free from my responsibilities, I was able to devote myself to my search for spirituality, and so I passed through the three stages of the druidic path, that of the bard, the ovate and finally the druid,"" said the woman who has since developed a close bond with trees.With its many groves blending into the urban landscape, Glastonbury looks like a forest town. But you have to get away from it, go all the way through the fields toward the nearby Tor hill to discover the magnificent Combe Hill Wood, populated by old oaks and majestic maples. It's where Ms. Billington comes to revive her druidic inspiration.""I have several tree friends there. I know them well. They recognize me too,"" the druid said. Treading the forest path, she greeted some alders, casually and loudly. ""It's known that the ancient druids had a deep love for nature, trees and plants. They paid heed to their teachings and secrets,"" she added. ""The forest was a place full of life and contemplation, where they practiced meditation and performed ceremonies and celebrations. With such a strong connection to the plant world, they were trailblazers.""In the darkness of the wood, the druid remained silent for a long while and slowed her pace. She listened to the birdsong, which was in full swing that morning. Ms. Billington then took a pink paper bag out of her pocket that we thought would be filled with candy. She pulled out raisins and small seeds: ""You should never come to the forest empty-handed. It's a way to show our gratitude."" A little further on, she sowed her offering at the foot of a beautiful oak tree. Ms. Billington caressed its bark, walked around its trunk while keeping a hand in contact with it and then leaned against the tree. ""Did you notice? The other trees circle around this oak,"" she pointed out. ""It's one of my favorite places.""It resembles the forest sanctuaries that Celtic druids created. ""They called them their sacred groves. In these circles of plants, one could find trees such as the alder, the yew, and also the birch, the oak, the hazel, the holly, the apple tree and the willow. Each of them has a precise meaning in druidic tradition. These groves played the role of temples or natural chapels of sorts; they were places of spiritual refuge,"" said Ms. Billington. She added that the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids (OBOD), of which she is a member, has launched programs to plant sacred groves throughout the world.The oak tree, which druids adore, remains the king of the forest. It is on its branches that the most precious mistletoe grows, the rare and mysterious plant attributed to have magical powers of protection and healing. Pliny the Elder, a Roman writer and naturalist of the first century AD, reports in his Natural History about a mistletoe-cutting ritual in sacred oak groves at the winter solstice, by a druid in white robes with a golden sickle. ""We keep this tradition alive. In my garden, mistletoe grows on a small apple tree. Its natural magic amazes me and I pluck it with great reverence; I know what's symbolic about it,"" said Ms. Billington.Not far from her ""friend"" the oak, the druid stopped to observe another tree trunk. It was dead and withered, but in the course of its final transformation, it had taken on a strangely animal form, that of a greyhound frozen on the run. Right behind, an old maple tree was moving in a frenzied motion. Yet on this sunny morning, no wind passed through Combe Hill Wood. We asked the druid about the ever-moving leafy tree. ""He just wants us to notice him. He's waving at us,"" she said with a knowing smile.Ms. Billington defends her habit of ""humanizing"" trees and also lends them a presence, a force of communication that is not visible to the naked eye. ""The druids have always considered them as living beings with a soul, whose energy could heal or transform humans. It's our society that has gradually moved away from nature. It's urgent for us to go back to druidic knowledge and recover this lost connection,"" she said.For her, connecting with the trees on a spiritual level is a long journey of sensory experiences. ""It's not something immediately palpable. You have to make your imagination work, dare to plunge into a state of semi-consciousness, be ready to receive the tree's energy and, to do that, you have to start a dialogue with it once it accepts you. A lot of training goes into it before you taste success,"" said the woman who regularly shares her practice with the uninitiated. At the end of this sensory and meditative journey in the forest, the druid even promises a reward: a meeting with a dryad, a nymph inherited from Greek mythology, a protector of the forests embodying the spirit of trees.Possibly hidden under the bark, dryads are shy creatures who rarely show themselves ""except to those who know how to see and hear them,"" the druid mischievously added. Sensing our disbelief, she starts off with more prosaic explanations: ""Interactions between humans and trees are common in the stories we tell our little ones. Besides, there are more forests than fairies in fairy tales; that's how important they are to our imagination. The dryads of Greek myths come from this dreamlike journey and they symbolize access to the trees' hidden knowledge."" A gateway to the wisdom of the woods opens up.",/en/travel/
Icelanders' reforestation efforts paint volcanic lava green,Feature,"Route One which runs from Reykjavik to the South of Iceland is a journey like no other. It's a succession of geothermal vents, lava deserts, glaciers and volcanoes which form a lunar-like landscape. It is home to some of the island's most famous volcanoes, such as Eyjafjallajökull, whose eruption in 2010 blocked a part of European airspace. The slightest flutters from its neighbor Hekla, one of the country's most active volcanoes, are also closely monitored.Over time, their ancient flow of lava has been covered by lichens and mosses, their intense green subdued by the purple of the Nootka lupine flowers. Fighting against the wind, elegant terns fly over the road at full speed. The highlight of the show are the sumptuous waterfalls rising from the volcanic heights, reinforcing the image of picture postcard.But another guest plays along with this Icelandic road trip. Nestling in the valleys at the foot of the glaciers, are small tree-filled spaces known as ""groves"" or ""forests."" They seem so rare and so fragile in this volcanic desert environment that you could almost say they were strewn here and there by mistake. On this southern part of Route One, around the Systrafoss waterfall, the village of Kirkjubæjarklaustur houses a small forest with the tallest trees in Iceland. Sitka spruces measure about 30 meters in height.Elín Anna Valdimarsdóttir lives right next to these tall trees, in the oldest house in the village, built in 1885. Every day she strides athletically along the steep paths of the forest which clings to the cliffside. ""My father was a farmer and was a part of the small community that planted these spruce trees in 1949,"" she said, emotionally. Over succulent smoked trout and homemade whipped cream, she proudly showed the old, yellowed family photos.Born in 1952, Ms. Valdimarsdóttir grew up with these trees. ""Well, they grew a little better than I did!"" she said, mocking her small stature. ""Icelandic forests are 'human' forests, in the sense that they are filled with the memory of those who planted them. They are not abandoned or disembodied spaces. Over time, they have become places of deep social significance,"" said Elisabeth Bernard, a young French anthropologist who works in the forestry sector in Iceland.First discovered by Viking expeditions, the island saw a population of Norwegian settlers take root for the first time on its territory between the years 870 and 930. At that time, forests occupied between 25 and 40% of Iceland. There were birches, willows, and in smaller numbers, rowan and aspen. But the intensive agricultural activities, and in particular the grazing of sheep, led to many wooded areas being destroyed. Later, the forests were used to provide firewood and to make charcoal. Icelandic trees, already put to the test by volcanic activity and harsh climate, were no longer able to regenerate. ""Deforestation had been so huge, over the past few millennia, that only 0.5% of Iceland's territory was covered by forests at the beginning of the 20th century,"" said Ms. Bernard.However, rare native birch forests have managed to survive over the centuries in several places on the island. Drumbabót, a site discovered in 2003 in the south of the country, is living proof of this. ""Following a flood, a forest of fossilized birch trees resurfaced here, and the rings of the trees [their growth rings] have allowed us to verify their long history, which dates back even further than the arrival of the first settlers,"" said Thorsteinn Jónsson, with a pipe in his mouth.He is one of the owners of the land on which Drumbabót is located. To get there, he needs to cross a river with his powerful 4X4, that allows access to this lunar landscape, hidden from tourists and not mentioned in guidebooks. There are tree stumps leaning at the same angle, buried for centuries under layers of sediment following a devastating glacial flood, around the years 822 or 823.At the beginning of the 20th century, finding their destroyed forests became an obsession for a small community of Icelanders. In 1907, the Icelandic Forestry Service (Skógræktin) was officially established. ""Across the island, voluntary forestry organizations were also formed during the same period. An umbrella organization, Skógræktarfélag Íslands, has represented them at the national level since 1930,"" Ms. Bernard said. She works in Reykjavik for this NGO, which has 7,500 members, or 2% of the Icelandic population.At the dawn of the 1950s, the first large-scale tree plantations began, with the native birch on top of the list. At the same time, imported Alaskan lupine came to play a valuable role in enriching the nutrient-poor and eroded Icelandic soil. But the species proved invasive. ""We have tried to find solutions to make our land green. We have diversified the tree species planted, and tried to work on multiple ways to help them grow better. It hasn't always worked, but we've gained experience,"" said Aðalsteinn Sigurgeirsson, deputy director of the Icelandic Forestry Service, while he inspected poplar cuttings in the Thjórsárdalur valley in southern Iceland.Sitting with his cup of coffee in a small wooden house belonging to Skógræktin, the expert admitted to feeling the soul of Elzéard Bouffier, ""in the face of this Icelandic landscape sometimes resistant to reforestation."" In the story of the lone shepherd written by Jean Giono, the character planted thousands of trees for years, in an arid region high up in Provence. Eventually, it gave rise to a forest and life all around it.With 2% of the island's current surface (re) forested, the work of Icelanders is beginning to pay off. By the year 2100, it is hoped that this level of coverage will reach 12%. Global warming and the trees' natural removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) has warded off any remaining reservations about this ""forced"" transformation of the Icelandic landscape.But perhaps the ultimate initiative is that of 30-year-old Daði Ólafsson on the Vestmann Islands, an archipelago popular with tourists, which is a 40-minute ferry ride off the coast of southern Ireland. There, he manages the amazing 28-hectare site called Hraunskógur, where young trees grow hidden in the cooled lava fields of the Eldfell volcano. ""Since 1999, we have been planting poplars, Sitka and Engelmann spruces and Alaskan willows,"" he said. The mixture of this black petrified lava, the green shades of the plantation and the Eldfell crater's red rock, lost in the clouds in the background, creates a breathtaking panorama.When this volcano erupted in 1973, it led to more than 5,000 people being evacuated. To save their island and its fishing port, the inhabitants tried to cool and deflect the lava by pouring tons of seawater at the tip of the flow. They succeeded. It is perhaps this resilience in the face of the violence of the elements that explains the courage and obstinacy of the Icelanders to revive their lost forests. Even in the middle of lava fields.",/en/travel/
Seaside weekends in France to make summer last a little longer,"    Vacations may already feel like a long time ago, but from Marseille to Saint-Malo, there is still a whiff of summer in the air. ","Strolls to the lighthouse, one last swim in a heavenly cove, impressive sculptures on the beach, fresh salads... summer doesn't have to be over just yet.Right in the center of Marseille, on the Cours Honoré-d'Estienne-d'Orves, you will find the Grandes Halles du Vieux-Port, which opened on July 15 this year. This cheerful market, where you can sample food on the spot, has the feel of a small village. From Coquillages Claude, a shellfish shop, to the Rôtisserie de la Garde and its steaming-hot roast chickens, to La Vallée du Liban, which reminds of the city's neighbors across the Mediterranean, these Grandes Halles are perfect for an Airbnb weekend of conviviality and generosity.From Thursday through Saturday, the doors stay open until 2 am (and midnight on other days). It's the perfect opportunity to see the changing face of Marseille, as well as the MuCEM exhibition, ""Pharaoh Superstars."" This explores why some of Egypt's ancient masters were more popular than others, and has been met with well-deserved success – on until October 17.At Saint-Malo, no two Route du Rhum races (held every four years) are the same. In advance of the legendary race's next start on November 6, the city and its port are already buzzing. The solo sailors, nicknamed the ""va-t-en-mer"" (""go to sea""), will have to reach Guadeloupe, 8,000 kilometers off the coast of Brittany, in an attempt to beat the record for the crossing. It currently stands at seven days, 14 hours, 21 minutes and 47 seconds, set by Francis Joyon in 2018.From October 25, the village will spill out onto the quays of Saint-Malo, potentially attracting more than 2 million visitors. They will come to admire the exceptional sailors who are taking part in the race, but also their boats. New in 2022, the ""Ultims"" – the giants of the seas – will join the rest of the fleet in the Vauban and Duguay-Trouin basins, all along the historic quays of the race, at the foot of Intra-Muros (the old town) and the Palais du Grand Large.It is a port without the sea – almost. This is the origin of the River Auray, a narrow, elongated and deep ria, which follows the rhythm of the Golfe du Morbihan's tides in Brittany, where its water flows. Located on the eastern bank of the river, Saint-Goustan is an old trading port built in the 17th century, which used to ship cereals and textiles. Today it is a small marina with its own unique charm. Benjamin Franklin made a stopover there in 1776, and a quay was named after him. While Saint Goustan is the patron saint of sailors and fishermen, you don't need to be a sailor to explore – and what's more, this can easily be done on foot. After tasting oysters in the harbor, you can set sail on the Indomptable. Aboard this training boat, you can take part in the maneuvers and feel a little like a sailor.",/en/travel/

Germany to introduce €49 nationwide transport pass,    The €49 ($48.50) transport ticket follows the successful €9 summer ticket the country implemented from June to August. ,"German officials cleared the way on Wednesday, November 4, for a public transport pass costing €49 ($48.50) per month that will be valid nationwide, a long-term follow-up to a super-cheap ticket that was available for three months this summer and proved wildly popular.Transport Minister Volker Wissing said representatives of the federal government and Germany's 16 states resolved financing questions at a meeting in Berlin. He said the new ""Deutschlandticket,"" or ""Germany ticket,"" will be introduced ""as quickly as technically possible,"" hopefully at the beginning of 2023.In June, July and August, Germany sold a ""9-euro ticket"" enabling people to use regional train, bus and tram networks across the country for only €9 a month. It was part of efforts to help combat inflation stoked by Russia's war in Ukraine, as well as encouraging people to switch to environmentally friendly public transport and reduce gasoline use.There were widespread calls for some kind of successor at a more sustainable cost. A major attraction was its validity on all of Germany's regional transport networks, each of which has myriad fare options that can be hard to navigate.The aim is for the new ticket to be paperless and available for a single month or as a rolling pass. Like its predecessor, it won’t be valid for intercity trains – though, with creativity and plenty of patience, it's possible to make long-distance journeys using regional trains.Germany’s federal government offered to subsidize the new ticket with €1.5 billion annually; states several weeks ago expressed a willingness to do the same, pending an agreement on federal funding for regional train services.Under Wednesday's agreement, that funding is being increased by €1 billion this year and will grow by 3% per year thereafter, Mr. Wissing said. That was short of multiple states' original ask. Hendrik Wuest, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, said it was the ""absolute minimum"" needed to keep up current services and some of his colleagues were even more critical.",/en/travel/
A winter vacation in Paris? Our top hotel picks across the city,Selection,"For those visiting the capital as tourists or for Parisians who fancy a change of district for a night, here is Le Monde's selection of 20 attractive and welcoming establishments.Less than five minutes' walk from the Comédie-Française, and just a little more from the Louvre Museum, the Hôtel Thérèse is housed in an 18th-century building on Rue Thérèse, named after Marie-Thérèse of Austria. Visitors dive into another era when they arrive. The atmosphere is one of muted charm, from the very long sofa in shades of beige streaked with light brown lines to the monumental carpet created to fit around the two pillars of the large living room, spiced with the blue of the armchairs and the green of the doors. In the 40 rooms – from 10 to 28 square meters – industrial style intrudes here and there, in the white and black bathrooms, in a subtly chic, even neoclassical version, where the falsely stained carpet reminds us of an artist's studio floor enameled with paint chips. To appreciate the calm of the place, go to the small library-like lounge on the first floor for tea time, available to all guests between 4:00 and 6:00 pm. The effervescent Place de l'Opéra, nearby, can wait.Tinah for ""This is not a hotel,"" and indeed! It is a initially a little difficult to locate it while strolling on Rue Réaumur, in the Montorgueil district. Only a plaque, at number 108, an impressive building from the end of the 19th century, indicates that here, on the 6th floor is, or rather hides, a hotel that has all the airs of a (very large) Parisian apartment of which only the rooms and the spacious entrance (used as a common space and for serving breakfast) have been kept. No need to look for reception, there isn't one! A code, sent 24 hours before their arrival, is given to guests to enter the building and their room. There are seven rooms – one of which is on the landing – and they all have a view of the rooftops. From 16 to 21 square meters, they are decorated in soft colors (cream walls, heavy beige curtains, light wood headboards) and, like a Parisian apartment, the floor is covered with a magnificent parquet. It is possible to have the whole hotel to yourself, just to feel at home in the heart of Paris.At Maison Saintonge, a four-star establishment with a creamy white facade punctuated with green thanks to the ivy falling from each window, the tone is set as soon as you enter. Stone floor, white beams on the ceiling, herbarium of dried flowers in frames on the wall, counter, round table and wooden bistro chairs: You feel (almost) at home (in the country), with the clear touch of the Marion Collard design studio. The same atmosphere can be found in the 22 rooms and suites, with their cozy and relaxing atmosphere and colorful floral bedspreads. Do you feel a sudden urge to snack? Guests and locals alike will find something to their liking on the first floor, in the gigantic display cabinet – hunted down in a flea market like the rest of the fixtures and fittings – where black tapenade, mini breadsticks and artichoke hearts are on offer, which can be enjoyed comfortably on the rattan-like sofa in the tiny – but everything small is charming – inner courtyard. A real bubble of tranquility in the heart of the very popular 3rd arrondissement, and you might find it very difficult to leave.",/en/travel/
Alaska presents a journey 'into the wild',Feature,"Utqiagvik city lies directly below the Arctic Circle, at the northernmost tip of Alaska. In late June, when the sun never sets, a handful of tourists gathered in the village square to share the whaling celebrations with the Inupiat inhabitants. The town has only one hotel called Top of the World; there is no road, and not a polar bear in sight on the melting ice pack – just a dive into the Arctic's icy waters (minus 4 degrees Celsius) as a rite of passage.Above all, there was a genuine feast celebrated with its indigenous inhabitants who shared their bowhead whale, hunted in the spring, in all its guises: raw, marinated and stewed. They danced and tossed each other into the air from a huge sealskin tarp. It was an extraordinarily authentic experience that does not smack of voyeurism or miserabilism, as is so often the case.The trip to Alaska, an American state three times the size of France, was an initiation into what is known the ""last frontier."" By comparison, Wyoming, with its bears and bison in Yellowstone Park, seems as tame as an English garden. This was an incursion ""into the wild"" following in the footsteps of Christopher McCandless, an ill-starred American, who at the age of 22, got lost when he forced his way some 40 kilometers through the mosquito-infested summer tundra.He had returned after a previous visit and met his death in 1992. Cut off at his back by the swollen glacial River Teklanika, he allegedly died from eating poisonous berries. His rusty green and white bus became a pilgrimage destination, so much so that a hiker drowned there in 2019. After which, in the spring of 2020, the vehicle was officially airlifted away and is now in the process of being turned into a museum exhibit at the University of Alaska Museum of the North, which admirably chronicles Alaska's history.Not far from the pilgrimage destination, hikers also make the trip to take in Mount Denali, North America's highest mountain peak (6 190 meters). But the vagaries of nature must be respected. In the Denali region, humans are barely tolerated. Private vehicles have been forbidden for decades. You can only travel on foot and camp, or by bus on an unpaved road.We crossed glacial rivers, swollen from melting glaciers, including the Teklanika, which had proved fatal to Chris McCandless. We walked the legendary hundred-kilometer trail to our destination and, on our arrival, we saw... a blanket of fog. Our guide then produced a photograph of the imposing Denali peak, which we had dreamed of seeing. But this is Alaska: Not everyone gets see Denali. Weather is always unpredictable and even more so, because the mountainside road, which collapsed in the summer of 2021, will remain closed until the National Park Service builds a bridge.a bridge.",/en/travel/
Japanese treatments and marine spas: Five relaxing stays in France to melt your stress away,Selection,"The Yonaguni Spa opened in 2020 on the wine route in Alsace (Eastern France), in the Parc Hôtel Obernai, a family hotel founded in the 1950s. Measuring over 2,500 m2, the architects from Constans and Siegrist have designed a space that's both ultra-contemporary and soothing, sometimes full of mystery, often full of light. Inspired by a Japanese legend – the underwater archaeological remains of Yonaguni – the 10 pools are variations on the theme of the duality of stone and water. The Onsen space is soothing, the Geyser pool energizes, and the Typhoon stimulates. The hotel's outdoor spaces, from the panoramic sauna to the bamboo grove and the Japanese tea house, look out over Obernai, a charming little medieval town situated at the foot of Mount Sainte-Odile.The eco-lodge and Instants d'Absolu spa located on the shores of Lake Pecher, in the Cantal region of central France, offers stays that combine personal reflection and rejuvenation. Located in the middle of the Auvergne Volcanoes Regional Natural Park, the spa offers yoga sessions facing the lake before breakfast, and star and moon-gazing after sunset. The star-gazing spa combines a stainless steel bathtub and chromotherapy music, which plays on vibrations, with a personalized offer of massages and guided meditations. At an altitude of more than 1,100 meters, the climate is very distinct: The snow and ice of the harsh winters give way to flowering meadows in spring. The new ""Le Guetteur de Lune"" (""Moonwatcher"") bedroom has been extended with a beautiful wooden terrace reaching out towards the lake − connection with the sky guaranteed!In Bénodet, on the tip of Finistère in western France, you'll find Relais Thalasso, a resort completely renovated and redesigned in 2019. Facing the sea, yet greener and more natural than other Breton resorts, Bénodet is the ideal place to find balance. The ""Body and Soul Break"", new for 2023, is particularly aimed at active urbanites who want to take a moment to press pause. Over four days, from Wednesday to Sunday, four daily treatments are offered to relieve the tensest bodies. They include etiotherapy, a little-known holistic therapy, which focuses on the interactions between thoughts, emotions, behavior and memory. And there is a ""Sea jeunesse extrême"" (""sea extreme youth"") treatment, whose name sounds as satisfying as the facial massage with vegetable taurine.",/en/travel/
Berlin airport cancels all flights over pay strike,"    The powerful Verdi union said it expected some 1,500 airport employees to take part in the walkout. ","All passenger flights were canceled at Berlin Brandenburg airport (BER) on Wednesday, January 25, as staff walked out in a dispute over higher pay.Some 300 flights were either scrapped or rescheduled, the airport said, affecting around 35,000 passengers.The day-long ""warning strike"" was called by the powerful Verdi union to ramp up pressure ahead of the next round of negotiations with bosses. The union said it expected some 1,500 airport employees to take part in the walkout.Verdi is pushing for a monthly salary increase of €500 ($440) over a 12-month period for ground crew.

A gourmet food hall revitalizes the Old Port of Marseille,    The Grandes Halles du Vieux-Port now boasts a market of artisans and producers specializing in Mediterranean gastronomy. ,"Over the years, the Cours d'Estienne-d'Orves, a vast pedestrian square in the heart of Marseille, had lost some of its luster, with afficionados preferring to frequent the bars and restaurants of nearby Rue Sainte, which climbs towards the Saint-Victor abbey. But three Marseillais ""minots"" as they are called, came up with the idea of a taste buds tingling gourmet food hall, in place of the old Buffalo Grill, which closed six years ago. ""Other than the Arnavaux market – a sort of Rungis – Marseille didn't have a covered food market,"" said Julien Fabre. ""For our perfect covered market, we called on our favorite artisans and put together a package offering delicacies from all over the Mediterranean.""Last summer, twelve food boutiques set up in a space of 2,000 square meters offering meals and snacks that can be eaten at the counter or on the spacious, open-air terrace. The decorator Olympe Zographos, inspired by the traditional pestle and mortar of Mediterranean cuisine, has dressed the area in Sardinian stone and olive wood or oak. In the morning, you can enjoy an espresso at the Bar Central, follozed by a plate of shawarma, hummus and tabouleh for lunch at La Vallée du Liban, which also operates on the Corniche Kennedy. La Serre, is a gourmet vegetarian boutique that offers, among other things, focaccia with dried tomato pesto and basil ricotta. The 500 Degrés pizzeria is extremely popular and boasts a huge, faceted oven made in Naples. And in Les Grandes Halles you will find tapas; a rotisserie; an Italian trattoria; a wine bar and ""we even have an oyster bar,"" the entrepreneur said. ""The oysters come from the Camargue or the Thau lagoon, which the oyster seller will open for you. And you can also order sea urchins or razor clams in parsley sauce.""And if the aromas in the Grandes Halles inspire you to cook at home, you only have to cross Rue Euthymènes overlooking the Old Port, to enter the market. ""Within the stone walls and 17th century structure of this former rope factory, you will find the best artisanal products: Coquillettes & Fusilli for fresh pasta; the Corsican grocer Ribella and the traiteur Raphael Chiappero, formerly a charcutier (pork specialist) in Aix-en-Provence.

Le Monde's top 20 destinations to visit in 2023,Selection,"Adorned with turquoise, emerald and sandy yellow, any picture of lake Bohinj is a postcard! In Slovenia, in the middle of the Julian Alps, this glacial lake offers landscapes that are constantly changing, from dawn to dusk, from winter to fall. It is necessary to escape into the surrounding hills, on foot, by bike or on horseback, to discover the breathtaking panoramic views before coming back down to bathe in the clear waters. The region confirms the strong identity of this small alpine country with the wooden agricultural dryers that Slovenia has made an emblem to the Triglav mountain, which, at 2,864 meters above sea level, was the highest point in former Yugoslavia. In the villages, beyond the baroque churches topped with onion-domed bell towers, impressive chalets welcome visitors as if they were at home.In Colombières-sur-Orb or in Mons-la-Trivalle, Mont Caroux is called ""the mountain of light."" It owes this unique, sparkling light to its rock, an ancient granite that has turned into gneiss composed of quartz crystals and mica sheets. It is a brightness that did not escape the Greek sailors: Mont Caroux provided excitement for them over 2,500 years ago. Its luster intrigues and fascinates those who walk on these paths or climb these cliffs. It is a mountain of wild stones, folds and needles – as its name indicates, Caroux meaning ""the stony one"" in Occitan – at the limit of the Cevennes and one hour away from the sea. In the same day, you can cross a pebbled, mineral landscape with the Espinouse mountains and the sea on the horizon, forests of scrubland, holm oaks and beeches and bathe in the pools of white and icy water of its gorges. It is a mysterious mountain, in the same way as time spent in these rough and secret landscapes.Welcome to the ""Hawaii of the North!"" The island of Tiree, the most remote of the Inner Hebrides, in Scotland, has earned this nickname because this 78-square-kilometer area at the end of the world, battered by the swell of the Atlantic Ocean, is a small paradise for surfers. The climate is rather mild and sunny, the white sand beaches endless and the Maze, a long bay near Kilkenneth, offers powerful waves as well as a point break worthy of a movie starring Keanu Reeves. Those who are reluctant to get on a surfboard can walk, cycle or ride through the large plains of short grass dotted with whitewashed or thatched houses. Stroll with all your senses activated, observe the many species of birds that stop here on their migratory route, or on the horizon, and catch a glimpse of the seals and sea lions basking in Balinoe Bay.",/en/travel/
Five winter walks by the sea in France,Selection,"Put on your boots and check your pedals, because walking or cycling in these touristy destinations in the summer is just as enjoyable in the winter, well wrapped up.How can you see what thousands of visitors never see, the other side of Mont-Saint-Michel? By putting on boots and walking around the village by the bay.Quicksand, water holes, changing weather, water releases... Because the risks are numerous and accidents frequent, it is better to opt for the two-hour guided walk. It will first take you close to the small Saint-Aubert chapel, which is reached after having waded through clay and climbed some rocks. Once on the beach, the guide will start walking through the water towards the open sea and the islet of Tombelaine (an ornithological reserve, where 130 species of birds live together).We follow him, incredulous of the (cold) water up to our knees. Then, after a few meters, we turn around to see the island in the light, spectacular. We can make out the sublime façade of the Merveille, the abbey's masterpiece, and the scriptorium, where the monks copied manuscripts. In the sunlight, the archangel St. Michel shines like never before. ""He also serves as a lightning rod for the village,"" says the guide, who explains the incredible landscape around us, as the rain suddenly falls: in the distance, the marshes and the sheep grazing in the salt meadows; at our feet, the current comes from all sides, for it is here that the rivers Couesnon, Sée and Sélune flow into the sea. ""Until the 1980s, we still fished up to a thousand salmon a year here!""Within a few minutes, a pink glow has lit up the sky, and the water has gone down. We walk through the sand slowly to avoid sinking. In the distance, we can already see the walkway, shuttle and the stream of tourists. So we stay a few moments more between earth and sea, in this breathtaking bay.At the foot of the Albères, the easternmost massif of the Pyrénées (southwestern France), the pretty town of Argelès-sur-Mer combines the charms of the big blue and the nearby mountains. We take the time to discover the red brick houses and river pebbles of this small town, the memorial dedicated to the Spanish Republican exiles of the Retirada, in 1939, before heading for the coast path. 32 kilometers that lead along the Vermeille coast to Cerbère, via Collioure.",/en/travel/
Aix-en-Provence: Oscar Niemeyer's new French pavilion lives among the art at Château La Coste,"    The Brazilian architect's pavilion, with its dazzling clarity, is one of the most successful milestones of the Bouches-du-Rhône winery's artistic journey. ","Ten years after Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012) was laid to rest in the Sao Joao Batista Cemetery in Rio de Janeiro, he has resurfaced in France, in the grounds of Château La Coste (Bouches-du-Rhône), near Aix-en-Provence. Nestled among the whimsical topography of this Provençal luxury Eden, bordered on both sides by rows of vines, a new pavilion has just been inaugurated, bearing the name of the great Carioca architect. It was designed by his agency, under the leadership of his partner, Jair Valera, based on drawings he made in 2010. Mr. Niemeyer was 102 years old at the time.The building is intended to host exhibitions, as well as concerts and conferences. All curves and points, it is unveiled at the bend in the trail of art and architecture that has made the La Coste estate famous since Patrick McKillen shaped it to his own ideas. This Irish billionaire has enlisted the talents of the world's greatest artists and architects to develop a who's who of open-air museums. The collection has grown steadily since it opened to the public in 2011, at the same time as he was upscaling his wine production and building a luxury hotel on site.Works by Richard Serra, Louise Bourgeois, Alexander Calder, Sophie Calle, Ai Weiwei and Franz West are now in dialogue with two large metal wine cellars designed by Jean Nouvel, three enigmatic pavilions created by Tadao Ando, a ramshackle auditorium by Frank Gehry, a mini-museum dug into the ground by Renzo Piano and a high-tech pavilion dreamt up by Richard Rogers, whose firecracker-orange metal structure seems to be floating in the middle of the trees. Only Mr. Niemeyer was missing from the list.Approached by Mr. McKillen in 2010, the architect from Brasilia came up with his designs quickly after choosing the site. And then he died, in 2012. Although its origins were somewhat laborious (mainly, the estate's management tells us, due to scheduling incompatibilities between Château La Coste and the Brazilian agency), his pavilion already stands out as one of the major milestones of the tour. From the valley where it is located, it emerges like an apparition, an asymmetrical structure of brilliant clarity, that makes you lose your mind. On one side, there is a perfectly transparent comma, bordered by a glass façade. This is the exhibition space, from which the works (such as the wool sculptures by British artist Annie Morris in this inaugural season), the visitors and the landscape merge in a fascinating interplay of perspectives.",/en/travel/
New online agencies promote low-carbon travel,"    Across social media, a handful of travel sites are trying to rekindle a love for train travel among those who prefer to fly. ","One man related in detail how he had reached Marrakech (Morocco) by train and then by ferry from the city of Nantes, in the process spinning the slightest hiccup into an adventure. Others told of their getaway to Sicily, showing photos taken in the berths of a train from Rome to Catania.These sorts of traveler testimonies have, since March, been championed on new travel-related websites across social media. The aim is to inspire and revive the ""impulse"" to travel by rail among those who have abandoned it in favor of the airplane. ""We didn't expect that the project would generate this much interest,"" said Chiara Pellas, 26, one of the co-founders of the site Mollow.Launched in March, the website attracted more than 60,000 visitors in a single month and has seen its community grow. ""There are more people who are willing than are needed,"" said Clémence Martin, who is among those interested in the concept and who noted ""the true eco-friendly resonance"" of a project whose purpose is to avoid 1 million tons of CO2 emissions within five years.Created in the wake of this venture, and following the same model, Hourrail! has also aroused significant curiosity, drawing more than 220,000 page views in a month and a half. ""On average, out of every 100 people who consult our site, eight will click on a link to buy a ticket,"" said Benjamin Martinie, 32, one of the creators.""This type of initiative essentially fulfills a demand from the generations born after the year 2000,"" said Jean-Pierre Mas, president of Entreprises du voyage (""Travel companies"" union). ""Behaviors are starting to change among the millennials. Some of them are demonstrating an inclination toward restraint and even avoidance when it comes to air travel,"" he said.Nonetheless, these inroads have still appeared to be tenuous in light of the current recovery in air travel, fueled by a desire to dispel the effects of Covid-19 lockdowns. According to the Business Travel Observatory, bookings for the period from May 1 to June 1 were up 42% on medium-haul and 48% on long-haul flights compared to the same period in 2022.Of course, many booking sites have existed for years. Among the best-known are SNCF Connect, Trainline, Kombo and Omio. And the InterRail pass, which allows its holder to travel on the European rail network (from four days to three months).Newcomers in the travel industry want to take things further, by suggesting itineraries tested out by travelers or taken, as Mollow has done, from the recent guide by NGO Greenpeace which suggests 41 ideas for eco-friendly trips throughout Europe. To ""change the paradigm,"" a traveler selects a trip according to the time they have and not the chosen destination, with price estimations, booking links for each step, comments on comfort, and the corresponding carbon footprint.",/en/travel/
Paris Air Show highlights search for more fuel-efficient aircraft,"    Before the arrival of carbon-neutral aircraft planned for 2050 at best, manufacturers are working on more frugal designs. Several concepts are being studied, from flying wings to biomimicry. ","The aircraft of the future, expected at best for the mid-2030s, is not just a technological and industrial challenge. It is also a political instrument for the entire industry. Planned to be carbon-neutral by 2050, especially if powered by hydrogen, it also has the task of greenwashing an industry criticized by environmentalists for its impact on the climate. Even though air transport accounts for less than 5% of the world's CO2 emissions, it is the sector that is singled out for criticism as a symbol of practices that should no longer exist.The problem is, the aircraft of the future isn't close to taking off soon. But with the prospect of aircraft powered by hydrogen engines that will emit only water vapor into the atmosphere, manufacturers such as Airbus, Boeing and Safran are hoping to make future passengers dream, so as to leave environmental concerns at bay for now.To produce this type of aircraft, Airbus intends to proceed in stages. First, it will build what it calls ""an ultra-economical aircraft,"" said Alain De Zotti, head of aircraft architecture and integration at Airbus. He wants the next aircraft to ""be a quantum leap in terms of efficiency,"" in particular, ""in terms of fuel consumption."" He added that this means ""using less carbon-intensive fuels,"" such as the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). These fuels are virtually impossible to find today and are six to seven times more expensive than kerosene.Still at the drawing board stage, Airbus is ""working on three major families of improvements"" for future aircraft, ""aerodynamic efficiency, low-carbon energies and improved air traffic flow."" Tomorrow's aircraft will be equipped with ""wider-span composite wings"" to improve airflow, lift and fuel efficiency. One of these aircraft will be equipped with wings so large that, on the ground, they will have to fold up to allow the aircraft to park at the airport.In the future, wings will not only be longer, but they will also have ""variable geometry"", said De Zotti. ""They will modify their shape according to the flight regime."" De Zotti calls them ""intelligent wings."" In flight, ""the camber of the wing will change to reduce aerodynamic drag."" It will also change shape ""to reduce lift in gusty winds, thereby reducing the forces on the wing,"" he explained. There would be an ""almost instantaneous modification"" of the wings, according to Airbus, which has announced that it is testing ""the first generation of these technologies on its long-haul A350.""",/en/travel/
Paris airport pandemonium after bag handler breaks,    A breakdown in luggage-sorting equipment at Orly airport meant many flights left late and without the luggage of their passengers on board. ,"With just one year to go before Paris hosts the Olympic Games one of the city's airports suffered an unprecedented breakdown on Thursday, August 3, that led to a mountain of luggage piling up and delayed flights.A breakdown in the luggage-sorting equipment at terminal four of Orly airport meant that baggage had to be handled by hand. That resulted in many flights leaving late and without the luggage of their passengers on board, according to the airport operator and airlines.The breakdown lasted from the start of operations in the morning until shortly before 7:00 pm.According to Marc Rochet, head of the French Bee and Air Caraibes airlines using the affected terminal, flights took off with delays between one and three hours – and without luggage that had been checked in. ""We didn't have another option, otherwise the whole system would be blocked,"" he told Agence France-Presse (AFP). Passengers' luggage would be flown onto them on the following flights.Airport operator ADP estimated 10,000 passengers on 40 flights were affected, but said that the reason for the breakdown had not been determined. The luggage in the terminal will be transferred to a secure hangar and then put on following flights. ADP tried to minimize the disruption by having planes use other terminals at Orly or use Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.Junior transport minister Clement Beaune called the situation ""unacceptable,"" coming just weeks after the government made a series of proposals to improve the quality of service ahead of the Olympic Games next year.

Five series that make you want to travel,Selection,"Watching a series can transport you far away: to Hawaii with The White Lotus or, a bit closer to home, to the snowy slopes of Haute-Savoie, following the footprints left in the snow by Piste Noire.When season 1 of The White Lotus (OCS) came out in 2021, the series immediately seemed like a postcard for Hawaii, and in particular for the Four Seasons hotel in Maui, the main plot location. But with season 2, shot in 2022 in Taormina, Sicily, at the San Domenico Palace − a Four Seasons hotel again − The White Lotus took on another dimension. Sicily itself became a character. From Noto's baroque churches, in the southeast of the island, to the Villa Tasca in Palermo (a small 16th century palace with a huge garden and a dream pool, available on Airbnb at more than €5,000 a night for eight people), all the luxurious places that director Mike White points his camera at are being taken by storm. The essential role of the gay characters in the plot has even inspired the Italian LGBTQ tour operator Quiiky Tours to create a custom tour. Even at a minimum of €2,500 a night, the San Domenico Palace is sold out for a long time to come!Can a series put a country on our travel bucket lists? That's what Sexify has done for Poland. A hit with audiences, the story about a student who is forced to explore a compelling topic – female sexuality – shows off Warsaw like never before. The main plot location, the student residence where she lives, is in fact a youth hostel, Kapsula, where you can sleep for €35 in 2-cubic-meter boxes, Japanese style. Located in the district of Srodmiescie Polnocne, dominated by the imposing Palace of Culture and Science, it anchors the action in the center of the Polish capital. In the evening, the city seems to be at peak hype: Although the nightclubs are fictitious – Heaven is not a trendy club, but a gay sauna – you can discover addresses like the restaurant Zoni with its metallic decoration, or the Praga district, with its bars and tagged walls. Sexify makes you want to take a springtime trip to Poland.Peaky Blinders has become a phenomenon for Birmingham, the large industrial city in the Midlands, about 200 kilometers northwest of London. The series created by Steven Knight 10 years ago is set in the inter-war period. The thugs of the Peaky Blinders gang enact their reign of terror in the working class districts of Birmingham, then get rich, while facing down Irish nationalists and the Italian Mafia. Rackets, trafficking, illegal gambling: What an advertisement for a city! And yet, with the series' huge success, the desire to discover Birmingham, with its recognizable canals, has only grown. The Peaky Blinders walk – designed by some watchful fans – explores iconic filming locations and the historical sites where the real gang was active, from the Rainbow Pub to the Burlington Hotel. Don't forget to watch all six seasons before the trip!Borgen, the Danish series that tells the story of a female politician's rise to the position of prime minister, has put Copenhagen in a new light. Far from the eternal Little Mermaid, the capital's emblematic statue, the action focuses on places of power, such as Christiansborg Castle, the seat of the Danish Parliament. The good restaurants of the series are real addresses, such as the Kayak Bar in season 4 where you can eat seafood before going on the water, paddle in hand. Other sites are hybrid: The exterior of the Italian restaurant Il Buco appears in season 3 as the headquarters of the new party founded by Birgitte Nyborg, the heroine of the series. Finally, the very recent season 4 transports us to th capital of Greenland, Nuuk, where the representatives of the autonomous Danish territory are based, and also to the more picturesque town of Ilulissat, with its beautiful colored houses.One, then two, then three corpses at altitude. Piste Noire is a crime series on French TV channel France 2. It was filmed in Morzine in the Alps during the winter of 2021-2022, and although the series is quite classic in style, it is also formidably effective. Led by an amazing duo – the actors Constance Labbé and Thibault de Montalembert – it takes advantage of the vast landscapes of Haute-Savoie in eastern France, and in particular the Joux-Verte Pass, which climbs from Morzine to Avoriaz. But by tackling the subject of the environmental impact of ski resorts head-on – and the luxurious real estate projects that accompany them – Piste Noire also gives us a different view of the mountains. The François-Baud footbridge is recognizable at a key moment in the action, and the river, the Dranse, is omnipresent. In the ski scenes, the slopes of Avoriaz have been enhanced. The series uses the fictionalized resort as a window to a natural landscape beautifully filmed by drone.",/en/travel/
"In Wales and Ireland, Celtic walks from shore to shore",Feature,"Both sides of St. George's Channel in Wales and Ireland share a disturbingly similar landscape. This Celtic stronghold is crisscrossed by paths where you can find no fewer than 20 remarkable lighthouses, dozens of medieval castles and almost 200 beaches of every size. You can walk along it in seven stages, catching tiny glimpses of a journey between nature and history.The county of Pembrokeshire (its English name; Sir Benfro in Welsh) occupies Wales' western tip, more than 150 kilometers from the capital, Cardiff. Nowhere are the carboniferous limestone cliffs as wild as in the south of the county, specifically around Pembroke. Saint-Govan chapel's parking lot – a little tricky to find – forms the starting point for the most extraordinary walk by the sea.The chapel dates from the 13th century (some buildings date as far back as the 6th century) and has the unique feature of completely blocking the steep path that descends between two cliffs to the shore. The place is extraordinary. You have to enter the tiny building to come out on the other side, facing the elements. There is no beach here, but blocks of stone whitened with foam and headlands which are home to colonies of birds. After climbing back up and walking for an hour westward on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path – the Welsh version of this coastal route – we find the splendid Green Bridge of Wales, a low arch beaten by giant waves.The Pentre Ifan megalith, 20 kilometers from the Fishguard ferry port, is at first striking by its apparent lightness. How could this 16-tonne cover slab have survived the centuries supported by three vertical stones more than two meters above the ground? Built 3,500 years before our era, this burial chamber is not the only dolmen in the beautiful Preseli Hills, in the west of Pembrokeshire. In this walker's paradise, Neolithic menhirs and standing stones spring up from the peatland like mushrooms. It is now known that the Stonehenge's megalithic bluestones, in England, were taken from Waun Mawn's standing stones, near Pentre Ifan, despite it being 270 kilometers away.Among the many walking routes, the Golden Road is the one that most deserves a visit. Starting from the Foel Eryr site, this 12-kilometer path going from west to east follows a route already well-trodden by prehistoric man, as they came and went from England or Ireland. The walk is enchanting, taking in Bronze Age burial cairns, ancient fortifications, flocks of sheep and heather.The ferry from the post-Brexit United Kingdom to the Republic of Ireland, which uses the euro, goes from Fishguard, Wales, to Rosslare, County Wexford. This is the narrowest part of St. George's Channel, with no more than 100 kilometers separating the two shores. The crossing takes the Stena Line ferries three and a half hours. In fine weather, you can can catch a brief glimpse of the shoreline, and it has to be said that the one we left behind is remarkably similar to the one we meet on the other side: The same high cliffs alternating with the same fine sandy beaches, whether small or large.The abundance of small museums is no small part of this Celtic stroll's charm. In Waterford, Ireland, the medieval museum tracing the history of Ireland’s oldest town since the Vikings is fascinating. Among other things, it exhibits the precious pages of the ""Waterford Charter Roll,"" a charter written by the Anglo-Normans in 1373, which features a portrait of King Edward III of England, the oldest representation of an English sovereign painted in their lifetime.From the Arklow Maritime Museum in Ireland to the charming Dylan Thomas Boathouse museum in the Laugharne Estuary in Wales, these tiny places with limited resources are nevertheless full of surprises. In Arklow, between sailor's knots and displays dedicated to shipwrecks, we find the famous woolen turtleneck sweater worn by local sailors. Very warm, it is unique in its lack of seams. You can take a guide – ""Knitting Instructions for Arklow Gansey"" – to knit yourself one of these truly authentic sweaters at home.We get to Hook Lighthouse in Ireland via a tiny road, with the distinct feeling of going to the end of the world. Built in the 13th century, the lighthouse is quite simply the oldest one in the world still in operation. Its main tower has four-meter-thick walls, an admirable vaulted room and a 19th-century lantern with a splendid view. At the foot of the lighthouse, there is a small café-cum-pub, located in the former keeper's lodgings. The lighthouse is a very popular and unique observation point at sunset.St David's Cathedral was built on the site of the monastery established in the 6th century by the patron saint of Wales. In the Middle Ages, it enjoyed such prestige that two pilgrimages here were worth the same as one pilgrimage to Rome. This church is one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture in Britain. Perfectly proportioned, it stands at the end of the village in a small valley. Many of the numerous Anglo-Norman castles have similar such ruins, making a trip to Wales a treat for medieval heritage lovers. Like Carew or Laugharne, the defensive forts were often built on the edge of the estuaries they protected. Today, the estuaries' calm waters hold a mirror up to the ruins, reflecting their former glory.The Irish and Welsh coastlines are not all dominated by hostile cliffs. Like the Normandy valleys of France, hollows lead out onto beaches. The largest and most accessible ones are crowded in the summer, but it is the small, sometimes tiny ones that give these Celtic shores their character.The Irish example is Dollar Bay. This small protected cove, seven kilometers from Hook Lighthouse, appears enchanting as you approach it via a path through the fields. Do those who enjoy sunbathing on its golden sands know that they may be lying on treasure? It was here in 1765 that the sailors on the Earl of Sandwich, a ship that came from Tenerife in the Canary Islands, threw their captain overboard to seize the Spanish gold coins that he kept in his cabin. The mutineers were caught and publicly hanged, and left part of their booty on the beach, which has since been named after them.Surrounded by fields, Pwllgwaelod beach in Wales is even more rural than its Irish little sister. You can rent kayaks, or simply swim there. While the hamlet of just three houses has all the appearance of a postcard, it is also because it leads to Dinas Island farm – via the Pembrokeshire Coast Path – which welcomes campers a long way from anything. Welsh or Irish, these magnificently cut coasts have one thing in common: From isthmuses to peninsulas, they grant a thousand magnificent landscapes if you are willing to get a little lost on their roads and paths.",/en/travel/
UK flights delayed and canceled as a 'technical issue' hits air traffic control,    Flight control operator National Air Traffic Services said its automated systems had experienced an unexplained 'technical issue' on Monday. ,"Thousands of air travelers around the world faced delays on Monday, August 28, after Britain's air traffic control system was hit by a breakdown that slowed takeoffs and landings across the UK. Flight control operator National Air Traffic Services said its automated systems had experienced an unexplained ""technical issue"" on Monday, August 28,  the end of a holiday weekend for many in the UK and one of the busiest travel days of the year.Several hours after the problem was first reported, NATS said the outage was ""affecting our ability to automatically process flight plans. Until our engineers have resolved this, flight plans are being input manually which means we cannot process them at the same volume.""The service said it had ""applied traffic flow restrictions to maintain safety"" but that UK airspace remained open. It did not give an estimate of how long it would take to fix the problem, or what had caused it, but European air traffic authority Eurocontrol warned of ""very high"" delays because of the ""flight data processing system failure"" in the UK.Airports both inside and outside the UK told passengers to expect delays and cancellations. Passengers scheduled to fly to Britain from European airports said they were being told to expect delays of several hours or more.Heathrow, Europe's busiest air hub, said ""national airspace issues"" were causing disruption to flights, and advised passengers to check with their airline. Aviation analyst Alastair Rosenschein, a former BA pilot, said the air traffic system appeared to have suffered ""some kind of patchy failure as opposed to a total shutdown.""He told Sky News that ""the disruption will be quite severe at some airports"" and some UK-bound flights will likely have to land in other European countries in order to reduce the flow of inbound planes.",/en/travel/
Is white wine cheese's new best friend?,"A red wine, especially if it is a tannic one, is never the best option for a cheese board. It is better to go for a white wine. Its floral, mineral or spicy notes have a better chance of marrying with the diversity of cooked, soft and blue-veined pressed cheeses.","The secret is out: Paired with cheese, white wine has largely taken its place alongside red. We have Alain Senderens to thank for, as the chef (who died in 2017) shook up food and wine couplings. This revolutionary was also the first, in 2006, to eliminate tablecloths from his famous restaurant Lucas Carton. By dissolving the marriage between red wine and Camembert, whose flavors had overpowered each other, he allowed for more peaceful pairings, though no less intense.Today, wine lovers will readily open a Savagnin, a Meursault or even a white Patrimonio to savor their comté or goat cheese. With a Chavignol, one would select a sancerre or even a white Mâcon. Even Champagne is now being paired with cheese, especially with Brie, which comes from the same region. While a red's tannins would overwhelm the soft cheese's fat and clash with its flowery rind, the white's bubbly momentum lifts it and prolongs the flavors.In fact, the variety of cheeses is such, that between blue-veined ones, washed rinds and pressed cheeses, white wine, thanks to its floral, mineral and spicy notes, supplies almost flawless matches, which is not the case with red wine, the consumption of which has been on a consistent decline.",/en/lifestyle/
Vegan beauty: Marketing ploy or real progress?,    The vegan cosmetics label is flourishing without the consumer always really understanding its meaning. All the more so as the sector struggles to do without certain animal-derived ingredients. ,"Although it's easy to imagine a dish of vegan food, the notion seems vaguer when it comes to cosmetics. And yet, the ""vegan"" indication on beauty products has continued to grow in recent years, up to the point that it's stealing the spotlight from ""organic"" and ""clean."" According to the 1951 definition from the Vegan Society, a British NGO, veganism is the doctrine that rejects all human exploitation of animals.In concrete terms, the only formulas that can be called vegan are those without any ingredients of animal origin and which ban animal testing. But there's a blurred area between self-proclaimed vegan brands without the specific label, those which display the sunflower logo of the Vegan Society or the ""cruelty-free and vegan"" rabbit of the international animal defense NGO PETA, and those which don't say anything but wouldn't harm a fly or any other animal.So, are vegan cosmetics a new marketing pitch or a real breakthrough? The answer is a bit of both. Regarding product composition, with plant-based and synthetic ingredients largely having taken the lead, the vast majority of cosmetics are actually vegan. ""Very few cosmetic products still contain ingredients of animal origin,"" said independent cosmetologist Lionel de Benettis. ""We're far from what I experienced when I started in the business, more than 40 years ago. Then, I was formulating with human placenta, horse serum and ovine embryonic extracts, among other things. What can still be found are beehive-derived products, marine collagen from fish and cochineal carmine, but increasingly rarely.""Cochineal red is a pigment obtained from crushed insects, and labs sometimes still struggle to create reds that stand out so well on lips. The American brand Hourglass reports that a tube of rouge requires 1,000 insects and that it has managed, after years of research, to develop a vegan substitute for the intense red shade Red 0 in its Unlocked Satin cream and Confession lipsticks. A patent is pending, and the brand plan to open it up to the entire cosmetics industry in order to spread this virtuous practice. French brands All Tigers, Pomponne and Le Rouge Français are also managing to free themselves from controversial carmine thanks to plants.Beehive-derived products are another animal-sourced area that's still widely used. Vegan organizations are targeting the methods used – especially industrial farming, which harms bees by confiscating all the honey (their food) and by brutalizing the community at each collection. For royal jelly, the queen's food, the situation is not much better. Some brands would therefore rather abandon these ingredients in order to avoid any criticism and satisfy an ever-increasing demand.",/en/lifestyle/
"Martha Stewart, 81, becomes oldest Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover model","    Since 1964, Sports Illustrated magazine has published an annual special issue featuring a swimsuit-clad celebrity on its cover. This year's ""swimsuit issue,"" an institution in the US, provokes much debate. ","At the dawn of the 1960s, the American weekly Sports Illustrated saw its sales decline at the start of each year, a slack period for sports news. In January 1964, publication director André Laguerre, a former Time Magazine correspondent in Europe, proposed replacing the traditional athlete on the cover with a model, Babette March, posing in a swimsuit on a beach in Yucatán, Mexico. Sales exploded so much that the ""swimsuit issue"" became, each winter, the biggest sales success of the year for the magazine, which became a monthly. From 2019 onwards, its publication has been moved to May, without hurting sales. Each of these editions constitutes a small media event.Over the years, one cover has followed another, featuring various models and women athletes. The choice of models has kept pace with changes in American society. In the early decades, all models were white. It was not until 1997 that a Black woman, model Tyra Banks, appeared on the cover. In 2020 it was the turn of a trans woman, model Valentina Sampaio. In 2021 an Asian tennis player, Naomi Osaka, was chosen. This year, the swimsuit issue features four covers, including one with Martha Stewart, a famous media personality, known for her television shows and magazines devoted to cooking and decoration.Stewart, 81, posed in a white one-piece swimsuit, with an orange tracksuit top. She has become the oldest model in the magazine's history, succeeding last year's model Maye Musk, Elon's mother, who was then 74. The media commented extensively on Stewart's presence, because of her fame due to her cookie recipes and her 2004 incarceration for insider trading, but also because of her age. On social media, many applauded the idea of an octogenarian striking suggestive poses and revealing her body, thereby taking a swipe at ageism. The New York Times spoke of a ""final brave gesture.""Some internet users and editorialists asserted Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue was no exception to its sexagenarian misogyny: Whatever the age, origin or background of the model; she is always photographed in a way that highlights a certain eroticism aimed at a predominantly male and heteronormative readership: Never has a man posed on the cover. But whether it is changing minds or reinforcing stereotypes, the swimsuit issue never ceases to provoke debate. In conservative states, many public libraries refuse to accept copies. Since 2007, to avoid offending its puritanical readers, Sports Illustrated has offered a subscription formula for all issues except this one, making the swimsuit issue, a metaphor for America.",/en/lifestyle/
Paris by bike: 10 sites to discover on two wheels,Selection,"It's a wide two-way path that runs into the heart of the capital, on the right bank. What more could cyclists want? Along Rue de Turbigo, in one afternoon, the history of Paname (one of the local names for Paris) can be savored piece by piece, from the 19th century to the Middle Ages, at ground level as well as from the top of monuments.We sometimes trod on its gray paving stones. For once, let's play, at Place de la République, before climbing into the saddle. L'R de Jeux, the space installed in 2015 around the old newsstand, claims to be the largest outdoor games library in France. Each year, more than 100,000 visitors come to try their hand at Connect 4 with their children, or at Backgammon with a complete stranger. Romain Guerreiro, games librarian and coordinator of L'R de Jeux, said, ""Those who stop by might be going out to a party, coming home from work or families. We even welcome those just wandering in, so we find a real social, cultural and intergenerational mix: Games are a great way to meet up!"" Whether it's board games, carnival games, games of skill or new games from festivals, more than 250 regularly renewed offerings await players, rain, hail or shine, or just about.Only a few rolls of the wheel away, you can contemplate the Carreau du Temple, a cultural spot full of life on weekends. Who knew that the majestic metal hall housed a haberdashery and second-hand clothes market in the 19th century, before becoming a training ground, from 1920, for tennis clubs and the French Sports Association for roller skating and hockey? Since its rehabilitation in 2014, you can play sports in the basement or enrich your mind under the preserved glass roofs, from art fairs to performances of all disciplines.It's time to fly down the two-way Rue de Turbigo. As cyclists know, you end up loving your bike as though it were a part of you. To get to know your ancestors better, nothing beats the formidable collection devoted to transportation at the Musée des Arts et Métiers (Museum of Arts and Trades). Here, for example, is the Michaux velocipede with a corrugated body, invented by the family of Parisian wheelwrights. At age 19 the son, Ernest, had the idea in the early 1860s to attach a pedal to the hub of the front wheel of a draisine balance bike. The machine, made of cast iron, nonetheless weighed 29 kilograms. ""The model worked! Moreover, until the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, France was at the forefront of velocipedics,"" explained scientific educator Cédric Mastellari.",/en/lifestyle/
"Tongoro, the Senegalese label that dresses Beyoncé and Naomi Campbell","    Launched in 2016 in Dakar, Tongoro, a brand prized by showbiz stars, is enjoying international success. Its creator, Sarah Diouf, promotes African know-how and hopes to inspire other designers on the continent. ","For Sarah Diouf, there is a before and after Beyoncé. Before 2018, Tongoro, launched two years earlier by the young woman, now 35, was moving forward leisurely as a young Senegalese label. And then, a first spotlight boosted the brand's sales: Beyoncé appeared in a Tongoro outfit while on vacation in Italy in 2018. Everything accelerated further with the release, at the end of July 2020, of the American star's feature-length musical Black Is King. In it, she appears wearing a black and white trouser ensemble, signed Tongoro, amid pink flamingos. Viewed more than 11 million times in two days, the film, broadcast on Disney+, further boosted brand awareness, resulting in increased orders and sales.Since this founding event, the queen of pop music has become a regular client of Tongoro. As such, her picture can be seen alongside those of American pianist and singer Alicia Keys and British supermodel Naomi Campbell in the lobby of an apartment in Scat Urbam, a modern building in Dakar, where the designer set up her office and workshop.If these VIP ambassadors quickly grew fond of the brand, it is because Diouf uses fashion, fabrics, cuts and volumes to tell the story of her continent. Her creations illustrate ""Africa on the move,"" which appeals to her most committed audience. It all started when, as a keen observing young woman then based in Paris, she sensed the wave of a still underlying African renaissance on which she felt she needed to surf, but her encounter with ""creative Dakar"" helped her refine her project.Born in Paris to a Senegalese-Central African mother and a Senegalese-Congolese father and raised in Côte d'Ivoire, the artist who defines herself as ""a child of Africa"" noticed in the early 2010s that ""the craze for African fabrics is reappropriating traditional cultures and sparking the emergence of contemporary African designers."" She found inspiration in this effervescence around Africa and its products, for this enthusiasm related to what comes from the continent. But it would take her many years to find her way.A communications specialist with a master's degree in marketing and communication management from Paris, she started her career in 2009 by creating a webzine named Ghubar, a ""space for the promotion of African and Arab artists in the world of art, culture and fashion."" In 2015, she followed up with Noir, a lifestyle magazine telling the story of African beauty and fashion design. It was through this back door that she entered the world of fashion.One thing led to another, and she slowly moved toward creating a brand Made in Africa, which she imagined as a vector for the continent's know-how. ""I've always wanted to embody African pride through high-value creations,"" said Diouf. She creates and directs a story that values sub-Saharan Africa through her collections. The fabric was an obvious choice for her, as fashion seemed the ideal vehicle for this narrative.In 2016, she moved to Dakar, where she was charmed by the omnipresent street tailors busy from dusk to dawn making made-to-measure clothes for all those ordering them. Diouf fed off this raw, ""fascinating"" talent, which she channeled for her label. She quickly surrounded herself with four tailors in her workshop supported by eight others outside. They produced between 100 and 200 pieces per month. The resulting production was composed of dresses with wide sleeves, oversized shoulders, and wide-legged suits, the flagship models of her collection. The pieces are designed to enhance movement and respect freedom of movement.Diouf based her visual identity around black and white prints reproducing flora or motifs from classic African iconography. Inspired by pictures taken by the ""fathers of African photography"" – the two Malian portrait artists Malick Sidibé (1936-2016) and Seydou Keïta (1923-2001) – this graphic design quickly became the DNA of Tongoro. This name means ""star"" in Sango, the language of the Central African Republic. Recently, at the request of her customers, Diouf broadened the chromatic range of her creations and the set of pieces she creates. In addition to the colors that vary in her basic fabrics, she adds head jewels and oversized earrings with highly stylized contours, highlighting a hairstyle and enhancing a head carriage. ""The cultural mix in which I grew up infuses my brand,"" said Diouf, who likes to emphasize in her outfits ""the presence of a subtle Senegalese poetry of volumes.""With Tongoro, she wants to give form to beautiful garments with an impeccable finish that she imagines being worn on her continent just as well as in America, Europe or the Middle East. Diouf who communicates in English – for the sake of efficiency – generates 60% of her sales in the United States, ahead of the United Kingdom and France. On the continent, her main markets are South Africa, where the brand is due to expand soon, and Nigeria, well ahead of Senegal, which is growing slowly.For her brand to be available everywhere, Diouf used her marketing skills and built her business on a digital model: All Tongoro creations are sold only on the brand's website. ""Why limit yourself to physical boutiques,"" she asked, knowing she could reach a wider audience of buyers on every continent. Since 2022, Tongoro has also been distributed on the luxury goods website Net-à-porter, a platform that has brought her a new Middle East-based clientele. Initially scheduled to begin in 2020, the collaboration was postponed for two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the brand's inability to produce two 1,000-piece collections per year.Expanding production remains a challenge in Senegal. Like other designers in the country, Diouf has had to train her tailors, particularly in pattern making. To gain autonomy and increase production to 500 pieces per month, she plans to set up a larger tailoring unit in Senegal. In the meantime, she is forging a partnership with a textile company already employing around 100 tailors based there. ""Because the sector lacks formalization, there is no fashion industry here, but rather an ecosystem to which we have to adapt,"" she said, saddened by this untapped potential. Yet Diouf is not giving up and hopes her journey will inspire other designers.",/en/lifestyle/
Five new hotels in Paris where your days will be as beautiful as your nights,Selection,"There are always new hotels popping up in Paris! We have selected five of them, all of which have a little extra soul: a breathtaking view of the zinc roofs, a trendy rooftop or a beautiful Art Deco bistro.Open since January, Le Bellune is ideally located for fans of trade shows, from the Agricultural Show to the Foire de Paris, which take place every year across the street at the Parc des Expositions, Porte de Versailles. Just a stone's throw from the metro station of the same name (line 12), and even closer to tramway stations (T3a), it is just as desirable for those who just prefer to explore Paris. No matter your preference, it will be a haven of calm and pleasure, with simple elegance starting in the lobby with its huge luminous bar, long sofas in leather or brown velvet, low black armchairs, (artificial) plants dangling from the ceiling, and a patio to get some fresh air or have a drink while admiring the wood-clad building.There are 105 rooms (ranging from 14 to 19 square meters) on 10 floors, some of which have balconies with a view of the Eiffel Tower or the Dôme de Paris-Palais des Sports and far beyond. Their khaki walls combined with the wood of the furniture have a soothing effect. But, before taking refuge in the room, care to try the house cocktail? The ""Bellune"" comes in a mocktail version (€10), with pineapple, passion fruit, cold hibiscus infusion, and organic agave syrup. It can be enjoyed along with a pinsa bianca (€16) with mozzarella from Naples, parmigiano reggiano, ricotta pugliese and gorgonzola. Or head to the pool – or the hot tub or the steam room, or all three – for an aquatic indulgence in the basement! Another oasis within an oasis.Less than ten minutes' walk from Notre Dame Cathedral, between the Odéon and Saint-Michel metro stations, there is now another kind of dame, La Dame des Arts, a four-star hotel, completely revamped and updated by designer Raphaël Navot. The hotel opened in early February. The nine floors of this 1950s building, with its registered historic windows with geometric accents, hold 109 rooms ranging from 15 to 32 square meters, including 31 with a balcony or terrace (on the sixth, seventh and eighth floors).In addition to the decor based on warm and relaxing tones and materials, each room has a collection of objects recalling the cultural and artistic exuberance of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. And, on the upper floors, ready your eyes as you walk through the door! The dark, muted ambiance of the hallways – your feet almost get lost in the thick carpeting – gives way to stunning luminosity and hypnotic views of the roofs of Paris. The view is even more impressive, of course, from the rooftop terrace, where the bar is open to all. The glass elevator that leads to this heavenly perch brings you face to face (or almost) with yet another ""lady,"" the iron one, the Eiffel Tower. Spectacular, breathtaking and dizzying, even if you skip the alcohol.",/en/lifestyle/
"Turquoise waters, green oases and majestic landscapes: A road trip in Baja California",Feature,"Baja California Sur was completely cut off from the American continent until the Transpeninsular Highway was completed in 1973, but it continues to be a world apart. It is the least populated state in Mexico, but also the one with the longest stretch of coastline and the highest percentage of land classified as a natural park. It's home to some bizarre plants, such as the elephant cactus and the datilillo: a bushy, disjointed yucca reminiscent of the Joshua tree. Its waters are so abundant in fish that explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau described the Sea of Cortés as ""the world's aquarium."" Thousands of gray and blue humpback whales spend their winters here.Taking a road trip in this desert between two seas is an American tradition dating back to the 1970s. As long as you avoid the tourist corridor and golf courses of Cabo San Lucas, it's almost like taking a trip back in time. It's also an adventure surrounded by nature. This six-leg, 500-kilometer loop around the southern tip of the peninsula, starting from Los Cabos Airport, takes you from the clear waters of the Gulf of California to the dark blue waves of the Pacific, via torrents, oases and valleys with 15-meter-high cacti.Most tourists landing at Los Cabos International Airport in San José del Cabo take the toll highway to Cabo San Lucas. You need to go in the opposite direction, via the Camino Cabo Este, towards Cabo Este, 45 kilometers away. After around 20 kilometers, the tarmac road gives way to a track with vultures circling above, which has a bad reputation with car rental companies. Don't be intimidated! The Camino is passable, provided you don't hurry. ""Bad roads, good people,"" as East Cape regulars say: bumpy roads, cool travelers.To the left is the desert. To the right, there are miles of empty beaches where the odd surfer in a van camps out. Occasionally, a humpback whale expels a jet of steam so close to shore that it can be seen from the road. We stopped to let cows and donkeys roam free past us. At night, surfers light campfires beneath the Milky Way. Devoid of asphalt, mobile coverage, big hotels, gas stations and vending machines, this coast still belongs to the adventurous.",/en/lifestyle/
2023: A new era for travel beckons,Editorial,"Is travel becoming a guilty pleasure? The climate crisis is prompting us to question our modes of consumption, leisure and escape even more. As early as 2020 in Le Monde's top travel destination list, we highlighted ten places you could reach without airplanes, encouraging our readers to discover closer to home. Since then, we have continued to evolve our approach to everyday travel, refocusing on the seemingly infinite beauty of France, promoting cycling, walking and train trips, and responding to the desire to get back to nature and disconnect.Once again this year, it seemed obvious to offer you a list of the best destinations in France (ten) and in Europe (five). But in order to travel ""responsibly,"" it is not enough to avoid flying. It is also essential to discover places that promote conscious travel. If the Lac du Bourget, in southeastern France, looks like a postcard with its turquoise waters surrounded by mountains, it's because people have been working for half a century to give this vulnerable environment back its oxygen and its fish. Behind the magnificent cultivation of olive trees, vines and almond trees on the terraces of La Balagne, Corsica's Garden of Eden, lies a fragile landscape to be preserved.An eternal dilemma arises: Should we reveal secret destinations or talk about those already popular? We chose... not to choose. Certainly, it is exhilarating to discover without the hordes of tourists the medieval charms of the Dropt valley, in southwestern France, to stroll along the maritime Flanders, from the river Aa to the other Sahara, or to take the wave on the island of Tiree, secret paradise for Scottish surfers. But geological splendors such as Meteora, the second most visited site in Greece after the Acropolis, are also worth a visit. It's just a matter of not playing Instagram tourists – staying long enough just to snap a photo – and taking the time to walk from Kalambaka to the incredible seven-century-old troglodyte monasteries.To dive into the clear waters of Lake Bohinj, the number one destination of the year, we advise avoiding the height of summer and making it a short stop for a few hours during a Slovenian road trip. In every season, the lights and landscapes of this glacial lake take on new colors, and you only have to go higher on a bike or a horse to come across breathtaking panoramas and villages that tell the identity of this small Alpine country.So many travel pleasures that a selfie will not be enough to immortalize.",/en/travel/
The unexpectedly delicious delights of tofu,This white soy-based paste from Asia is a popular meat substitute. Its taste may seem bland until the seasoning reveals all its subtlety.,"I'd just reached for my cell phone when a rumbling noise began to shake the very depths of my insides. The digital clock showed 11:30 am, I was hungry and, for once, it was my stomach rather than my brain that let me know. The previous evening's excesses – a pre-dinner drink that quickly degenerated into something rather more bacchanalian – led me to consider a light meal. The prospect of eating meat made me nauseous, but I still wanted something tasty. So, right away, I thought of tofu. I visualized a white, slightly shiny slab, that looked like a piece of feta cheese. I pictured it covered with a drizzle of dark soy sauce instead of olive oil, and lying on a bed of steaming rice, simply sprinkled with a handful of finely chopped scallions. For the first time in my life, this soft, white, soy-based paste, the epitome of various Asian cuisines and a staple of vegan diets, was giving me unbearable cravings.I questioned my prefrontal cortex: What exactly did I know about tofu? As my internal computer started updating, a few culinary memories emerged in superimposed snippets. Top of the list were the images and taste of this magnificent mapo tofu, which I enjoyed one winter evening at SuperMian, a small Chinese restaurant on Rue de Richelieu (Paris 2nd arrondissement). Beneath a fluorescent neon ceiling that made you think you had just landed on a street in old Shanghai, I greedily dipped my spoon into this emblematic dish of Szechuan cuisine. I found fresh tofu cubes by the dozen, cooked in a dense red sauce of chilli, Sichuan pepper and finely chopped pork. The tofu's lumpy texture was similar to sheep's curd or cottage cheese. When I first tasted tofu on its own, I remembered it tasted rather bland. And yet, it was only when combined with the other elements of the dish that the soybean paste emerged and acquired greater prominence, before serving as both a carrier and a binder.I was reminded of these words spoken by Japanese poet Ryoko Sekiguchi in an article in Le Monde, published in 2019 and devoted to the notion of blandness in gastronomy: ""In its French meaning, [it] seems very subjective, since, depending on the individual, 'bland' could be applied to all sorts of unrelated foods,"" explained Seiguchi in an essay entitled ""Bland."" This paper went on to tell us that, in Chinese and Japanese cuisine, the term ""bland"" was a neutral, refreshing flavor, linked to the purity of water and the quest for serenity. In tasting my tofu that evening, was I correct – or had I missed something?",/en/lifestyle/
Walk this way! Five themed hikes in the footsteps of bears and among vineyards,Selection,"Walk in the sea spray of Finistère, along the Hérault vineyards, or in the Buttes-Chaumont park in Paris and enjoy a little evening foraging, or even follow in the bear's footsteps in the Pyrenees.

Christophe de Hody suggests walks and hikes so you can discover the world of edible and medicinal plants and mushrooms in the wild.A herbalist, mycologist and botanist, he meets would-be foragers at the metro station exit before they delve into nature in small groups. But before starting to fill your basket, the enthusiast explains the basics: where to pick them, how to identify the good ones from the bad, which parts of the plant to choose and how to prepare them, whether in infusions, cookies, sauces or salads.There is a long list and no lack of edible plants. Depending on the season, you can find nettles that can be used in soups as well as eaten raw; ground ivy, which can be used to make a very good pesto; or even elderberries to turn into syrup, with a lychee flavor that is a world away from the ones you find in supermarkets. Any takers will quickly get a taste for this harvest of fresh nature that culminates in a picnic!Next, we're on the way to Digne-les-Bains and the Musée Gassendi, named after the scholar and humanist Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655), an aficionado of the arts and sciences who loved to watch the sky and nature. We start by browsing the museum's cabinets of curiosities, opened in 2002, before heading out into nature in the learned poet's footsteps.That's where the brilliant idea of a museum in the mountains came from: A collection of 160 works nestled in the heart of the Réserve Naturelle Géologique de Haute-Provence (geological nature reserve).At the origin of the Refuges d'Art project is British artist Andy Goldsworthy, who has resurrected the ruins of deserted villages to house artworks, comprising stone and clay sculptures. The 150-kilometer-long marked route allows you to explore them and to spend the night in the restored huts. Over time, new artists have continued to explore these landscapes and paths, such as Herman de Vries, whose gold leaf inscriptions engraved in the rock create an opportunity to look at nature differently.",/en/lifestyle/
Natalie Portman and Nicola Sirkis were a princely duo. Does anyone care?,"At PSG's final match of the season on June 3 at the Parc des Princes, the guest list had a number of surprises, including the American actress and the frontman of Indochine.","At the Parc des Princes, the show was elsewhere, so on Saturday, June 3, as PSG lost their final match of the season to Clermont Foot in front of a hostile crowd, it was once again to the grandstand that one had to turn. There, among the 250 guests in the former Corbeille du stade, now Le Carré, was an odd couple. On one side, there was actress Natalie Portman, just back from Cannes. On the other, there was Indochine frontman Nicola Sirkis, all hair as usual.That evening, Portman wore a firecracker of a lipstick. Glamorous? Well, lipstick has come to mean many things over the centuries. In ancient Egypt, it was a sign of belonging to the elite. In ancient Greece, it made you a prostitute. Much later, in the early 20th century, it became the feminist symbol of the suffragettes, then an accessory of resistance to Hitler, who hated it... But, in this instance, it was indeed glamorous.Portman also chose to hide her eyes behind a pair of cat-eye sunglasses. Inspired by the Harlequin masks traditionally worn during the Venice Carnival, this form of eyewear was invented by artist Altina Schinasi in the 1930s and became popular in the 1950s. A good choice? Not if you want to go unnoticed. If you did not want to be dazzled by the show in progress, you did not have to wear them. But to appear enigmatic and bewitching, yes, it was perfect.The Indochine singer, on the other hand, hid behind dark glasses that were far more innocuous. The attraction here was capillary, which gives us the opportunity to recall an old story. Back in the mid-1980s, Robert Smith, lead singer of The Cure, was convinced that Sirkis had stolen not only his musical style but also his haircut. So, as a guest on the pop culture series Les Enfants du Rock, he dressed up in a grandmotherly floral dress and justified his look as follows: ""Now we're going to see the guys from Indochine start wearing dresses and kill their careers before they're born.""Naturally, Sirkis did not wear a floral dress back then. More than 35 years later, it seems safe to assume that he never will, as is his classic taste. Take, for instance, this navy suit jacket worn over a navy polo shirt. The only extravagance here is the drawstring at the waist, characteristic of this new generation of drawstring pants, which promise absolute comfort, inspired by the style of pajamas. Surprising? Yes, but not enough to kill a career.",/en/lifestyle/
The thousand and one flavors of Israeli cuisine,Investigation,"About a decade ago, a book was published singing the praises of olive oil, burnt eggplant soup and stuffed artichokes. Jerusalem was a bestseller, bringing together two authors, chefs and buddies: Yotam Ottolenghi, from the Jewish part of the city, and Sami Tamimi, from the Palestinian part. Today, Ottolenghi heads a clutch of seven restaurants in London and has become one of the most popular chefs in the world. The publishing house Hachette claims that his books have sold 10 million copies and 500,000 in France alone (leading the list is the best-seller Simple, published in 2018).From books to TV shows, the British-Israeli has demonstrated that vegetables can stand on their own and has popularized ingredients that were previously rare in Western cupboards, such as zaatar (a spice blend made from thyme) and tahini (a creamy sesame-based condiment). His name has even become an adjective for fans who like to explain how to prepare ""Ottolenghi eggplant.""With the return of a seasonal approach to cooking, one might have thought that the craze for Israeli cuisine, full of sun-drenched ingredients, would deflate like a soufflé caught in the cold. Not so. Today, Ottolenghi's ""children"" have been carrying the torch, like Julien Sebbag, for whom the book Jerusalem remains a major source of inspiration.The young chef with a studied look, somewhere between a Christ-like figure and a rock devotee, has opened three new locations in recent months. At Micho, on Rue de Richelieu in Paris, Sebbag creates highly savory sandwiches using seasonal vegetables (currently artichokes and wild garlic pesto), priced between €13 and €16 each. At Forest, a chain in Marseille (Joliette district) and in Paris (at the Museum of Modern Art, Avenue du Président-Wilson), he has returned spurned items like broccoli crumbles back to the menu and created dishes widely derived from around the Mediterranean region.One has to look back at the creation of Miznon in 2013, a pioneering restaurant in Paris, to understand the Israeli fever. The street-food chain first set up shop a stone's throw from Rue des Rosiers, a mecca for Jewish cuisine in Paris, before also establishing locations on the Canal Saint-Martin and the Grand Boulevards. The menu in itself does not indicate anything revolutionary with its kebabs and falafel. But the kebabs are overflowing with lamb (€12.50) and the falafel has been piled into pitas stuffed with tomatoes, pickles and tahini (€10). The star of the show is a cauliflower, blanched and roasted before being drizzled with olive oil (€8).",/en/lifestyle/
Inside Alice Mitterrand's cabinet of curiosities,Profile,"Art galleries can be cold and intimidating, but one Paris gallery is an invitation to marvel. Whether your gaze falls on Kimiko Kitamura's colorful drawings or the porcelain legs of Maïssa Toulet's Miss Coquillage figurines, it's the smile that prevails. After opening her first gallery in Bastille in 2016, Alice Mitterrand, daughter of art dealer Jean-Gabriel Mitterrand and niece of the former culture minister, moved her enchanted little world across the river to Paris's Left Bank 18 months ago.A cabinet of curiosities awaits at this new address, where she continues to champion young artists, following a single rule: to offer poetic works, at affordable prices, with which she has fallen in love on each occasion. She quoted Anton Chekhov: ""Works of art fall into two categories, those I like and those I don't."" She added, ""I'm not an art theorist.""Far from a conceptual approach, Mitterrand prefers an immediate reading of creativity, as direct and accessible as possible. Perhaps it's a way of erasing a small childhood trauma. ""I was taken to see exhibitions every weekend. Every time I didn't like a work, I was made to understand that I was wrong not to appreciate such an important artist and a work I didn't understand.""Instinctively, Mitterrand wanted to speak to those who don't frequent the official art gallery circuit and to free herself from the sense of seriousness that often surrounds that milieu. ""In my gallery, I only present pieces that I like and that I understand, basically figurative works.""Her offering stands out in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés district, where you'll more often find classic antique shops and art galleries. In the structured disorder of her gallery, Mitterrand exhibits a dozen artists, a merry band whose profiles live mostly side by side. Many of them have passed through the Boulle and Duperré schools, and quite a few others are purely self-taught.Some of her protégés are now stars in the industry, sometimes aided by Instagram, such as Regards Coupables, an illustrator and graphic designer with an erotic universe; Monsieur Cailloux, with his characters from an imaginary planet; and Lorraine Sorlet, an illustrator who sketches intimate moments in a couple's life and now works for the prestigious magazine the New Yorker.Mitterand's own career path was an original one. After studying philosophy, she attended the Cours Florent and the École de la Rue Blanche to become an actress. Now a director and screenwriter, she has made four short films, including La Planète des femmes (""The Planet of Women""), a satire on gender codes selected at the Alpe d'Huez Film Festival in 2011. Unable to secure financing for her first feature film, she threw in the towel and began dreaming of a place she could run without depending on anyone else's fancies, where she could satisfy her taste for directing.",/en/lifestyle/
Five remarkable deserts to explore in Europe,Selection,"Do not necessarily think of sand dunes when you dream of these European landscapes. These areas are made of stones, covered with scrubland and gullies and adjoin the sea as well as summits. It's no mirage: They are indeed deserts.What do the spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, the French comedy La Folie des Grandeurs (Delusions of Grandeur) and the series Game of Thrones have in common? A natural setting. The Tabernas Desert in Spain is capable of giving the perfect illusion of the Sahara or the American West. The extreme aridity and infernal heat that reigns there between May and September invite you to discover the natural park in autumn or winter. Although the town of Tabernas, with its 4,000 inhabitants and whitewashed houses, typical of southern Andalusia, is alive and well, it is the gateway to entirely fictitious film villages, such as Mini Hollywood, which has become an amusement park. More striking is the walk along the PR-A 269 hiking trail, which plunges into splendid canyons, captured on film by Sergio Leone, and which immediately brings to mind the music of Ennio Morricone.Is a desert where dozens of freshwater springs gush out and which turns green every spring really a desert? Yes, if we are talking about the Agriates Desert, in the north of Corsica, which owes its current name to the English tourists who judged these former agricultural lands – empty of any population – to be deserted and gradually returned to scrubland by the rural exodus. Today, the 16,000 hectares of scrubland, which go from the sea to the mountains west of the village of Saint-Florent, remain preserved from recent construction, away from tarred roads. It is a paradise for hikers, on foot or on horseback. Above the splendid Ghignu beach, paillers – small agricultural dry stone constructions – have been set out as rather spartan refuges. Accessible by paths, these are the only places in Corsica where you can sleep far from everything, even in the middle of summer, for €12!Eleven kilometers of fine sand, with (almost) no one, even in summer, in one of the most beautiful regions of Portugal, the Algarve: The island of Barreta, nicknamed the Ilha Deserta, protects the lagoons of the Ria Formosa from the sea. A small boat makes the hourly crossing between Faro and this island at the end of the world, where you'll find Cabo de Santa Maria, the southernmost tip of Portugal, marked by a kind of driftwood porch built into the sand. The huge beach runs west from the pier, where the only building on the island is located. The Estaminé restaurant – designed to have zero environmental impact – has a terrace facing the sea, as well as deck chairs and umbrellas on the beach. Beyond this single trace of civilization, the beach is entirely wild and really splendid. One part is reserved for naturists, which is quite rare in the country.",/en/lifestyle/
Pharrell Williams puts on a show for Louis Vuitton at Paris Fashion Week,Feature,"Pharrell Williams had provided a warning: ""The show will be a striking immersive experience."" Meeting in Paris at Louis Vuitton's offices on June 13, the music producer and singer appointed head of Vuitton's men's line (owned by LVMH) had deployed all the diplomacy an American superstar is capable of to reveal nothing about his first collection. But he did hint that his first show for the world's biggest luxury brand would be a spectacle, the kind that leaves a lasting impression.On Tuesday, June 20, as part of Paris men's fashion week, the show took place at dusk on the Pont-Neuf bridge, just opposite the Louis Vuitton headquarters and the Cheval Blanc hotel, which is also owned by LVMH.The area had been cordoned off to welcome and ensure the safety of some 1,750 guests, including an unlikely list of celebrities: Beyoncé arrived hand-in-hand with Jay-Z; Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton stepped out onto the golden cobblestones of the bridge early enough to enjoy the setting sun; Naomi Campbell remained stoic amid the cannabis fragrances that punctually perfumed the atmosphere; and Leonardo DiCaprio managed to go unnoticed in the throng of curious onlookers crowding around Zendaya, Kim Kardashian and Lebron James. Rihanna, who arrived late with A$AP Rocky, was discreetly ushered into the middle of the event. Barack and Michelle Obama were scheduled to attend but eventually canceled.Williams wanted to accompany the unveiling of his first collection with musical performances, and therefore organize it on June 21, the day of the Fête de la Musique (an annual event in which live music takes over cities across the country). But he didn't get the go-ahead from the Paris Prefecture of Police. The date conflict didn't mean he would reconsider the nature of his plans: At 10:30 pm, a 50-strong orchestra took to the stage at the end of the bridge, accompanied by star pianist Lang Lang, to perform a classical piece composed for the occasion by Williams. This was followed by a gospel choir of 80 singers, the fashion show and Jay-Z's half-hour concert in which Williams performed his first single, ""Frontin'"" (2003) with him.But the numerous performances certainly did not distract attention from the highly inspired collection. With unexpected acuity, Williams, supported by the creative studio largely inherited from his predecessor Virgil Abloh, proposed 71 looks that reflected his personality even as they refreshed iconic Louis Vuitton styles.The ensemble was a clever blend of streetwear bling and offbeat elegance, with suit jackets worn with skirts, beaded tracksuits, chick-yellow fur coats and crocodile-skin baseball jackets. The brand's emblematic checkerboard was everywhere, blending with pixels and sometimes evoking a camouflage pattern.We also saw the potential of accessories, such as the best-selling Speedy bags, on show here in more luxurious versions in lambskin and bright colors. Or the berets marked ""Lovers"" with the letters L and V stylized like the Louis Vuitton logo. ""Lovers"" is a reference to Williams' home state of Virginia, whose slogan since 1969 has been ""Virginia is for lovers."" The collection draws you in and manages to be simultaneously original and commercial.The success of this first Pharrell Williams show for Louis Vuitton was important, as it was among the most eagerly awaited fashion events of the year. To everyone's surprise, the music producer was appointed artistic director of the men's collections in February, a position that had remained vacant since the sudden death of his predecessor Virgil Abloh in November 2021. In itself, it's hardly surprising that the luxury brand should call upon a star: As recently as May, singer Dua Lipa collaborated with Versace on a capsule collection.But this is the first time that a house of Louis Vuitton's stature has chosen a celebrity to steer its artistic direction over the long term. (Designers' contracts generally last three years, renewable). ""It was a risk,"" said CEO Pietro Beccari, whom we met before the show. ""After Virgil [Abloh], I couldn't have chosen a traditional designer. I needed someone with something extra, a creative who touches people's hearts, through music, collaborations."" For several months now in the fashion world, criticism has been rife: Would a music producer know how to come up with a viable clothing collection?Williams did not study fashion any more than Abloh, who graduated with a degree in architecture. But that did not the American pop star from launching his streetwear label Billionaire Boys Club with designer Nigo in 2003 and later collaborating with Adidas, Chanel, Uniqlo, Moncler and others. Williams eventually began working with Louis Vuitton in 2008, where he met Pietro Beccari.The Italian businessman became Louis Vuitton's CEO in February and one of his first decisions was to appoint Williams: ""I sent him a message on December 22, 2022, and we spoke on the 23rd. On February 14, he signed his contract and moved to Paris. It's true that he didn't go to fashion school. But he didn't study music either, and that didn't stop him from winning 13 Grammy Awards.""The world's biggest luxury brand, with sales set to exceed €20 billion by 2022, needed a popular and influential figure to continue its growth. Pharrell, a famous and mainstream pop star known to both Generation Z and the 40-somethings who danced to his own Daft Punk remixes in the early 2000s, also has 14.6 million Instagram followers. ""With Pharrell, we'll probably reach people who had never heard of Louis Vuitton or thought LV had nothing to offer them,"" Beccari added.Williams, for his part, said that he ""never imagined I'd get here"" and ""pinches himself every day to check [that he] isn't dreaming."" But he isn't worried about the scale of the task: ""Music and fashion are different languages, but the essence is the same: In both cases, I'm a conductor. At Louis Vuitton, it's a very big orchestra."" It is true that today, the role of an artistic director is less to design clothes than to have a global, coherent vision for the brand. Responsible for style, image, communications and events, the designer must above all be a charismatic leader capable of directing teams.When he greeted the audience at the end of the show, Williams made sure to bring along the creative studio that brought the collection to life. In the process, he kissed his wife and children, who were seated in the front row next to clan of Bernard Arnault (CEO of LVMH), his adopted family.",/en/lifestyle/
"Gdansk, the city of a thousand pasts",Feature,"The enigmatic motto of the Hanseatic sailors – Navigare necesse est, vivere non est necesse (""To sail the seas is a necessity, to live is not"") – applies perfectly to Gdansk, where it can be found painted on the facades of houses. Without its access to the sea, without its ships and their cargoes, Gdansk – nicknamed the Pearl of the Baltic – would be nothing. Ruled by Germany on several occasions under the name of Danzig, the present-day Gdansk has changed a great deal, more than 30 years after communism came to an end in Poland. From the historic center to the banks of the Vistula and the long beach at Sopot, construction sites abound and the streets emanate a youthful vibe. Tourists mingle with locals late into the night in this new favorite destination for Baltic and Scandinavian bachelor and bachelorette parties.If you had to choose a system for discovering the city, you could travel back in time, starting with recent history and working back to the Middle Ages. In other words, starting from the city's working-class heart – the former shipyards – and moving inland towards Malbork Castle, and ending in Sopot, on the Baltic coast.The European Solidarity Center – a reference to Solidarnosc, the trade union founded in Gdansk in 1980 – was inaugurated in 2014. Its rusty Corten steel facades have been fixed onto the site of the former Lenin shipyards, whose entrance gate has been preserved. The museum illustrates the almost immediate transformation of a country's political history into History with a capital ""H."" The halls tell the story of the great Gdansk shipyard workers' strike of 1980, but also of previously lost battles and the end of communist regimes in Eastern Europe. They will not arouse the same emotions in all visitors. It's a question of generation: Those too young to remember the colored pen with which Lech Walesa signed the Gdansk agreements on August 31 1980, in front of television cameras from all over the world, will not have that strange feeling of seeing the news of their youth ""committed to memory.""Those who haven't lived through it will find it hard to believe that, during the summer of 1980, Poland was making the headlines every day in France and around the world. It was embodied in faces that the museum brings (back) to life: like Walesa, the mustachioed leader of the strikers, and President Wojciech Jaruzelski, wearing tinted glasses. And let's not forget figures from the Church: Pope John Paul II, elected in 1978, who backed the striking workers, as well as the sorrow-stricken face of Jerzy Popieluszko, chaplain to Solidarnosc, assassinated by the Communist political police in 1984. The museum brings the 1980s vividly to life, with leaflets, photos, state TV footage, magazine covers and eyewitness accounts. Winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, and then Poland's first democratically elected president in 1990, Walesa still has his offices in part of the museum.",/en/lifestyle/
Is twerking feminist?,    This sensual dance based on shaking the pelvis is a way for women to take ownership of their bodies. Here's a look at some of the women who practice it. ,"One Monday evening, at 7 pm, when Booty Therapy teacher Dominique Villedieu, 40, entered the studio, the participants cheered and screamed, as if she were Beyoncé. Among these 14 women, eight had come together to this class, in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, as part of a bachelorette party for their friend Thaïs (she requested anonymity), 24. ""I don't see a pole, so it must be twerking!"" said one of the women who didn't know what activity her friends had chosen. Twerking is a sensual dance in which the hips and pelvis are moved back and forth. The women, dressed in leggings and knee pads to protect their kneecaps from impact, started with a warm-up to frenzied Afro beats.Villedieu quickly divided the beginners into two groups. While one performed a buttock-shaking movement on the floor, the other sang along to Nicki Minaj's ""Anaconda,"" shouting, as in the song: ""Oh my Gosh, look at her butt."" It's a way of valuing yourself rather than judging yourself"" said Villedieu, a nurse by profession. She added: ""You have to feel confident. Sometimes, very intimate and deep things come out in the middle of a class."" At one point, one of the bride-to-be's friends told another girl: ""You look like you're jogging when you twerk!"" Villedieu gently reminded her that kindness is the rule here. No mockery is allowed.Villedieu is one of four Parisian teachers in Booty Therapy, a dance program created in 1996 by choreographer and actress Maïmouna Coulibaly, 48, author of Je me relève (""I'm picking myself up"" Anne Carrière, 2021). Coulibaly, who underwent female circumcision at the age of 4 in Mali, and was raped and sexually assaulted several times during her childhood and youth in Grigny (a working-class suburb in northern France), says she was able to reclaim her body and free herself from her traumas thanks to dance, and twerking in particular.The Booty Therapy program exists in several cities in France, Germany and Switzerland, and boasts over 12,000 practitioners from a wide range of backgrounds. The course blends Afro dance, personal development and theatrical exercises. In short, twerking is all about having fun, exercising and feeling good about yourself. But it is also about making a point: Coulibaly takes a political approach, that of a re-appropriation of the female body, of a visible affirmation of the right to use it freely. ""Cellulite, fat, curves... In twerking, the flaws in magazines are our assets. Whether you're short, tall, flat or fat, you're welcome,"" said Patricia Badin, another Parisian teacher.",/en/lifestyle/
Paris Fashion Week: Japanese designers take on deconstruction and exploration,"    Whether it's a wave-patterned judo jacket at Kenzo, a dungaree-skirt hybrid at Sacai or mutant shoes at Comme des Garçons, three Japanese visions of menswear shook up the Paris catwalks. ","Paris Fashion Week attracts designers from all over the world, but the Japanese contingent is often the most consistent. For the men's spring-summer 2024 season, which ended on June 25, three of them proposed radically different visions.Appointed head of Kenzo in September 2021, Japanese designer Nigo symbolically chose the Debilly footbridge over the Seine, ""with the Palais de Tokyo on one side and the Eiffel Tower on the other,"" to present a collection weaving links between East and West. Japanese references took the form of an indigo judo jacket worn over a shirt, or the repeated vague seigaiha motif on a hooded jacket. The collection vacillates somewhat between streetwear references (cargo pants, faded denim) and timeless chic (light linen suit, belted coat), resulting in a vague stylistic statement despite some good ideas. ""I like to create different characters,"" said Nigo.From the same generation, Sacai's Chitose Abe has made the dissection and deconstruction of clothing her signature style. She has no equal when it comes to dismantling a basic garment and adding slits, pockets and cut-outs. This season, the contrast between work or outdoor wear (parkas, windbreakers) on the one hand and a light Californian breeze (floral motifs, nonchalant acid knits, surfer-style pearl necklaces) on the other creates a very controlled cool. These hybrids can only be from the Japanese, such as a dungaree top sewn with a large pleated, split petticoat that flutters in the wind.Meanwhile, Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons opted for an even more radical exploration. In a dark, deserted parking lot, her models walked in mesh covered in jungle print and red theater curtains; in black jackets glued together, or turned inside out, enhanced by epaulets cut with clean edges, to which strands of synthetic hair sometimes clung; or in skirts composed of feather-like bangs.As always with Comme des Garçons, the feet and head were just as important as the torso: The eye was instantly drawn to the mutant shoes, designed for four feet, or to the wigs in which stemware, dinosaur and fish toys, flashlights, sea urchins and forks were wedged. Memories of a holiday or a nightmare? Kawakubo's only clue was a cryptic comment: ""In order to find a new world, we have to go beyond reality."" That's Paris!",/en/lifestyle/
Royal flush for Jacquemus in Versailles,"    Staged off the Paris Fashion Week calendar, the brand took over the French palace for an extremely photogenic show where a limited audience of celebrity guests seated in boats admired a collection inspired by... Princess Diana. ","With Paris men's fashion week officially over on June 25, the off-calendar shows have begun! Ahead of Patou, Celine, and Alaïa on July 2, Jacquemus took the lead in Versailles on Monday, June 26, with a fall-winter 2023-2024 collection, already available in stores. As per usual, the young brand demonstrated its ability to compete with the biggest names by staging a visually striking event.Designer Simon Porte Jacquemus is known for choosing settings that evoke his native South. In the past, he has taken over a lavender field in Provence, a salt reserve in Arles, a cove in Marseille... ""I wanted to switch up my aesthetic and had dreamt about Versailles,"" he explained after the show. ""But I wanted to stay true to our DNA by being in nature, on the water, and not under the palace's gold.""The 200 or so guests, amongst whom were Eva Longoria, Victoria and David Beckham, Adèle Exarchopoulos, and designers from Courrèges, Schiaparelli, Coperni, and Ludovic de Saint Sernin, climbed two by two onto boats lined up on the Grand Canal opposite the runway, which consisted of a long bright red carpet rolled out on the grass alongside the ornamental lake. The staging couldn't have been any more photogenic – both from the point of view of the drone filming the strip of red standing out against the green of the park, and from the point of view of the guests, who were only too happy to be photographed in their little boats, parasol in one hand, with the palace in the distance.The collection itself was not quite so straightforward, and Simon Porte Jacquemus acknowledges its ""absurdity"". When after months of negotiations he was granted permission to showcase his collection at Versailles, the designer initially turned to Marie-Antoinette and the 18th century for inspiration, and quite rightly so. ""But I needed to make more sense of it by exposing it to a more modern inspiration. I turned to Princess Diana's outfits of the 1980s and 90s.""In the end, Princess Diana became the leading light in a collection that retraces her life. First, there were tutus, bras, and sheer gowns evoking her younger years, then came the puff-sleeved wedding dress. William and Harry, her sons, were depicted by two models wearing wide-striped shirts. After a few variations on the deconstructed suit appeared the famous ""revenge dress"" showcasing bare shoulders and legs... And in the midst of all this, a handful of male silhouettes wearing black suits with bare backs.There were also stunning stockings in red or white lace, as well as a bubble dress embroidered with metallic flowers. Jacquemus tells us that these are references to Donkey Skin, Jacques Demy's 1970 movie – whose soundtrack is also featured. ""What could be more French than Donkey Skin?"" asked the designer. To close the show, he chose three evening gowns each with long sheer trains: One blue, one white, and last, one red. ""The French flag is beautiful, and doesn't just belong to political extremists,"" said Jacquemus. ""I love my country, and I want to express it."" Who cares if, historically speaking, Versailles isn't exactly the birthplace of the tricolor flag imposed by the revolutionaries on King Louis XVI.Admittedly, by taking over Versailles – something other fashion brands have never really been so interested in doing before – Jacquemus gave the palace a youthful feel. That's one of the reasons why the Versailles team decided to open its gates to Jacquemus, as well as to any future sponsorship deal. ""Even if what we've done here is just a drop in the ocean, I'm overwhelmed with the fact we've been able to do it,"" said Simon Porte Jacquemus, clearly moved that his brand – which has only been going for under 15 years – is capable of opening such grand doors.Buoyed by its growing success in recent years (€200 million in sales by the end of 2022), the brand is scheduled to turn the ephemeral Avenue Montaigne boutique into a perennial store and to open up multiple new points of sale in 2024. Between their impacting catwalk show, their cultural patronage, and their large network of physical stores, Jacquemus is definitely adopting the strategy of the historic luxury houses owned by major groups such as LVMH or Kering. The same groups that covet this independent label and, once again, must have appreciated its catwalk genius.",/en/lifestyle/
Sample a taste of the world in Paris at these five international cafés,"    Looking for some Swedish kanelbullar or cold somen noodles from Japan? You don't have to look too far: Le Monde has picked five cafés that are a part of international cultural institutions in Paris for a linguistic, and tasty, immersion. ","Paris's cafés, brasseries and other restaurants are not short of inspiration, and combining culture and food is more than possible in the capital thanks to the cafés nestled within foreign cultural institutes. Le Monde takes a look at some exotic addresses.A must-see in the Marais district. Just a stone's throw from the Place des Vosges, the Swedish Institute – the country's only cultural center abroad – has been housed in the Hôtel de Marle since 1971. A very active center, it offers temporary exhibitions, film screenings and celebrations to mark key Swedish dates, such as Midsommar on June 21.In the pretty cobbled courtyard of this handsome townhouse, Café Fika (Swedish for coffee break), inaugurated in 2022, offers Scandinavian pastries all day long – including the must-have Kanelbullar, sweet cinnamon buns – and also Swedish-flavored open sandwiches (gravlax salmon or marinated herring on rye bread, meatballs with lingonberry jam – from €8 to €10) and salads at lunchtime, for €11. Swedish chef Maria Printz Emond's cooking is tasty and generous.Tucked away in the nooks and crannies of the Maison de l'Amérique Latine's beautiful townhouse on the left bank's Boulevard Saint-Germain, Café Sigmund is the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Less stuffy (and less expensive) than the Maison's restaurant, the café, which also serves as a quiet meeting place for employees, offers original, seasonal cuisine inspired by the South American continent, such as fish ceviches, quesadillas, nachos and guacamole, or entrecôte steak with chimichurri sauce. The menu is priced at €18,50 and is sure to satisfy any appetite.

15 artisanal ice creams across France good enough to make you melt,"    From Ardèche chestnuts to popcorn or Calvados apples, Le Monde has chosen the best ice cream and sorbet flavors to try this summer. ","If you're a fan of quality ice creams, you probably already know that most of those consumed in France are produced either by industrial manufacturers or by ice cream shops in name only. These fake ice cream makers buy powdered premixes packed with colorants, stabilizers, synthetic flavors and vegetable fats (including palm oil).Under French law, you only need to assemble these products on-site to qualify for the glace maison label or to have an employee with a CAP glacier certificate to call yourself an artisan ice cream maker. To make sure you don't get fooled, Le Monde has selected 15 master ice cream makers – in no particular order – for 2023, some of the best artisanal ice cream makers in France. Get your cones, or pots, ready!Created in 2021 by Lionel Chauvin, Enzo & Lily has quickly become one of the capital's finest ice cream parlors. Chauvin first worked with his grandfather, the legendary Raymond Berthillon, and his father Bernard Chauvin for several years. He launched his own brand to make his own handcrafted sorbets and ice creams, with no additives and only high-quality ingredients. His products advocate a more reasoned and thoughtful approach to production, with a focus on quality and transparency.The must-try flavor: Forget all your preconceptions about plant-based ice creams, because Chauvin has devised a near-perfect recipe here, with oat milk, pistachio paste from Chocolaterie du Pecq, a touch of sugar and coconut oil for texture. The taste is both powerful and sweet, with a long, nutty finish and a hint of butter. It's our favorite of the selection.Summer novelty flavors: vanilla pear tatin, rice pudding, sakura, black sesame, wasabi.Top 3 sellers: pistachio, mango and blackcurrant.Price: €16 (500 milliliter pot).A must in Marseille's Panier district, Le Glacier du Roi is first and foremost a family business. Florence Bianchi and Sandrine, her eldest daughter, trained in Milan before opening their first location in 2009, followed by a second in 2016. Today, the youngest daughter Laure has taken up the torch. The ice creams are made without eggs and with AOC Bresse milk and cream, while the sorbets are made with fresh fruit, water and fructose.The must-try flavor: A local specialty, navette is a Provencal cookie with an orange blossom flavor. In 2009, Le Glacier du Roi was inspired to perpetuate Provence's traditions by creating Navettissimo. Navettissimo is an ice cream made with fresh milk and AOC crème fraîche from Bresse, flavored with orange blossom and including broken navettes from José Orsoni's historic cookie factory. The ice cream is creamy, with the floral sweetness of the orange blossom and the crunchy, sweet texture of the navette.",/en/lifestyle/
France to pay bonus for shoes and clothing repairs to cut waste,"    The move aims to cut down on the 700,000 tonnes of clothes thrown away by French people each year, two-thirds of which end up in landfills. Under the scheme, customers will be able to claim €7 for mending a heel and €10-€25 for clothing repairs. ","From October, France will pay a bonus to encourage people to have their clothes and shoes repaired rather than throwing them away, the government said.The move aims to cut down on the 700,000 tonnes of clothes thrown away by French people each year, two-thirds of which end up in landfills.""From October, consumers will be able to be supported in the repair of their clothes and shoes,"" Secretary of State for Ecology Berangere Couillard said Tuesday, July 11, during a visit to the Paris premises of La Caserne, a hub for responsible fashion.  She invited ""all sewing workshops and shoemakers to join the system"", to be labelled by eco-organisation Refashion.Under the scheme, customers will be able to claim €7 for mending a heel and €10-€25 for clothing repairs from a €154 million fund set up to cover 2023-2028.In France, 3.3 billion pieces of clothing, shoes and household linen were put on the market in 2022, according to Refashion, which has been instructed by the government to support a more sustainable industry.""The goal is to support those who do the repairs,"" Couillard said, referring to sewing workshops but also those brands which offer repair services.Modeled after the household appliance repair bonus, the aid is part of a vast reform of the textile sector, one of the most polluting industries on the planet, initiated by the French government since the end of 2022. Its objectives include forcing brands to have more traceability and to financially support organizations specializing in reusing and recycling clothing.",/en/lifestyle/
Seven cocktail recipes to take you around the world,Selection,"Lost in the maze of small gray residences in Tokyo's bustling Ebisu district, Bar Trench is a cozy island of glass and dark wood. The bartender, Rogerio Igarashi Vaz, sports a white jacket emblazoned with the bar's logo, a chevron mustache and slicked-back hair. He described the bar as being ""somewhere between the Japanese style, with its rather formal way of shaking, and the izakaya style, which is very relaxed.""The jewel in the crown of the menu devised by the Japanese-Brazilian, the Trench 75 is a local version of the famous French 75, a cocktail born in 1925 on the mahogany of Harry's Bar on Rue Daunou, in homage to the 75 cannon, the ""king cannon"" from the WWI trenches. At Trench, this cocktail made with gin, lemon juice, champagne and absinthe is given a Japanese twist: The champagne is followed by a sparkling sake called Dassai, and the gin used is a Nikka Coffey, ""with an aftertaste of green pepper."" The result is a ""sparkling, refreshing"" cocktail, said Vaz.The recipe:In a shaker, pour 30 ml Nikka Coffey gin, 15 ml lemon juice, 10 ml acacia honey syrup. Shake, then pour into a cocktail glass. Add 30 ml Dassai sparkling sake and garnish with a thin slice of dried lime.Ross Simon has come all the way from the hills of Scotland to shape the cocktails at the Bitter & Twisted Cocktail Parlour, located in the Luhrs Tower, a 1924 Art Deco building. At the time, the building was the tallest in the American Southwest (56 meters) and housed the headquarters of the Arizona Prohibition Office. It's a fine piece of revenge, then, for this establishment, which ranked 44th on the list of the 50 best bars in North America in 2022. The menu features 74 cocktails. To help you find your way around, the menu features a themed game. Adventurers search not for the Lost Ark, but for the perfect drink. The star cocktail is the Born Tequila. Delicate souls, please refrain: The drink is spicy.The recipe:Tequila, sage, lime, mango syrup and pineapple juice. And don't forget the peppers! Sage gives a desert scent; tequila, a cactus scent. Five types of chili pepper are macerated in the alcohol to give it a spicy kick.The Magda restaurant has the immense privilege of occupying the former gardens of the 17th-century El Carmen convent, once home to 13,000 fruit trees. Today, in a shaded courtyard cooled by green walls, a dozen tables are set up in front of a stage for musicians. Inside, the rooms feature a sophisticated design in bluish tones.",/en/lifestyle/
"The smile industry, a radiant business",News,"At the entrance to the vast production workshop, the sizeable glass roof with its well of natural light almost clashes with the hum of the machines. ""We wanted it to be pleasant. Just because we're in a factory, it doesn't mean that it has to be ugly,"" smiled Olivia Veran, before pointing to a large empty space. ""This is where the two new automated manufacturing lines for dental aligners will be installed, over the next few months,"" explained Biotech Dental's general manager, also a dental surgeon.The Provence-based firm, located in Salon-de-Provence, southern France, has invested €15 million in this brand-new 3,500 square-meter site, destined to become the flagship of its Smilers brand, selling transparent dental aligners. ""We've gone from an average daily output of 2,500 aligners to almost 7,000. We're going to further expand our production capacity to 17,500 aligners a day by the end of the year,"" explained the company's president, Philippe Veran.A few yards away, employees were busy processing the day's orders, thermoforming dental appliances from resin models fresh from the 3D printer set up next door. ""Products are custom-made for each patient from treatment plans drawn up by our teams of orthodontists,"" he continued.In their offices upstairs, these smile specialists use an artificial intelligence software to determine the various tooth adjustments required to correct the alignment. Once amended and approved by the patient's orthodontist or referring dentist, their projections are sent for production. ""On average, an overall treatment involves 34 to 35 aligners per patient. Each tray is worn for one to two weeks,"" explained Olivia Veran.A French champion of dental implants, the company co-founded by Philippe Veran in 1987 made a transition towards invisible aligners in 2013. At the time, however, the market was still locked in by patents held by American company Align Technology, which sells its aligners to orthodontists worldwide under the Invisalign brand. Taking the risk, the entrepreneur nevertheless launched his own products. To avoid a head-on collision with the American giant, the Provençal entrepreneur first solicited dentists only, a market overlooked by Align Technology. The strategy paid off: today, dentists make up nearly 70% of his customer base.Having slipped under the American radar, the company from Salon-de-Provence is now slowly establishing itself in this fast-growing market. To stand out from the competition, it relies on the quality of its made-in-France dental appliances. The trays are made in the Provence-based factory from plastic imported from Germany, guaranteed bisphenol, mercury and latex free. The French firm takes care of every detail, even hand-polishing each aligner, ""just like fine jewelry,""  said Olivia Veran, to remove the tiniest roughness.",/en/lifestyle/
Sarah Nsikak's patchwork art blurs boundaries and spans continents,Profile,"Under Sarah Nsikak's fingers, every piece of fabric is given a new lease on life as a garment or a textile painting. Yet it was with paper that the Okhlahoma-born American-Nigerian artist learned to use needles and threads as a child. Her grandmother, a Nigerian seamstress who emigrated to the United States, was reluctant to entrust her with what would soon become her favorite material.""In Nigeria, the village seamstress makes the costumes that mark the major stages of life, from weddings to funeral wakes. It's a prestigious role,"" said the 32-year-old artist. Every member of a family wears the same print, like identity papers on their skin. In that same vein, Nsikak thinks of her textile works as personal banners and the dresses of her label La Réunion, created in 2019, as almost sacred outfits.Thanks to her grandmother's advice, Nsikak learned to sew by reproducing patterns from catalogs that came in the mail. ""I used old, worn-out and very soft T-shirts that I really liked the feel of,"" she recalled. The shrewd little girl understood that she could always assemble small scraps of fabric whenever she was short of raw material.""Patchwork was far from fashionable. I used to find subtle ways of camouflaging my handiwork by using patches inside the garment or sewing in the cleanest, most invisible way possible. Today it's the opposite. We love imperfections, so I have much more freedom. I have fun highlighting stitches with colored threads, and I emphasize a more raw look,"" noted the designer that turned patchwork into her trademark.Influenced by the quilts of the rural and deeply religious America she grew up in, Nsikak's pieces are above all a celebration of her origins and little-known African cultures.""For people around us in Oklahoma, where I was born, Africa was synonymous with Action Against Hunger campaigns, misery, villages without schools. It took us a lot of courage and perseverance to make our mark and show the richness of our country.""While for her mother, this meant having a successful business and creating a small church, for Nsikak, this pride was expressed with a needle and returning to her roots. Inspired by Asafo flags, military artifacts from Ghana, Nsikak begins her textile paintings with a layer of fabric like thick linen. Shen then coarsely hand-sews fine cotton shapes on it, simplified silhouettes and symbols that serve as reading keys: a bird for peace or a hut for community. Her clothing line, La Réunion, draws on the history of Herero women's dresses in Namibia.",/en/lifestyle/
'Banh mi is the product of cultural mixing and colonization',Interview,"Many Asian restaurants in France blur Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese and Cambodian specialties together in a confusing mix that does no honor to the specialties of those countries. With her Singaporean-born partner, Pearlyn Lee, chef Khanh-Ly Huynh has opened two restaurants in Paris to set the record straight and put the dishes in the right place on the menu. The first one is called The Hood and is a chic, cozy little restaurant. There, you can taste the best Vietnamese fried chicken in Paris (made with high-quality poultry from the southwestern Landes region) and memorable pandan cakes (flavored with the juices of the plant of the same name). Across the street, Nonette serves tasty banh mi, Vietnamese stuffed sandwiches made from baguette.At the age of 9, Khanh-Ly Huynh used to help her parents, of Vietnamese origin, in their restaurant in Orléans, south of Paris. During her studies, she remembers ""cooking endlessly"" in her spare time, without imagining that she would make a career of it. Unbeknownst to her, a friend signed her up for the MasterChef France TV show. And she won, in 2015. Then, she launched The Hood, where she is fighting a battle that is dear to her heart: restoring the authenticity of her Asian culture.I can still see myself in my family's Renault 21, visiting my uncles in Morbihan [Brittany]. My parents always set aside some banh mi, religiously wrapped in aluminum foil. They often topped them with a fried egg and seasoned them with Maggi aroma, one of the hallmarks of Vietnamese cuisine. At the time, I didn't realize how fresh and delicious my parents' sandwiches were. They never used frozen ingredients.The other day, I almost got into a fight with a customer who assured me that the sandwich doesn't exist in Vietnam! The banh mi is the product of cultural mixing and colonization. It appeared in the mid-19th century and gained popularity shortly after the departure of the French from Indochina, in the mid-20th century. I went to Vietnam for the first time in 2014, then returned several times. Today, it really is the street food dish you find on every street corner, usually in small mobile booths. You can have it for breakfast or in the middle of the night. And even though prices have gone up a lot, it's still affordable. At Nonette, I've kept to this philosophy. The first sandwich, with wok-sautéed eggplant, retails for 7€.In Vietnam, thousands of recipes have been tried. And today there's still no such thing as a ""classic"" banh mi. You can find them with fried or braised fish, seafood – something I've never found in Paris – but also with many plant-based fillings. You can also find deconstructed banh mi, such as meatballs in tomato sauce, served on a plate, with the bread next to them for dipping.No. Here, I see that recipes have been standardized. For example, Vietnamese restaurants can't leave crispy pork banh mi off the menu. For my part, I try to experiment. Right now, I'm trying with a sardines and tomato banh mi. It's been pointed out to me that my sandwiches don't taste like those you'd find in the 13th arrondissement, where many Asian communities live. But it's not my vocation to be like them and I don't particularly want us to move towards identical tastes. As far as I'm concerned, we can have fun if we respect certain codes in terms of aromas and textures.A banh mi is broken down into several layers. First, there's the base: bread, often made with a mixture of wheat and rice flour in Vietnam. Then comes fat, which can be butter, mayonnaise, spreadable cheese, green onion oil or poultry fat. Then come the proteins, which can be of either animal or vegetable origin, such as grilled meat, tofu, and so on. Finally, you add the aromatic herbs: coriander, green onion or dill, among others. Pickles can be added to the dish, as can cucumber, the use of which remains controversial. It adds a crunchy texture, but is also watery, which can put off some customers.I tried everything, working with a dozen bakeries: breads with sesame, sourdough, charcoal and even matcha tea. None of them worked! If the bread isn't neutral in taste, it overshadows the other ingredients. And if it's too dense, the filling slips out. Finally, if the bread is too thick, you will be full after just a few bites. A banh mi already contains almost 250 grams of filling! Today, I've gone back to the bread of our former colonized country, which I've also found in Senegal and other Maghreb countries: a white, crisp, light bread, which may not be popular with gourmets, but which blends perfectly with the other ingredients.The first time she tried it, my mother made sure I made all my own cold cuts. I said yes. She tasted and just nodded, which in her undemonstrative home meant she approved of my sandwiches. My father tried a banh mi with cha lua, a kind of Vietnamese pork bologna that looks like a big gray-beige sausage, and he liked it a lot. It was very important to me that they liked it.I'm sure it will! Nowadays, it's hard to find a good sandwich at an affordable price: Quality bakeries are very rare. And I don't even want to mention what you can find in train stations or airports. The banh mi is a welcome alternative, even if, for the time being, it can be found mainly in Paris.In this series, six chefs reveal how they have adapted a common foreign dish to French tastes and ingredients.",/en/lifestyle/
'Falafel is still the iconic street food dish in Syria',"    'A world of street food' (2/6). In Lille's Grand Scène food court, Bassam Ataya and his wife Reem serve small falafel patties made from a traditional Syrian recipe with perfectly-sized chickpeas from the Vendée. ","""Another plate of falafels darling!"" On the second floor of the huge Grand Scène food court in Lille, vibrant with music and pop-colored frescoes, Reem Ataya slaloms between the quickly-packed wooden tables located in front of the stand where her husband, Bassem Ataya, is browning his chickpea patties. The couple seem so comfortable with this culinary exercise that they seem to have 15 years of experience in the restaurant business. But 15 years ago, Reem was teaching French at Damascus University and the Institut français, while Bassem was working as administrative manager of the Syrian magazine Chabablek.In 2012, shortly after the outbreak of the war in their home country, the couple decided to flee with their young daughter, Mirah. They settled in Egypt before arriving in Lambersart, northern France, in 2014. The mother of a former colleague took them in.Bassem, unemployed, got busy cooking in their new place. ""At home, we show our affection and love through cooking,"" Reem said. Her husband had plenty of practice: The youngest of 12 brothers and sisters, he was involved in preparing the family's food from an early age and helped his parents in the small restaurant they ran in Damascus.From neighbors' parties to charity events, it did not take long for his talents as a chef to make  themselves known in Lambersart. He worked as a caterer and took part in the Refugee Food Festival, when restaurants opened their doors to refugees trained in cooking. In June 2021, the couple opened Ataya. It is one of 10 stands in the Grand Scène, a large food court in the center of Lille, where falafels reign over the menu.Reem Ataya: Because it's the iconic street food dish in Syria, the one that best represents our country. Over there, you can eat it almost anywhere, anytime. You can find it in any restaurant, but there are also specialized ones. When we were young, one of the most famous in Damascus was Ala Kefak: the owner caused a scandal by putting his falafels in baguette and spreading mayonnaise on the bread. We teenagers loved it, but our parents hated it!Bassem Ataya: That is quite a controversial subject, as everyone tries to make this dish their own, but historians point to two possibilities. Falafel may first have appeared among the Egyptian Copts, who still make fava bean-based patties called falafels or tamiya, depending on which region you're in. Another version puts the origin of falafel in Palestine, where this specialty is made from chickpeas, as in Syria. There are no sources to settle the debate. What is certain is that falafel is a snack that can be found today in almost every corner of the Middle East, whether or not it is eaten in pita bread.R. A.: Yes, except the price has risen enormously since the start of the war. When we were students, it was really the hearty, cheap food we could eat for lunch and dinner, often with ayran, a drink made from yogurt and salt water. It's much more complicated to [get food to] eat today, because of inflation. And it's even more complicated for meat dishes.B. A.: I make them according to a traditional recipe, the same as my mom's. I use fresh herbs – quite a few compared to other recipes – but also ground coriander and cumin. What surprised our French customers, who sometimes bought their falafels from caterers or supermarkets, was not so much the right balance of spices, but the crunchiness and softness. But there's no big secret: you only need to fry them once – reheating softens them – and serve them right away! We offer the sauce – a mixture of yogurt and tahini, [which is] sesame paste – separately, also to avoid softening them.R. A. : It's traditionally the women who cook, but it's not frowned upon for a man: it's even said to be better when they take care of it! Every Friday morning, before going to prayer, it's customary for the men to prepare breakfast and sometimes lunch, sometimes including falafel.B. A.: The falafels we serve at Ataya are traditional falafels, but we make sure to use French ingredients. Our chickpeas, for example, come from the Vendée [in western France]. They're exactly the right diameter, about the size of a hazelnut: smaller ones would make the falafels too dry; larger ones would make the falafels absorb too much water. For a while, we also offered ""falafaluches,"" by putting falafels into faluche, a soft, dense bread typical of the North: it was a way for us to thank the region for welcoming us. But this bread was difficult to preserve and very filling: today, we only serve pita bread.B. A.: One evening, paired with Chef Simon [Bertrand Simon, cooking teacher and creator of the very popular website Chefsimon.com], we prepared over 900 falafels! I love making them in huge quantities. And it's also satisfying to see that a very diverse clientele comes to us. Falafel is a dish that allows you to fill up on a budget: our galette, sold with seasonal crudités and pickles, costs just €9. It's also a vegan dish – gluten-free if you stick to the original recipe and don't cut wheat flour into the dough. There's something magical about seeing a thousand-year-old dish stay trendy!In this series, six chefs reveal how they have adapted a common foreign dish to French tastes and ingredients.",/en/lifestyle/
'The main ingredient in a good onigiri is love',Series,"In France, every Japanese restaurant offers sushi, but onigiri are very rarely to be found. Yet, those delicious little filled rice balls are very popular in Japan. Ai Watanabe and her partner Samuel Trifot have decided to make up for this shortfall by becoming the unofficial ambassadors of the specialty in Paris.The 30-something couple has already done a lot for the cause, offering cooking workshops and opening the Gili-Gili in the Pigalle district in 2018, a tiny one-room restaurant with just a counter and two stools. They even published a book: Onigiri, boules de riz garnies japonaises (""Onigiri: Filled Japanese Rice Balls"").Tandem cooks and couple in life, Watanabe and Trifot met in Sydney, Australia. Ai, who comes from a dynasty of chefs and rice growers, already had a special relationship with the dish. For his part, Samuel was also familiar with the Japanese specialty. He is a fan of manga (whose characters often gorge on onigiri) and has a habit of preparing rice dumplings during his backpacking trips. ""He proposed opening an onigiri restaurant even before he proposed to me,"" said Ai with a laugh.Their eatery, however small, opens up new horizons for curious gourmets, who find a little tasty surprise in every ball: umeboshi (a small dried and salted plum), kombu (edible seaweed) or tuna mayonnaise, now one of the most popular toppings in Japan.Ai Watanabe: Onigiri comes from the verb ""nigiru,"" ""to grasp."" When shaping a rice ball, the gesture, the hand's contact with the food, is very important. The Japanese, under the spiritual influence of Shintoism and Buddhism, are convinced that a cook can use their hands to pass on love and feelings through food. It's often said that the main ingredient in a good onigiri is love. It may sound cliché, but it's true. Onigiri is the archetypal Japanese soul food. If it's loaded with good vibes, it fills the eater's body and mind with energy.A. W.: The oldest trace of onigiri is an almost 2,000-year-old fossil found in the Ishikawa prefecture. At the time, this food could also be an offering to the gods or a protection against bad luck.Samuel Trifot: In fact, there are also cubic ones and round ones. Some can be eaten hot or cold and the fillings are very diverse. But there's one constant: Each onigiri is around 120 calories, or almost half a baguette! It's important to remember that, in the beginning, this dish was mainly used as a practical way of carrying and storing food for workers on their way to the fields or the forest. You had to be able to get your fill.A. W.: When I was little, I did a lot of activities – piano lessons, swimming, etc. My grandfather would drive me from one place to another. In his car, I would gobble down the onigiri prepared by my grandmother, with eggs or vegetables. You only need one hand to eat them. It's much easier than using a bento box and chopsticks. At every bump in the road, I'd have spilled half of my meal.A. W.: Yes. When I was a kid, there wasn't much choice: just kombu and umeboshi. Nowadays, you can find it with minced steak, [Greek fish roe] tarama, fermented cabbage, you name it!A. W.: Anytime! You can find them in any konbini, those 24-hour grocery stores, for around 120 yen, or €1 each. There are also specialized shops that sell just that. Many gourmets prepare them at home and carry them in lunch boxes. The Japanese are always in a hurry, so onigiri are ideal for snacking in the street, on the train or in a park.S. T.: Once you get the hang of it, it's quick and easy to prepare. We've even posted a short tutorial on YouTube that lasts barely a minute! In Kyoto, chef Toshihiro Aomatsu, who has opened a specialized restaurant called Ao Onigiri, shows on social media how he taught his children to make the dish themselves when they were little more than babies!S. T.: Above all, don't add soy sauce or use vinegar to season the rice. This can happen with onigiri sold in French supermarkets, no doubt for the sake of preservation.S. T.: We work with local and seasonal products. We've stopped making the salmon onigiri that our customers used to love. We use horseradish instead of wasabi. Our shiitake [Japanese mushrooms] grow in the underground parking lot of a building at [Paris metro station] Porte de La Chapelle! We have a hard time only with rice. We tried using French-grown rice from Camargue, but it's simply not as good as Japanese rice. It doesn't have the same texture nor taste and does not hold together as well.S. T.: It's tiring but never boring. The possibilities are endless. There's hardly a liquid ingredient you can't use as a garnish. During the ""Onigiri Action"" operation, run as part of a campaign to fight world hunger, we offered a new onigiri recipe every day throughout the month of October!A. W.: You can't get enough of giving love. When my parents came to visit us in Paris, I greeted them at the airport with a tray of onigiri!In this series, six chefs reveal how they have adapted a common foreign dish to French tastes and ingredients.",/en/lifestyle/
"'In Kinshasa, pondu keeps you going until evening'",Interview,"In the 1990s, Hugues Mbenda, born in 1989, was swaddled behind his mother's back, and she spent a lot of time in the kitchen. ""To make a bit of money, the table at home was turned into a restaurant. So you could say I grew up in the kitchen,"" he said with a smile. He was nine when he left the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to join his father in France. After his mother's death, the teenager took over feeding the family. ""I tinkered with things, even tried to bake bread myself. And when my friends were watching cartoons, I chose to watch Bon Appétit Bien Sûr!, Joël Robuchon's [culinary] TV show.""After graduating from the Lycée Auguste-Escoffier in Eragny (Val-d'Oise) with a vocational baccalaureate in hotel and restaurant management, Mbenda went on to work in some fine-dining establishments (namely Taillevent, Burgundy and Le Violon d'Ingres in Paris; and Les Sources de Caudalie, near Bordeaux). But a trip to Kinshasa made him decide to break free: He wanted to introduce the French gastronomy world to the richness of Congolese flavors.In 2021, he and his partner, Mathilde Godart, opened Libala (""marriage"" in Lingala) in Marseille, where, beneath a constellation of twinkly lights and green plants, you can enjoy a delicious meal for around €15. Dishes include crispy chicken topped with a mango-pimento sauce; a burger served with plantain banana; and falafel made from black-eyed peas (a bean originating in Africa). Delicious Congolese notes add vibrancy to every dish. In the evenings, Libala has recently turned into Kin (short for ""Kinshasa""), a semi-gastronomic restaurant that continues to draw its inspiration from France and the Congo. Here, he champions pondu, a staple dish from his native country, served at lunchtime as a sandwich and in the evening as a condiment.Pondu, which comes from the Lingala language and is pronounced ""pondou,"" is a recipe based on mashed and boiled cassava leaves that is extremely popular in Congo Kinshasa. If you dare hold a traditional wedding without offering pondu, the guests will look at you sideways! The term pondu is used in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but elsewhere, even in nearby Congo-Brazzaville, similar dishes are known as ""saka-saka.""The traditional recipe, the one my mother used to make and the one I make today, starts with crushed cassava leaves, which can be bought in exotic food stores in France in the form of small balls of leaves that have already been chopped, frozen in plastic packaging. Garlic, onions, leeks, peppers and two basic ingredients are added: dried fish, which needs to be rehydrated, and palm oil. It takes just over two hours to prepare.",/en/lifestyle/
"'Ceviche in Peru is everywhere, all the time'","    'A world of street food' (5/6). Six chefs reveal how they have adapted a basic foreign dish to French tastes and ingredients. In Paris, Javier Jimenez Morales and Claudia Perez Vasquez-Solis serve ceviche as they do in Lima: as fresh as can be, for eating on the go, but with a little less spice, to suit the French palate. ","Is ceviche a street food dish? In France, it's hard to imagine, as it's best known as a refined, low-fat appetizer. To introduce the French palate to ""real"" Peruvian ceviche, Javier Jimenez Morales and Claudia Perez Vasquez-Solis have opened The 3 Musketeers. This discreet restaurant in Paris's Latin Quarter is primarily designed for delivery or takeaway, but there's a tiny counter allowing those in no rush to eat this dish as they would in Peru: standing up and on the go.Jimenez Morales, 37, studied cooking and restaurant management. He set up his own pastry shop in Peru and worked in gourmet restaurants in Japan before settling in Paris. Perez Vasquez-Solis, 30, studied at the Cordon Bleu cooking school in Lima. A scholarship took her to Spain, then Paris, where she met Morales, whom she decided to support in her restaurant project, with one idea in mind: to serve quality street food, just like in Lima, where they were both born.Javier Jimenez Morales: And yet it is! In Peru, it's served at small kiosks, where a cook brings out their ready-made components: chopped fish, leche de tigre sauce, sweet potatoes and white corn. All that's left to do is to put it all together in a tray. Customers often eat standing up, facing a counter, using a plastic spoon with small teeth to catch the fish and sauce.Claudia Perez Vasquez-Solis: Historically, it's really the workers' dish. More than 2,000 years ago, before the Incas, there were the Moche people in northern Peru. When they went out to sea to fish in their small boats – totoras –, they ate ceviche. In those days, they didn't mix the ingredients as they do today. They simply shelled the fish, licked a block of salt, picked up some seaweed and bit into a chili pepper. When the recipe reached the mainland, it was adapted. The Moches added tumbo, a highly acidic native fruit, which they marinated the fish in for two or three minutes.C. P. V.-S.: Above all, it's the origin of the word ""ceviche"" that's the subject of debate. Some say it comes from the Quechua word siwichi, meaning ""tender fish."" Others claim, on the contrary, that its origins are Spanish, and it could have the same etymology as the term escabèche, which descends from the Mozarabic word iskebêch, meaning a dish cooked in vinegar. Beyond the etymology of the word, we know it's a Moches dish, which is why it's found throughout Latin America. The Moches were colonized by the Incas, who adopted ceviche and spread it to Colombia, Ecuador, Chile and even part of Brazil, where many different ways of preparing it emerged.",/en/lifestyle/
'Pastrami is a product of Ashkenazi culture',Interview,"Where can you find the best pastrami sandwich? With its crusty bread, tender, cheese-infused meat, and just the right balance of acidity from sauerkraut and sweetness from Thousand Island dressing, the Reuben at Will's Deli in Paris is a hit. The little sandwich shop located in the Sentier neighborhood is always busy. Its owner, William Benitah, plans to expand the brand in Paris and its suburbs in the coming months.Yet nothing predisposed the 64-year-old entrepreneur to become a pastrami specialist: Benitah used to be a vegetarian and worked as a salesperson in the construction industry. After his wife, Isabelle, convinced him to eat meat again, a cousin introduced him to a pastrami sandwich in Montreal in 2011 that changed his life. He discovered ""an explosion of spicy, smoky flavors, the tenderness of the meat and the warmth of the crusty bread. It was love at first sight!""Benitah quit his job and started making pastrami. He supplied five-star hotels (George V), celebrity chefs' restaurants (Joël Robuchon, Yoni Saada), luxury grocery stores (Fauchon, Kaviari) and bakers (Cédric Grolet). In 2020, spurred on by his success and supported by his wife and sons, Simon and Sacha, he took the plunge and opened Will's Deli in order to transform his own product into the sandwich of his dreams.Not a very good one! [In Paris in the 1960s], we ate it cold, without seasoning. It was pretty bland. My mother used to buy it in kosher butcher shops or delis on Rue des Rosiers. She was Sephardic, and didn't know how to prepare it – it's really a product of Ashkenazi culture.It was born in Eastern Europe, probably in Romania [its name comes from the Romanian ""pastra,"" meaning ""to preserve""]. Over there, people ate a lot of potatoes and cabbage with pork. The Ashkenazim looked for an alternative to pork. Most of them were quite poor and made do with the cheapest meat: brisket, which is a tough, fatty part that needs to be simmered for a long time. They first put it in brine to destroy the collagen, then tenderized it in vegetable stock. They found that adding spices improved both taste and preservation – among other things, pepper is bactericidal. Once ready, the meat was placed on top of the sauerkraut for reheating.In the 19th century, Jews who migrated to the United States and Canada adapted the recipe to their new environment. Instead of pepper and coriander, they used mustard seeds, allspice and paprika. In Europe, smoking lasted for quite a while, at low temperatures, to infuse the meat deeply. North American grill culture made it evolve towards more powerful smoking, with the meat marked on the outside but not necessarily deeply smoked on the inside. And, finally, a sauerkraut dish that used to be eaten on a plate was transformed into a more practical sandwich, generally called a Reuben [the origin of this designation is the subject of debate].Yes, but we should not use the word ""sauerkraut,"" otherwise customers get a mental block! When you say ""fermented,"" people think ""probiotics that are good for the gut.""There are as many spice blends as there are Jews who make pastrami! Jewish cuisine is basically a poor man's cuisine, where you make do with what you've got and replace it with something else when you don't have what you need! I was inspired by the Canadian recipe, with allspice, mustard and eight different spices. As I travel the world's delicatessens, I refine my recipe!Traditionally, North American Jews use rye bread with a very dense crumb, [and] caraway and poppy seeds, which is quite stifling. I don't want to add insult to injury, but neither Ashkenazim nor Americans have the reputation of being excellent bakers! At Will's, we work with a baker to make us sourdough in the French tradition, with a hint of rye. The result is close to a country loaf, slightly crusty. But since many customers don't feel like chewing too much and ask us for burger-style buns, we are developing a rye-based brioche bun.When I started making pastrami, I asked various slaughterhouses to supply me with meat, and the only ones that replied were kosher. But I'm looking for other suppliers in order to have organic beef and breeds other than Charolais, Limousin or Normande.Yes, but some customers tell me that it's okay to eat cheese with meat if the meat is kosher. Others don't mix meat and cheese, but they don't wait the required three hours either: they have a cheesecake straight after their sandwich. Kosher is subject to many interpretations!An Ashkenazi will tell you that it's not pastrami if there's no fat! Beef brisket is naturally made up of alternating muscle and fat, and when it melts as it heats up in the sandwich, the fat acts as a flavor enhancer. But many customers ask us to remove the vein of fat when there is some, whereas, paradoxically, on a rib steak, it's fine.Essentially mayonnaise, ketchup and sweet relish – large pickles cut into a mirepoix and cooked with vinegar and sugar. Then it's up to each person to add their own personal touch, [like] vegetables such as carrots or cauliflower, cut very small to get the taste without the texture. But sorry, I can't tell you my secret ingredient. It's what sets me apart from the competition!In this series, six chefs reveal how they have adapted a common foreign dish to French tastes and ingredients.",/en/lifestyle/
Apollo astronaut Thomas Mattingly dies at 87,    The American astronaut formerly part of the Apollo 13 mission played a vital role in ensuring the safe return of its crew through his ground control problem-solving efforts. ,"A NASA astronaut who was removed from the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission but helped bring its crew back home safely thanks to his problem-solving efforts from ground control has died at the age of 87. Thomas K. ""TK"" Mattingly passed away on October 31, the space agency said in a statement Thursday, November 2.His most dramatic role came when he was assigned as command module pilot for the Apollo 13 flight but was grounded 72 hours prior to launch due to exposure to rubella, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said. After an explosion crippled the spacecraft on its way to the Moon, Mattingly, who did not get sick, went to Mission Control and devised procedures to conserve power so the vehicle could successfully re-enter the atmosphere, ensuring astronauts James Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise survived. The mission was dramatized in the 1995 film Apollo 13 in which Mattingly was played by Gary Sinise.Mattingly began his career as a US Navy pilot before being selected to the astronaut class of 1966. He later took on the role of command module pilot on the Apollo 16 mission and was the spacecraft commander in two Space Shuttle missions. ""TK's contributions have allowed for advancements in our learning beyond that of space,"" said Nelson.",/en/obituaries/
France links 2024 Olympic smear campaign to Azerbaijan,"    According to a report by French government watchdog Viginum, a 'coordinated maneuver' by around 90 accounts with links to Azerbaijan shared 'visuals calling for a boycott of the 2024 Olympics' on July 26 and 27. ","Paris has linked Azerbaijani figures to a disinformation campaign aimed at tarnishing France's reputation as host of the 2024 Olympic Games, according to a report seen by Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Monday, November 13. France is pulling out all the stops to host the Olympic Games, which will take place from July 26 to August 11.According to a report from French state digital watchdog Viginum, seen by AFP and other media on Monday, an investigation was launched in late July after ""several visuals calling for a boycott of the 2024 Olympics"" were widely shared on X (formerly Twitter). The campaign featured images of riots, the city of Paris and also the logo of the Olympic Games, and involved three official X accounts of the games and two hashtags #PARIS2024 and #BOYCOTTPARIS2024, said Viginum.On July 26 and 27, more than 1,600 posts accompanied by these visuals or hashtags appeared on X. Around 90 accounts appear to be behind these posts ""suggesting artificial amplification,"" the report said. Viginum said that 40 of them were created in July 2023 and only published content calling for the boycott of the Paris Games.The probe revealed that of these 90 accounts, ""a significant proportion had at least one link to Azerbaijan"" such as a photo featuring the Azerbaijani flag, Azerbaijani locations, or excerpts from speeches of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. Misspelled place names – Bordo instead of Bordeaux or Monpelye instead of Montpellier – were another ""marker of inauthenticity,"" the report said.The watchdog has also identified an account at the origin of the online content targeting the Games. The account @MuxtarYev published 15 visuals calling for a boycott, which were then amplified by inauthentic accounts and picked up by X accounts linked to Azerbaijan – a pattern that ""reinforces the hypothesis of a coordinated maneuver,"" Viginum said. Created in June 2023, the @MuxtarYev account claims to be located in Azerbaijan.The name Muxtar Nagiyev and the account's profile photo coincide with the identity of the chairman of the Sabail district organization of the New Azerbaijan party, the ex-Soviet country's ruling party. According to the report, Azerbaijani national Orkhan Rzayev, who runs two companies including Mediamark Digital, could also be linked to the smear campaign.Diplomatic tensions have simmered between France and Azerbaijan, with the ex-Soviet country accusing Paris of supporting its arch-enemy Armenia and pursuing a policy of ""militarisation"" in the South Caucasus.",/en/pixels/
"'Le Monde,' a generalist and independent media","    'Le Monde' guarantees its readers ""high-quality, accurate, verified and balanced information"" in its digital and printed media. The principle of editorial independence is fiercely defended by the newspaper's 500 journalists. ","Le Monde is a French general news media that reports on international, national, economic and cultural news. With more than 500 journalists around the world, the news staff of Le Monde provides the most exhaustive coverage of current events possible on its media platforms. Le Monde can be read in its print editions, on its websites, on its apps and on social media.Le Monde was founded in 1944, at the end of World War ll, by journalist Hubert Beuve-Méry. Since its creation, it has occupied a singular place in the French media landscape. It strives, according to Le Monde Group's code of ethics charter, to offer ""high-quality, accurate, verified and balanced information."" It seeks to cover all aspects of public life through its writing staff of generalist and specialist journalists as well as its network of foreign correspondents. Its editorial line is based on expertise, investigation and education.Le Monde defends humanist and progressive values. It supports democracy against all forms of authoritarianism. It is pro-European and defends human rights and civil liberties, the pluralism of ideas and respect for the environment. It is not linked to any political party. Its editorials, which are not signed, are the opinion of the entire editorial staff. It strives to keep public debate alive, notably by publishing opinion pieces written by people outside the editorial staff. In reading Le Monde, the reader is empowered to freely form an opinion.The editorial independence of Le Monde has always been protected. Its capital was controlled for decades by its employees, and in particular its journalists, united within the Société des rédacteurs du Monde (SRM), the company's largest shareholder until 2010. Facing financial difficulties at that time, Le Monde  called on outside shareholders, who became the majority holders of its capital: Pierre Bergé (who died in 2017), Xavier Niel and Matthieu Pigasse.Upon arrival, these shareholders signed a charter of ethics guaranteeing the newspaper's complete editorial freedom. Specifically, they agreed to ""not take part in editorial choices"" and ""refrain from commissioning an article and from giving instructions to modify an article or prevent its publication."" An ethics and professional conduct committee, chaired by an outside figure, was formed to ensure that these principles were properly applied.The heads of Le Monde and the SRM are the guarantors of compliance with this charter. The SRM also has the power to validate or not — by a vote that must have a qualified majority of 60% — the appointment of the director of the newspaper, put forward every six years by the shareholders. The current director, Jérôme Fenoglio, was appointed in 2015 and was reappointed in 2021 for six years.Le Monde journalists remain minority shareholders in Le Monde Group through their participation in Le Monde Group Independence Division, an organization created in 2010 that brings together the group's staff associations as well as the Society of Readers of Le Monde. Principally, the organization has the power to block entry into the group's capital by a new player that does not respect the balance established between the staff associations and the company's shareholders.",/en/about-us/

Secret payments cast doubt on Abramovich era at Chelsea,Investigation,"More than a year after the forced departure of Roman Abramovich, skeletons are still lurking in Chelsea's closets. The veil is gradually being lifted on the practices of the Russian oligarch who ruled the London soccer club for 20 years.The Cyprus Confidential investigation has revealed the existence of a slush fund used to pay several key figures in the club's entourage. Until now, these payments were confidential. They were made via offshore companies and are likely to have breached the financial fair play rules introduced to ensure fairness between European clubs.Roman Abramovich, 57, is a multi-faceted character. He's an oil-rich multi-billionaire, patron of the arts, diplomat in the shadows, close to Vladimir Putin, and he was also one of the major figures in football for two decades. It was he who brought Chelsea back to the forefront of the European scene after buying the club in 2003 for £140 million. Beset by economic sanctions following the war in Ukraine, the oligarch was forced to sell the club in 2022 for €5 billion to a group led by Todd Boehly, co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team.An opaque financial center, a haven for Russian money, a grey zone for the cyber economy: The Cyprus Confidential investigation tells the story of how Cyprus, a small Mediterranean island, has allowed itself to be overwhelmed by its offshore industry, and has become the European Union's weak link in the fight against dubious financial flows.The investigation is based on the leak of 3.6 million confidential documents from six Cypriot financial services firms (ConnectedSky, Cypcodirect Corporate Services, DJC Accountants, Kallias & Associates, MeritKapital and MeritServus) and the i-Cyprus company register. The leaks were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and the German investigative outlet Paper Trail Media, with the support of Distributed Denial of Secrets, a group of activists campaigning for transparency. The leaks were then shared with 69 international news organizations, including Le Monde.After taking over the club, Boehly quickly alerted the football league's financial authorities to the ""incomplete financial reporting"" during the Abramovich era, without making any further details public.The Cyprus Confidential data leak now seems to provide part of the answer. Internal documents from MeritServus, a firm specializing in the provision of offshore services in Cyprus, consulted by Le Monde and its partners, show that Abramovich repeatedly supplemented his club to pay several tens of millions of euros to agents, talent scouts and owners of rival clubs, using his own resources.In 2017, for example, an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, owned by oligarch Conibair Holdings, signed a contract to pay £10 million (€11.2 million at the time) to the Italian agent Federico Pastorello. On the same day, it was announced that Antonio Conte had renewed his contract as Chelsea coach. Yet several sources indicated that Pastorello was Conte's agent at the time. Was the payment to Conibar Holdings a way of disguising the commission he took on the contract? Pastorello refused to explain these transactions or confirm that he represented the coach at the time, saying only that this is not currently the case.A few years earlier, Abramovich may have used similar methods to buy the playmaker Eden Hazard for the Blues. In March 2013, a few months after the Belgian international's official signing, his agent John Bico Penaque signed a contract with Leiston Holdings, another shell company owned by the oligarch in the British Virgin Islands, for services ""related to sports research and consultancy."" Once again, the justification behind the €6.5 million payment to the agent raises questions. When contacted, Bico Penaque did not respond.",/en/les-decodeurs/
Welcome to 'Le Monde' in English!,    'Le Monde' has launched a new English language digital edition. It will consist of translated versions of a diverse selection of articles produced by the editorial team. ,"Le Monde has reached a new milestone in its history. Thursday, April 7, sees the birth of Le Monde in English, a digital edition that offers English-speaking readers translated versions of many of the articles published each day on Le Monde.fr. There are two central objectives with this project. The first is to offer a French and European vision of current events to the English-speaking world. The second is to provide a new platform to showcase the work of Le Monde's editorial staff and, in so doing, to broaden the range of our subscribers.The idea of developing a digital version of Le Monde in English was first raised a few years ago. But another option was chosen at the time: to become more established in the French-speaking world and position Le Monde as a reference media. This is how Le Monde Afrique was launched in early 2015 and it has continued to develop ever since. This particular editorial effort toward the French-speaking world remains high on Le Monde's agenda. Two new correspondent positions in Brussels and Montreal will be created in coming months.But as early as February 2015, two articles translated into English were also published on Le Monde.fr, on the occasion of the release of ""SwissLeaks,"" an international investigation undertaken by Le Monde into an international tax evasion scheme set up by the Swiss subsidiary of the HSBC bank.Following this, a varied selection of editorial content in English started to appear on Le Monde's website: a video about the first seasons of the Game of Thrones series, a newspaper editorial warning about the effects of Brexit, entitled ""Britain beware, Brexit could be your Waterloo!,"" an appeal by Le Monde's journalists and prominent personalities to guarantee the editorial independence of the newsroom by granting it right of approval in the event of a change in the controlling shareholder of the publishing company...There was a dramatic change of pace in Le Monde's English ambitions on January 8, 2022. Gilles Paris, who has been head of the paper's international department and Washington correspondent from 2014 to 2021, wrote the first of his new columns called ""The French Test."" Appearing daily from Monday to Saturday, this English language column untangles the complicated world of French politics in the build-up to the presidential election. At the same time, the Le Monde in English project was starting to take shape. A team was put together to prepare for the launch of the English language site before the first round of the election.The team is composed of eight journalists, six at Le Monde's Paris office and two at the newspaper's Los Angeles office. Together, they are responsible for selecting articles for translation, editing the translated versions and managing the English home page of the site. The translation is done by international agencies, with the help of an artificial intelligence tool. The selection and editing of the articles is done by native English-speaking journalists.Le Monde in English will not publish original content. It will present the translated versions of a large selection of articles proposed by Le Monde, as well as some agency wires, in order to stay up-to-date with the news. All of Le Monde's popular sections and themes will feature in the project, with the exception of a few specific subjects that are too ""French."" The publication of the English version of articles will naturally be delayed until the original French version has been translated and edited.This project will enable extensive editorial content produced daily by Le Monde's editorial staff of about 500 journalists to reach new audiences, potentially interested in the ""singular, independent and balanced view"" it takes on major international and social issues, the climate crisis and geopolitics, in the words of Le Monde's director, Jérôme Fenoglio. The challenge is an ambitious one: to carve out a place for Le Monde in an English-speaking world where there is no shortage of quality media.A newsletter featuring a selection of articles from Le Monde in English will be published every day, with three different delivery times to allow readers in each geographical zone (Americas, Europe-Africa, Asia-Oceania) to receive it in the morning. Le Monde in English will offer free access to some articles, but the entire range will only be available by subscription, with rates varying according to geographical zones. Subscribers to the Intégrale, Famille or print edition of Le Monde have automatic access as part of their subscription.The objective is also commercial, as Le Monde has set itself the goal of reaching one million subscribers (all media combined) by 2025. ""With this investment, our ambition is to extend the growth of our digital subscriber portfolio and to ensure that our international audience will eventually reach nearly a quarter of all our subscribers,"" explains Louis Dreyfus, chairman of Le Monde's board of directors. Le Monde passed the half-million subscriber mark for the first time in its history in December 2021.",/en/about-us/
Groupe Le Monde's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct,"    This Code came into effect on Tuesday, 2 November 2010. ","The purpose of this Code is to recall the essential principles of independence, freedom and reliability of information, and to specify the rights and obligations of journalists, executives, and shareholders. It will be binding on the parties (organizations or associations of journalists of the various titles, shareholders, Groupe Le Monde executives, directors of publications and newsrooms), and will be included in the articles of association of Groupe Le Monde companies. In the event of a change in leadership of one of the group's titles, it will be imposed in identical terms on their new editorial and publishing directors.This Code, which is shared by all Groupe Le Monde publications and sites, is an addition to the charters and agreements previously adopted by each of these titles. These texts, which are joined in an appendix to this Code, remain fully valid with the only exception of any of their provisions that may be contradictory with those of the present Code. Any change to this Code must be approved by a vote of the publications and is effective only in those publications that have actually approved it.The vocation of Groupe Le Monde's titles is to provide, across all media, high-quality, accurate, verified and balanced information. Journalists must look at the news with a critical eye and reflect the pluralism of opinions.Journalists have the means needed to carry out their work with attention to detail, to collect and verify information, independently of any external pressure. They refrain from manipulation and plagiarism, do not spread hearsay, and avoid sensationalism, approximations and bias. They must avoid any ties of interest with the actors in the sectors they report on, and undertake to declare any conflict of interest.The ethical principles shared by the newsrooms of Groupe Le Monde will be set out in an appendix to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, without any distinction in value or legal force with the content of the latter.The editorial independence of Groupe Le Monde’s newspapers from its shareholders, advertisers, public, political, economic, ideological and religious authorities is the necessary condition for a free press and high-quality reporting. No text can be imposed on them, no direction can be dictated to them by an external intervention or constraint.The shareholders of Groupe Le Monde guarantee the economic independence of its titles within the meaning of the present Code, but refrain from interfering in their editorial choices and the way they handle information.The editorial policy of each title, whether in print or online, cannot be guided or influenced by the interests of advertisers, nor by those of other titles in the group. The editorial directors (or their delegates) are responsible for the editorial policy and content of their publication.Within each title of Groupe Le Monde, there is a person responsible for the title’s economic equilibrium and management, who is separate from the person responsible for the editorial content. Under no circumstances may one of these two managers make a decision that affects the other's area of responsibility without the latter's agreement.Two separate ethics and professional conduct committees, responsible respectively for the Le Monde daily newspaper, its supplements or variations, the Le Monde Interactif websites and its digital applications, on the one hand, and for all the magazines (the ""Magazines Division"") and their digital editions, on the other, are responsible for ensuring compliance with this Code.In particular, they will ensure that all the principles contained in the Declaration of the Duties and Rights of Journalists (Munich, 1971), which is essential to ensuring editorial independence and constitutes the ethical basis of the journalistic profession, are observed. These principles apply to the production of all editorial content produced by the group's newsrooms, regardless of the media used.This Code will be published in whole or in part in the various titles of the group as soon as it comes into force and will remain available in full and at any time on each of their websites.The shareholders of Groupe Le Monde hold the powers conferred on them by corporate law. In this capacity, they oversee the smooth operations of the group and its publications, and help define its strategy and areas of development. To ensure the financial and political independence of the group's titles and sites, and to guarantee their independence and freedom of expression, each of them agrees to respect the values and principles defined in this Code.The shareholders hereby attest to their commitment to the editorial independence of the group’s publications. They agree to respect this Code, as well as the specific charters in use in each of the group's newsrooms. Any new shareholder, whether majority or minority, will have to make the same commitment. The companies in Groupe Le Monde may only register movements or subscriptions of securities giving access to the capital in return for the adherence and signature of the present Code by their beneficiaries.The shareholders, their representatives and the members of the supervisory boards of Groupe Le Monde do not take part in editorial decisions. They attend editorial conferences only at the invitation of the newsroom or the newspaper's management, but may not speak at these meetings. They also refrain from commissioning an article and from giving instructions to modify an article or preventing it from being published.The shareholding structure of Groupe Le Monde will be published annually in paper and/or digital form by each of the Group's titles. At the same time, a report on the interests held by the main shareholders will also be provided.The shareholders agree not to impose commercial partnerships on the Group with companies they are shareholders in or which are tied to them through commercial relations. Similarly, they agree not to prevent or hinder similar partnerships with companies that are in competition with their own.When a shareholder of Groupe Le Monde or a company managed or owned by one of these shareholders is quoted in an article published by a title of Groupe Le Monde, this is indicated in the body of the article, in its title, or in a footnote.Shareholders and members of the supervisory boards agree to ensure that, in the context of public expression, their statements may not be taken as the opinion of Groupe Le Monde, except in the case of a communication voted on by the supervisory board.Membership in a Group Management Board is incompatible with:- a national or local elective mandate (except for municipal mandates in cities with fewer than 30,000 residents)- a management, supervisory or representative role within a political party or trade union- a final prison sentence related to the following subjects: (i) incitement to racial hatred or discrimination; (ii) illicit financing of political parties; (iii) personal injury.This Code recognizes the Declaration of the Duties and Rights of Journalists, adopted in Munich in 1971, in the following terms:Declaration of the Duties and Rights of JournalistsPreambleThe right to information, free expression and criticism is one of the most fundamental freedoms of every human being.The whole complex of duties and rights of journalists derives from this right of the public to know facts and opinions.The responsibility of journalists vis-a-vis the public has precedence over any other responsibility, in particular towards their employers and the public power.The mission to inform necessarily includes the limits journalists spontaneously impose on themselves. This is the subject of the present declaration of duties.Yet these duties can be effectively respected in the exercise of the journalist profession only if the concrete conditions of professional independence and dignity are implemented. This is the subject of the declaration of rights quoted here.Declaration of DutiesThe essential duties of the journalist in gathering, reporting on and commenting on events consist in:1) Respecting the truth no matter what consequences it may bring about to him, and this is because the right of the public is to know the truth.2) Defending the freedom of information, of commentaries and of criticism.3) Publishing only such pieces of information the origin of which is known or – in the opposite case – accompanying them with due reservations; not suppressing essential information and not altering texts and documents.4) Not making use of disloyal methods to get information, photographs and documents.5) Feeling obliged to respect the private life of people.6) Correcting any published information which has proved to be inaccurate.7) Observing professional secrecy and not divulging the source of information obtained confidentially.8) Abstaining from plagiarism, slander, defamation and unfounded accusations as well as from receiving any advantage owing to the publication or suppression of information.9) Never confusing the profession of journalist with that of advertiser or propagandist and not accepting any consideration, direct or not, from advertisers.10) Refusing any pressure and accepting editorial directives only from the leading persons in charge in the editorial office.Every journalist worthy of that name deems it his duty faithfully to observe the principles stated above.Within the general law of each country, the journalist recognizes, in professional matters, the jurisdiction of his colleagues only; he excludes every kind of interference by governments or others.Declaration of Rights1) Journalists claim free access to all information sources, and the right to freely inquire on all events conditioning public life.Therefore, secrecy of public or private affairs may be opposed only to journalists in exceptional cases and for clearly expressed motives.2) The journalist has the right to refuse subordination to anything contrary to the general policy of the information organ to which he collaborates such as it has been laid down in writing and incorporated in his contract of employment, as well as any subordination not clearly implicated by this general policy.3) A journalist cannot be compelled to perform a professional act or to express an opinion contrary to his convictions or his conscience.4) The editorial staff has obligatorily to be informed on all important decisions which may influence the life of the enterprise.It should at least be consulted before a definitive decision on all matters related to the composition of the editorial staff, e.g. recruitment, dismissals, mutations and promotion of journalists, is taken.5) Taking into account his functions and responsibilities, the journalist is entitled not only to the advantages resulting from collective agreements but also to an individual contract of employment, ensuring the material and moral security of his work as well as a wage system corresponding to his social condition and guaranteeing his economic independenceIn each of Groupe Le Monde's titles, whether in print or digital format, as well as in their supplements or special issues, editorial space and advertising or promotional space must be clearly and unambiguously marked.

Groupe Le Monde: 2021 yields profitable results and new investments,"    After a profitable fiscal year in 2021 thanks to a solid business model, our group will continue to invest in 2022, with the objective of further expanding its scope. ","For several years now, we have been in the habit of publicly sharing the economic situation of the Groupe Le Monde, the development of the company's profitability, its successes and its difficulties. We also want to report on the challenges we are facing and to which we must provide solid and sustainable solutions in order to strengthen our independence and the quality of our editorial production.The Ukrainian conflict and the end of the presidential campaign understandably boosted the paid circulation of several of our publications. Thanks to a jump in the number of digital subscribers, Le Monde recorded another increase in its paid circulation in France, while Courrier International saw its newsstand circulation rise by 33% since the beginning of the year. At the same time, M Publicité's revenue marked a clear recovery, up 12% at the end of April compared with the same period last year. Traffic on Le Monde's website and app is also up sharply: on the days of the presidential election's two rounds, our cumulative audience of close to 45 million visits once again placed us at the top of the news website rankings.And yet this growth in our activity, which follows on from the year 2021 in which the Groupe Le Monde recorded improved results, is already threatened by the sharp rise in our production costs. Indeed, like many economic sectors, our industry is experiencing very high cost inflation due to rising energy prices and the doubling of paper prices in the space of a year – in addition to recent supply difficulties. These shortages are the result of two phenomena. Firstly, the rise in electricity prices, with pulp mills being a major consumer of electricity. Secondly, the scarcity of paper production capacity, with many mills having closed or switched to the manufacturing of cardboard packaging, which is used in large quantities in online sales. One figure is particularly striking: in 2022, the rise in paper costs will cost our group 7 million euros, which represents two-thirds of our 2021 net income.In the context described above, this goal is essential. This is what we have been striving to do since the first quarter of 2022. For our group, the year began with the acquisition of the majority shares of the Le HuffPost website from BuzzFeed, having held 34% of the capital since its creation in 2012. Le Monde Group now owns 85% of this news site's capital, which has achieved economic stability and totals nearly 35 million monthly visits (up 30% from March 2021), with an editorial staff of 35 journalists.At the beginning of the year, we also focused on editorial innovations, on the one hand with the launch of Le Goût de M, a quarterly magazine designed by the teams of M Le Magazine du Monde, and on the other hand with the creation of Le Monde in English, an English-language version of Le Monde's editorial production, in the form of a news website. This project, supported by our shareholders, has been prepared intensively over the past six months and launched a few days before the first round of the presidential election. It aims to give English-speaking audiences access to nearly two-thirds of Le Monde's editorial production, which is translated by professional translators and edited by a team of journalists recruited for this project. The English-speaking world is the one in which the use of digital subscriptions is the most developed, as demonstrated by the success of The New York Times and The Washington Post.We are convinced that some of these readers, not only in the United States but also in many countries in Europe, Africa and Asia, may be interested in a different view of French, European and international news, in our coverage of social transformations, of the economy and the climate crisis that all our countries must face, as well as in our coverage of culture and the changes in our lifestyles. In each of these areas, Le Monde has significantly strengthened its resources, increasing its editorial staff from 310 to 520 journalists on permanent contracts over 11 years. With this project, Le Monde is increasing its ability to reach our objective of 1 million digital subscribers by 2025 and, more broadly, to offer a European alternative to avid news followers.It is primarily because its results in 2021 demonstrated the renewed strength of its business model that Le Monde can sustain its investment budgeted at 3 million euros per year. Last year, the Groupe Le Monde recorded an operating income of 18.4 million euros and a net income of 9.5 million euros. This restored financial strength is the result of a profound transformation of our business model and the now predominant weight of income coming from our readers, amounting to 70% of our total revenue. This growth in our circulation was recognized last month by the ACPM (Alliance pour les chiffres de la presse et des médias, the Alliance for Press and Media Figures). For the second year in a row, it awarded Courrier International one star for its strong growth in paid circulation, and Le Monde three stars to reward both the growth in its digital audience, the growth of its paid circulation and the consistency of its growth over the last five years.Among its revenue sources, the growth of Le Monde's digital subscriptions will reach 48 million euros for 2021 – 28% of the Société Editrice du Monde's revenue, or 16% of our group's total revenue. For the first time in a long time, the Société Editrice du Monde has registered an operating profit, enabling it to reinvest in development projects, but also to support the digital developments of our magazine division. Finally, among the efforts of which we are particularly proud, it should be noted that the success of Le Monde's digital developments was achieved while we also  reduced our carbon footprint by more than 20% in 2021. Building sustainable and responsible growth is also a requirement upon which we insist.In the coming months, new digital video and audio formats will be developed by Courrier International, Télérama and Malesherbes Publications. They aim to acquire new audiences and build a relationship with the younger generations, through platforms such as Snapchat, TikTok, Spotify and YouTube. We are convinced that this is where young people are used to sharing, and often finding, information. As such, we must start playing our role as a media outlet producing reliable and independent information, adapted to these new modes of expression, without ever compromising the quality of our journalism. This relationship of trust can then be translated into enjoying content in more traditional formats. This early development of young readers' loyalty is already producing visible effects among our subscriber readers, whose average age has been falling steadily for three years.The year 2021 also saw the first so-called ""neighboring rights"" agreements put in place, within the framework of the July 24, 2019 law, which created this particular right for press agencies and press publishers. Its retroactive effectiveness to October 2019 gives the main press publishers new means of financing their investments and the transformation of their models. In accordance with the law, the Groupe Le Monde has begun discussions with trade unions to agree on an amount that would be paid to its journalists.With this positive net income, our group is slowly rebuilding its equity. Since 2010, with the support of our shareholders and by using the group's teams, we have been able to gradually build our economic model and restore our financial autonomy, while strictly respecting our editorial freedom. Our once again profitable results reflect this joint effort. In 2021, out of a total turnover of 307 million euros, the share of public subsidies remained marginal, amounting to 2.6 million euros, to which 600,000 euros of support was added after the liquidation of our distributor, Presstalis.Finally, in parallel with the turnaround of the group's accounts, the year 2021 saw further progress in simplifying our shareholding structure around two structural features: the Fonds pour l’Indépendance de la Presse (Fund for the Independence of the Press), which is intended to bring together all of the shares held directly or indirectly up to that point by shareholder Xavier Niel, and the Pôle d’Indépendance (Independence Hub), which brings together the shares held by the staff companies, La Société des Lecteurs du Monde (Le Monde Readers' Society) and the founders of Le Monde. Indeed, at the beginning of this year, Xavier Niel indicated that he had acquired 49% of the company LNM from Matthieu Pigasse, a 26.6% shareholder of Le Monde Libre, and that he would also contribute these shares to the Fund for the Independence of the Press in order to strengthen the weight of the endowment fund in the capital of our group.The strength of our results and this increased stability of our capital constitute a solid foundation for continuing to elevate our group to new heights. In this period of major events – the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the climate crisis and the various French elections – this indispensable foundation would not be sufficient if it were not reinforced by the most precious form of support: your trust. You have shown it through the number of subscriptions in recent months, but also by the strength of the testimonials you have sent us. We recognize the demands of that support; how much you expect us to provide journalism that lives up to the intense upheavals that are shaking our world and our lives. Rest assured that we will continue to make every effort to prove ourselves worthy, day after day, of this trust.",/en/about-us/
"'Online commentators do not question the facts presented by journalists, they contest their interpretations'","    In an interview with 'Le Monde,' sociologists Luc Boltanski and Arnaud Esquerre present the conclusions of their survey on news-focused online comments, and in particular those published on LeMonde.fr. ","The latest book by sociologists Luc Boltanski and Arnaud Esquerre, Qu'est-ce que l'actualité politique ? (What is Political News?"") looks at the main ""events and opinions of the 21st century."" As part of this work, the two researchers had access, among other things, to the 120,000 comments submitted in September and October 2019 by Le Monde subscribers on the newspaper's website, whether they were either published or rejected. (About one-sixth of them did not comply with the charter for digital contributions.)Luc Boltanski: At the time, I was trying to explore the concept of ""scandal."" I had access to a collection of about 300 letters addressed to Le Monde's readers' mail by people who condemned what they considered an injustice and talked about their ""scandal."" The collection of 120,000 contributions we worked on this time is quite different.Arnaud Esquerre: The big difference between paper letters and online commentaries is that more than 80% of online comments are published, which was not the case with the letters. The other big difference, which we did not expect, is that these online comments very rarely mention personal causes and are focused on current events. This is not to say that they do not contain hints about the private lives of these contributors. But they are presented within the context of an interpretation of the facts contained in the articles that is different from the one given by the journalist.L.B.: People who are no longer very young, primarily men from the middle and upper class, who are politically troubled because they have a hard time connecting their feelings to their newspaper's political position and their former position, which they no longer remember very well. We can see in some of them a form of ""desolation,"" to use a term found in Hannah Arendt's work, a disconnect between what we believe in and the world of action.A.E.: We initially thought that people at the margin would be more likely to question the facts and believe in conspiracies, yet we didn't find that at all. The readers do not question the facts presented by the journalists, but they do contest their interpretations. For them, Le Monde is a quasi-institution, a newspaper that guarantees the truth of the facts, and they are very attached to this aspect. Another surprise is that we expected to find insults and defamatory language. The opposite appeared: a very conscientious writing style and a lot of care given to the choice of arguments.",/en/about-us/
One year of 'Le Monde' in English,"    Since its launch in April 2022, the English edition of 'Le Monde' has offered a selection of articles that reflect the richness of the French editorial staff's journalism. ","Translate all of 'Le Monde' into English. Simply put, that's the goal we set for ourselves on the eve of the launch of the English edition of Le Monde just one year ago, on April 7, 2022. Since then, we've published more than 13,000 articles, 72% of which are translations of Le Monde articles, with the remaining 28% being news agency wire stories that keep the English-language version, on top of the news at all times. Today, Le Monde's little sister, as we happen to call her because of her small, mostly female team, is nothing short of an English-language news site that reflects the high standards and richness of Le Monde's journalism, in all formats and media: whether it's text, video or long forms from the website, the print newspaper, or the magazine.The translation of articles selected by the editorial staff is carried out by two American agencies that work from a first draft produced by an artificial intelligence tool. The journalists responsible for the English edition then check the articles, adding the contextual elements that are sometimes necessary to properly understand the issues being covered. The English team comes from all over the world and is based in Paris and Los Angeles.In these times of social conflict, Le Monde in English has spent much of 2023 covering President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform. Through the selection of articles we offer in English, we want to give our foreign readers the keys to understanding what makes pensions such a sensitive issue in France.These include political stakes on the reform − for the majority as well as for the opposition − and others on the reasons for protesting a bill that's considered ""unfair,"" especially for women and those who feel that it does not fully take into account the hardship of a job and its impact on workers' health over time. We also covered marches around the country, reporting on youth participation and how some demonstrations became violent after the bill was forced through the Assemblée Nationale using Article 49.3 of the French Constitution. This topic was also an opportunity to decipher some French specificities such as the thorny issue of counting demonstrators and the functioning of Article 49.3. We also took a detour into the unresolved issue of the employment of senior citizens and the changing relationship that young people have to work. The next deadline, that of the Constitutional Council's ruling on the bill (to which we have also dedicated an article), will also be followed closely in English.Le Monde in English has an undeniably French slant. But its editorial line is similar to that of Le Monde, so we don't only report on France. On another major news topic, the war in Ukraine, we published nearly 1,800 articles over the past year. Our coverage combines reports from our special correspondents − who cover front-line and Ukrainian society −  as well as geopolitical-focused columns and opinion pieces. Our video investigation on how French retailer Auchan contributed to the Russian war effort was especially popular among our English-speaking readers in the United Kingdom, the United States and France, as well as in Poland and Ukraine.Le Monde is also on top of the latest trends in fashion, culture and gastronomy. All of these topics are covered in our English edition, which has a French Delights section listing recommendations for French exhibitions, shows and restaurants. And let's not forget what we could call ""all things French,"" lighter articles on Unesco honoring the French baguette or whether writing ""the French"" can be considered ""dehumanizing,"" as the reputable American news agency AP has deemed.The majority of our readers read Le Monde in English from the US, but a large proportion is also in Canada and the UK. To a lesser extent, we have European, Australian and Indian readers. The profile of readers who subscribe to read all of Le Monde in English follows the same trend: A majority are in the States but Japan, Lithuania and Bermuda are also represented, giving even wider visibility to the work of Le Monde's editorial staff, the other objective set at the time of the launch.Read more about how we work and our editorial vision, and take our quiz to test your translation and French politics know-how.",/en/about-us/

Le Monde presents the Adaptation project,News,"The word ""adaptation"" has seeped into public discourse like the catchy title of a futuristic novel or a successful disaster-themed TV show would. But climate change is neither fiction nor the future. France is facing the challenge of the century: adapting to global warming, which could cause temperatures in mainland France to rise by 4°C by 2100, according to one scenario that the government now deems ""realistic"". The paradox of that horizon is that it is worrying, but still a long way off. Make no mistake though: The task of adaptation is an emergency for the present.There is no longer a question of arguing about the origins of the great climate disruption underway, or the speed at which we should reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides two clear answers. Humans are responsible (the rich countries more so than the poor ones). And regarding the trajectory toward carbon neutrality, there is only one vital rule: the sooner, the better.Nevertheless, no matter what decisions are made in the coming years, we will have to live with this reality: The planet is warming at an unprecedented rate, and France, because of its geographical position, is warming faster than the global average. The profound transformation of our country is not an option, it's an imperative. There is no plan B. Only plan A: adaptation.Squaring up to the challenge of adapting France to global warming is like plunging your gaze into a bottomless pit of questions. It would be quicker to list the sectors that won't be affected: There are virtually none. Le Monde is publishing an 11-chapter exploration of the challenges facing the country, starting with the ecosystems most affected – forests, mountains – and the regions most threatened by submersion: overseas island territories, whose very existence, in some cases, are at stake.Our reporters also visited the Rhône river, which is so crucial to the country's energy grid; the southern Occitania region, where they observed the evolution of agriculture and the great transformation of our landscapes; and the ports of Brittany, a region that you might mistakenly think will be relatively unscathed. They documented the mosquito invasion, and they put themselves in the shoes of children to look at how schools will have to be rethought. They examined the key role of insurance in a world where today's extremes will become tomorrow's norms, and looked into the 1,300 French factories where accidents would cause major hazards, most of which were built at a time when the climate risk was non-existent. A thousand more topics would have been possible.The Adaptation project was open to the entire editorial staff at Le Monde, to ensure the broadest possible points of view. In all, over 100 people took part. Some 70 journalists were involved: reporters who crisscrossed the country from February to June, along with department heads, editors and proofreaders. Some 30 photographers, videographers and illustrators helped capture the visible traces of global warming and the adaptation that has begun at the local level. Some 15 graphic artists and members of the design team worked on producing the project. We all worked toward the same goal: finding the right formats to convey, through words, images and graphics, the immensity of the challenge and the urgency for action.Le Monde investigates the countless challenges that France faces across sectors to adapt to global warming.Find all the articles from our series here",/en/about-us/
Adaptation project: How Le Monde calculated the carbon footprint of its reporting,"    In the face of rapid climate change caused by human activity, it is our collective responsibility to measure and question the impact of how we travel. ","The planet is not in danger. Earth has seen it all before. It's the survival of the living world as we know it – plants, animals, the human species – that's at stake in the fight against massive climate disruption, a phenomenon that is accelerating at an unprecedented speed.It is we humans who are causing this change in the climate, through our extreme dependence on fossil fuels for food, transport, heating, clothing and entertainment. As part of Le Monde's Adaptation project, running from June 11 to July 16, in which we explore how France is adapting to the here-and-now impact of climate change, we decided to calculate the carbon footprint of the transportation needed for our reporting for this project.One immediate observation is that transportation accounts for only a small share of greenhouse gas emissions by the Le Monde Group. The last calculation, in 2019, put the figure at 5%. This is far behind the manufacturing of the newspaper and its distribution, at 65%, and the digital use of its content, at 24%.Still, we have a collective responsibility to be conscious of the impact of a 200-kilometer trip by gasoline-powered car (66 kg of CO₂ equivalent – 'CO2e' – emitted), or a 6,700 km plane journey to Guadeloupe (1,033 kg of CO2e emitted), compared to more sustainable transport such as the train (1.2 kg of CO2e for a 430 km Paris-Lyon train). These figures should be set against our individual ""carbon credit"" to avoid a warming of more than 1.5°C – this is estimated at 317 tonnes over the lifetime of a person born in 1986, according to experts at the Carbon Brief climate science and policy website.Such awareness is the primary objective in calculating the carbon footprint of our Adaptation reporting. This, of course, means awareness on the part of Le Monde journalists, although many were already well informed – whether through personal conviction, through the mountains of alarming reports received from scientists, or through the Climate Fresk exercise deployed within the group over the last few months, in which this French NGO distributed cards to use in teamwork exercises, to be placed in the correct order to represent the chain of events causing and caused by climate change.It also means raising awareness among our readers. Transport alone accounts for 35% of French emissions, the highest of any sector, and this is mainly from private cars – for both business and personal travel. The use of petrol, gas, coal and methane has consequences for the living world, so it's vital that its use is systematically questioned.First of all, it should be clarified that this is not an official carbon footprint, according to the method used by companies to compile a complete carbon inventory, which must include multiple emission elements in order to assess the company's dependence on fossil fuels and areas for improvement.For a complete carbon footprint of the reporting for the Adaptation project  – following the precise methodology outlined by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME)  – it would have been necessary to include the carbon footprint of all equipment used, food consumed and type of accommodation used by the journalists in the course of their work. For this assessment, we are dealing solely with the transport element.Each journalist recorded their journeys in a spreadsheet prepared by the Le Monde editorial development team, based on a model used by the Le Monde video service for its Plan B series of video explainers on climate disruption. Each journey was then assessed using the estimated carbon footprint of different modes of transport according to the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME).The aim was to obtain orders of magnitude for the carbon footprint, and we're conscious of the limits of these calculations.These are all elements we'll try to improve on for more precise future calculations. In addition, modes of transport that emit very little or zero carbon (walking, cycling, electric bikes) have been used, but not always accounted for. It would be interesting to include them in future in order to track their evolution over time.At the time of writing, not all reporting trips for the project have been completed, since the copy is due in June for stories published in July, so we can't yet give complete figures. This article will be updated in mid-July.There was a single exception: two journalists rented an electric car for their local travel. Electric cars are still relatively difficult to hire outside big cities, but this is certainly an area for improvement in the near future.Question the journey. The first and most essential step is to question the necessity of a journey. Can we avoid it? Could we postpone it and combine it with other activities? This could mean using local correspondents instead of sending a reporter from elsewhere, or waiting and shooting several stories at the same location rather than traveling for the sake of one story. This is a principle that can be equally applied to daily life – not making a round trip by car to the bakery if it's far away, for example, but grouping it with another errand, or going on the way back from work.Integrating less polluting modes of transport into the daily routine. When travel is necessary, the car is still king for short journeys. It's logical and often indispensable when a workplace is relatively far from home or public transport options are lacking. Still, according to INSEE, 56% of home-to-work journeys of less than two kilometers – a distance usually feasible on foot or by bike – were made by car in 2017, at the cost of a heavy carbon footprint, not to mention the cost of gasoline. Walking, cycling (which can be electric) or public transport, depending on existing infrastructure, should be the preferred options for short daily journeys.Avoiding cars for long journeys. As researcher Aurélien Bigo pointed out in a recent episode of the podcast Chaleur Humaine (""Human Warmth""), 1.2% of journeys over 80 kilometers from home represent 40% of the total kilometers traveled in France – and therefore have a very heavy carbon footprint. The train is by far the best solution for crossing the country, even if it means renting a car for the last few kilometers, and this could be an electric car. The catch, however, is that the prices of both train travel and electric car rentals need to decrease significantly in order to make them financially viable solutions for all.",/en/about-us/
How 'Le Monde' in English translates between language and culture,"    As Le Monde's English edition moves into its second year, our team takes you through the process of translating not only words but also culture from French to English. ","When Le Monde in English was launched in April 2022, the goal was to provide a ""French and European vision of current events to the English-speaking world"" by translating articles from across Le Monde's coverage of events happening in France and around the world. The small team of editors is faced with the daily challenge of not only literally translating between languages but also across cultures, explaining the uniquely French expressions and sociopolitical concepts, (many) historical references and literary flourishes that shape Le Monde's journalism.Now publishing about 40 articles a day, we rely on artificial intelligence technology to provide instant translations that are then edited by professional outside translation agencies. Our daily team of four to five English-speaking editors in Paris and Los Angeles then fine-tunes the final product, particularly adding in necessary context for non-French readers while remaining true to the original French text. As German novelist Günter Grass once said, ""Translation is that which transforms everything so that nothing changes.""The task of not only accurate but fluent translation is particularly important in a country like France, which values its language so much it has a whole Académie dedicated to preserving it. While the foundation of answering ""who, what, where, when and so what"" in a new story exists across borders, one of our most striking challenges is adopting the unique style of French journalism. Compared to the English-language press, French media outlets are much more indulgent about slowly guiding the reader into a story, often with whole paragraphs setting the scene before revealing what it's actually about. Influences from creative writing are more commonly indulged, including unique second mentions (President Emmanuel Macron is the ""tenant of the Elysée"") and many references from literature and the Classics that often test a reader's (and an English editor's) knowledge: As one example, the French leader is also commonly referred to as ""Jupiter,"" the supreme god of Roman mythology to which he compared himself.Le Monde in English experienced a baptême de feu launching the website at the same time as the 2022 French presidential election, pitting Macron (and his Macronie) against a slew of candidates in the first round. We quickly developed our own style guide (now 30+ pages) and translations for the unique language of the French political world, such as far-right leader Marine Le Pen's tentative de dédiabolisation (literally ""de-demonizing attempt""), her efforts to become ""normalized"" or ""mainstreamed"", especially compared to her far-right rival Eric Zemmour, infamous for promoting the ""Grand Remplacement"" (""Great Replacement,"" a racist conspiracy theory that White populations are being replaced by foreign migrants). During the second round – Macron against Le Pen – we explained why many on the left chose le vote blanc, leaving their ballot blank, or le vote utile, voting for Macron only to prevent Le Pen's far-right policies from winning – we chose to describe this as ""strategic voting."" In the end, Macron partly benefited from the front républicain, the customary alliance of parties or voters to prevent far-right victories.Following the summer's legislative elections, when voters once again went to the urne (the French word for ballot box is also used in the funeral sense) and the well-deserved August vacances, it was time for the rentrée, a phrase referring both to students returning to school and grown-ups to work. We dived into how Macron's second quinquennat (five-year term) would shape up differently now that he no longer had an absolute majority in the hémicycle, or chamber, of the Assemblée Nationale, France's lower house of Parliament. Macron continued to put forward his en même temps approach (literally ""at the same time""), a refrain commonly used for positioning himself as a unifying centrist.To better understand the current socio-political moment, many Le Monde journalists are quick to add historical context to their pieces, such as to the Trente Glorieuses (a period of post-WW II economic growth from 1945 to 1975) and the prevailing influence of Gaullisme (a reference to the general turned president Charles de Gaulle). As Le Monde in English journalists, we strive to provide context for these references that might not always be evident to non-French readers. Although to keep the flow of the writing, we try to do this as succinctly as possible (as you might have noticed with the heavy use of parentheses throughout this article).And we have never shied away from getting into the weeds of what is franco-français (""quintessentially French"") and the particularities of the millefeuille territorial (a confectionary reference to the country's system of territorial administrative divisions).Our translation skills were truly put to the test with this year's pension reform, which has garnered significant international attention, particularly given the viral imagery of French cities on fire and garbage piling up with collectors en grève (""on strike""). We have strived to deliver both the nuanced coverage that only local journalists can provide, on the ground in the cortèges (""processions"") of the manif (short for manifestation, or ""demonstration"") while also adding in the necessary context for what is a complicated piece of legislation: In addition to finding translations for pénibilité (workplace hardship) or social (meaning social or economic, depending on the context), we also had to explain the significance of raising the retirement age in a country that so values its labor rights. And we've had a bit of fun along the way, explaining some of the movement's most entertaining and impactful slogans and chants.Some of our liveliest moments in the office are when we debate how we will explain a new polémique (""controversy""), whether it is a vieux serpent de mer (a long-standing but never accomplished project ) like laïcité (""secularism,"" which in French is a particularly loaded term) or related to current events, like sobriété énergétique (""energy conservation""). Sometimes, there is no perfect English equivalent and certain nuances may be lost in translation, but we appreciate the value of making Le Monde's journalism accessible to a wider audience to not only inform but forge cross-cultural understanding.Read more about how we work and our editorial vision, and take our quiz to test your translation and French politics know-how.",/en/about-us/
Quiz: Test your 'Frenglish' with Le Monde in English!,    Can you translate the trickiest expressions used in French politics and everyday life − or even by President Emmanuel Macron himself? ,"As editors for Le Monde in English, one of the most interesting parts of our job is figuring out how to convey certain French expressions in equally fluid English, a daily challenge that has led to many animated and humorous debates in the newsroom. After a year of covering current events in France and around the world − each with their own specialized vocabulary − we realized that our greatest translation difficulties arose typically with jargon from the unique world of French politics, or inventive phrases out of the mouth of the French President himself: ""Macronisms,"" as we like to say.While we've managed to codify certain translations, many remain dependent on context as well as Le Monde's specific editorial and style choices.

The top 20 articles you've read this year,"    A mix of hard news, lighter pieces and all things French: Here are the stories you've most enjoyed this year. ","Le Monde in English was launched on April 7, just in time for the 2022 French presidential election which took place on April 10 and 24. So it was a good surprise for the team to find out that the most read article of the year was the result of the election.Even Le Monde did not miss Bennifer's romantic Paris getaway. It seems you've enjoyed our column about it too.The European wave of Monkeypox – the virus was renamed mpox at the end of November by the World Health Organization (WHO) – differed from those observed in a dozen African countries, notably in the patients' profile: almost exclusively men, most of them males who have sex with males, known as ""MSM"" in the scientific community. Why are MSM overrepresented among the affected? This explainer takes a look at why that is.Two days in the life of lovers: The first when there is everything to play for, the second when everything is lost. When the ""S'aimer comme on se quitte"" column (""In and out of love"" in English) was first published in French in January 2018, it was instantly very popular and has been part of the most read articles ever since.A documentary released at the end of June broke diplomatic standards on secrecy, in the latest instance of Paris and Moscow weaponizing 'leaks.' After it aired, Russia accused France of violating ""diplomatic ethics.""After one death and several serious injuries, investigations found that the tragedies happened a few days after the children ate Buitoni's Fraîch'Up pizzas produced in the same Nestlé factory. Analyses revealed that the pizzas were contaminated by Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. The food giant was citing the ongoing preliminary investigation to avoid making any statement at the time.In early 2021, the UK newspaper The Guardian published a detailed investigation revealing that at least 6,500 migrant workers in Qatar had died between 2011 and 2020. Since then, this figure of 6,500 deaths has become central to the criticism of the 2022 World Cup organization, and many have quoted it thinking that it corresponds to the number of workers who have died on the construction sites of the competition's stadiums, or more broadly on World Cup construction sites. However, our article shows this is not quite the case.Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri was killed on July 31 in Afghanistan. Announcing his death, US President Joe Biden said little about the weapon used. Washington is reported to have used a ""ninja bomb"" equipped with six blades that deploy before impact to shred its target without any blast effect.On September 2, Timothée Chalamet set social media and Le Monde in English ablaze with his revealing scarlet suit at the Venice Film Festival.Every day, our correspondents from all over the world write a ""Letter from.""

Two major milestones for Le Monde's independence,"Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky has sold his shares in Le Monde Group to Xavier Niel, who will transfer them to a foundation. Matthieu Pigasse has announced that his own shares will also be transferred to the same foundation, making it the group's largest shareholder.","On Saturday, September 23, NJJ Presse, French businessman Xavier Niel's personal holding company, announced that it had taken over Daniel Kretinsky's shares in Le Monde Group, with the unanimous agreement of the Pôle d'indépendance (Independence Pole). He will transfer them, along with those he already holds, to the Fonds pour l'indépendance de la presse (Fund for Press Independence). This endowment fund, whose shares will henceforth be non-transferable, will thus become our group's largest shareholder. At the same time, French investment banker Matthieu Pigasse has announced that his shares in our group will also be transferred to the Fund for Press Independence. Following these transactions, the group's two main shareholders will therefore be the Fund for Press Independence (whose board of directors is chaired by Alain Frachon, former Le Monde editorial director) and the Independence Pole, mainly composed of journalist and staff associations of our group's various publications (Le Monde, Télérama, Courrier International, La Vie).These announcements represent two important milestones for our group's governance and for safeguarding the independence of our editorial teams. Kretinsky's withdrawal from our capital puts an end to a chapter that began in 2018, with his investment in Pigasse's company Le Nouveau Monde. Unsolicited, his arrival sparked an immediate and exceptional response from our community and our readers to the threat that it could pose to the balance of our ownership and the identity of our publications. This led to the creation of a statutory right of approval for the sole benefit of the Independence Pole, in the form of a vote prior to any significant change in our ownership.Since then, neither Kretinsky nor his teams have taken part in defining or implementing our strategy. Nor has Kretinsky sought approval from the Independence Pole. His withdrawal once and for all clarifies the situation within our company's capital.The involvement of our group's teams, and that of our readers, was essential during this time and led the Independence Pole, the management board and Niel to reflect on the changes needed to further protect our editorial freedom. These discussions led to the creation of the Fund for Press Independence.Since 2018, our group has thus pursued our development: in complete independence, with an acceleration in the transformation of our business model and a series of editorial developments that have enabled the readership of each of our publications to grow. An example is Le Monde's digital subscriptions portfolio, which went from 173,000 subscribers in 2018 to 503,000 in September 2023.The announcement of the transfer of Pigasse's shares will also strengthen the influence of the Fund for Press Independence. This initiative, which we applaud, is the culmination of Pigasse's considerable personal investment in supporting and accelerating the transformation of our business model. Initiator of the project with Pierre Bergé and Niel, he was instrumental in rescuing our group and recapitalizing Le Monde Libre in 2010. Pigasse has been a member of our supervisory board ever since. At every stage of our development, from the introduction of our code of ethics to the signing of the agreement granting approval to the Independence Pole, Pigasse has made major contributions to the growth of our group. We would like to thank him warmly on behalf of our group.Following these changes, and at the end of a dispute with Bergé's heir, our group's capital should be divided between the Fund for Press Independence, a foundation created to support the freedom and quality of information in our democracy, which could hold 72.5% of the group's capital, and the Independence Pole (25.4 %). At a time when many media outlets are seeing their economic stability threatened, their expertise shaken or their identity attacked, our group's evolution demonstrates that the entry of private shareholders into a publication's capital can also lead to a strengthening of editorial rights and freedoms, thanks to the oversight of its staff associations and the support of its readers.In contrast to recent and worrying developments seen elsewhere, a number of protective tools and mechanisms have been put in place in recent years, with the support of our shareholders. They include the signing of a code of ethics and professional conduct, the creation of an ethics committee gradually extended to all group entities, the right of approval to prevent any hostile change in our ownership, and the creation, in each of our publications, of a right of approval by the editorial staff prior to any departure of the editorial director, or the director of Le Monde. This recent achievement completes a system that already provided for this same right of approval at the time of appointments of editorial managers.With these protections in place, our group is more stable and better equipped to carry out its mission to inform. The consequence of this statutory independence is our economic autonomy. Having been profitable for the past seven years, thanks to the excellent results of our magazines, our group has been able to regularly reinvest its earnings in a series of developments that are now bearing fruit.These include expanding our editorial teams, with more than 540 journalists now making up Le Monde's newsroom (up from 310 in 2010), creating M, Le Monde's magazine, whose reputation and success have not waned after 12 years of existence, launching a Le Monde morning mobile app, and creating podcasts and videos on social media platforms such as YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok to strengthen our ties with younger audiences. Further developments included opening correspondent posts abroad and launching Le Monde Africa, to further affirm our interest in international issues, continuing to strengthen our capacity to cover the causes and consequences of the major climate crisis that is affecting our world, and, most recently, the launch of an English-language website and app to better share our journalism beyond France's borders. These innovations, as well as the recent advances in our guarantees of independence, are the latest milestones in Le Monde's very long history, which began in 1944 with our founder, Hubert Beuve-Méry.It's a story that reflects the values he set out to defend when he forged this fragile yet powerful weapon: an independent newspaper. We'll be celebrating our 80th anniversary together next year, convinced that this long journey owes as much to the commitment of each and every member of our company to the freedom to inform, as it does to the loyal and ever-growing support of our readers.",/en/about-us/
Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky sells Le Monde stake to Xavier Niel,"    This agreement seals the tycoon's exit from the group's capital, which he joined in 2018. His shares will be transferred by Xavier Niel to the Press Independence Fund, which thus becomes the group's largest shareholder. ","NJJ Presse, the holding company of French billionaire Xavier Niel, announced in a press release on Saturday September 23, that it had bought Daniel Kretinsky's shares in Le Monde Group.

To our readers: On Le Monde's coverage of the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza,    Le Monde looks back at the newsroom's coverage of the deadly explosion at the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza on October 17. ,"Le Monde owes its readers an explanation about our coverage of the deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday, October 17.That evening, Le Monde published an article based on an Agence France-Presse wire about the bombing of the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, attributing the strike to the Israeli army, with an initial death toll of 200. The article quickly stated that the Israeli authorities were carrying out checks and were expressing doubts about the veracity of the reports. This article appeared as the top story on our websites, both the French and English editions, as it did on other leading news sites around the world.Later in the evening, we reported the Israeli army denied being responsible for the explosion, and attributed it to a rocket fired by Islamic Jihad, an organization allied to Hamas. As the evening went on, doubts and contradictions about the explosion accumulated. We covered these in the breaking news coverage of the war on our websites and on the front page of the following day's print newspaper (dated Thursday, October 19), which ran a more general headline on the ""ordeal of the population"" in Gaza and mentioned ""several hundred civilians dead"" from the explosion at the hospital – the unverifiable death toll is currently estimated by US intelligence services to be between 100 and 300. Our reports also included Hamas's accusations and Israel's denial.On Thursday, October 19, we published an investigation by our video department which, though it does not give formal proof, assembles images and chronological elements, none of which support the theory that the Israeli army was responsible. This reporting, those by other news organizations as well as multiple expert reports tend to show, without being able to formally prove it, that the explosion at Al Ahli Arab Hospital was caused by the fall of a rocket fired from within Gaza by a Palestinian armed group.Investigations into the origin of this tragedy are ongoing, but these corroborating elements lead us to believe that we were not cautious enough, on October 17, when we reported Hamas's declaration on this explosion.Precaution is all the more necessary as, unfortunately, we do not have the means to verify information on the ground. The Israeli army bans access to Gaza, and the international press is absent. Le Monde's newsroom can only gather eyewitness accounts from civilians, via poor telephone and Internet connections, while they are under constant threat of bombardment and depend on the power supplied by Israel.After assessing the danger, it is usually up to news organizations to decide whether or not to send their reporters into a war zone. In this case, we don't have that choice.To take account of this situation, which we deplore, we will regularly remind our readers that some news coming out of the Gaza Strip, in particular casualty figures, cannot be verified. To be transparent about the origin of these figures, we have also decided to change the way we present them, by stating that they come from the health ministry in the Gaza Strip ""administered by Hamas.""Further changes in our practices may be adopted in the days to come concerning this conflict between Israel and Hamas, which is more than just another episode in the tensions that regularly inflame this region of the world.The ongoing events, since the atrocities committed by Hamas during the terrorist operation of October 7, are part of a war without mercy, which promises to be long, causing tragedies and multiple shockwaves. We owe it to your loyalty and trust to respond with the most complete and reliable editorial coverage possible.",/en/about-us/
How Louboutin fought tooth and nail for his special red,Long Read,"""Who hasn't heard of Louboutin's red soles? It's one of the most talked-about legal sagas in fashion, and rightly so: It deserves a major television series!"" said Ingrid Zafrani, a lawyer at the Paris bar specializing in intellectual property law. Since 2006, the luxury shoemaker has been engaged in a series of legal battles with many twists and turns to protect this famous and much-copied characteristic.Christian Louboutin has told the original story dozens of times, as one does with any good tale. In 1993, a prototype of a silk satin shoe arrived at his studio, sent by his Italian manufacturer. Surprised that it didn't match his sketch, the designer looked for a mistake. The piece simply seemed dull.Examining it from every angle, he realized that the sole, made of a thick black material, was not visible on the drawing. Seeing his assistant painting her nails a deep, bright red, the designer spontaneously borrowed the bottle and began painting the sole. The Louboutin red was born.From the outset, the brand was a success, far beyond expectations. American celebrities went crazy for these stilettos with their vertiginous heels and scarlet soles. Rihanna, Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Lopez (who even dedicated a song to them, ""Louboutins""), Sarah Jessica Parker – they've all flaunted their Louboutin stilettos, propelling them to pop culture status.But with success comes imitation. ""Being copied can help you become famous, but it can also ruin you! In the history of fashion, copying has always been a scourge. When you've been plagiarized, there's no other way but to defend yourself, especially when you've built your brand on a distinctive element. In Louboutin's case, his entire strategy revolves around the red sole. All his shoes have them,"" explained fashion historian Xavier Chaumette.In 2006, the shoemaker first decided to defend his creation tooth and nail. But the results didn't live up to expectations. ""Season 1 of the saga was bad, thank goodness there was a season 2,"" said Zafrani, referring to the first, unsuccessful lawsuits brought by la Maison Christian Louboutin. In France in 2012, the brand failed to defend its red sole against Zara. It accused the Spanish giant of copying one of its models, the Yoyo, an open-toe shoe with... a red sole. Citing counterfeiting, the shoe manufacturer claimed to have registered the ""Red Sole trademark"" with l’Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle (the national intellectual property office of France).",/en/lifestyle/
Paris 2024 unveils Olympic torch symbolizing equality and sustainability,"    The Paris 2024 Organizing Committee revealed the design of its main symbol on Tuesday, one year ahead of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. ","At the Tokyo summer Olympics in 2021, the torch was in the shape of a cherry blossom, right down to the pink color of its metal. At the Beijing winter Olympics in 2022, it was in the shape of a giant red and silver ribbon. At the Turin winter Olympics in 2006, it was a cross between a ski pole and the iconic building of Piedmont's capital, the Mole Antonelliana. The Turin torch won the ""Lorenzo il Magnifico"" award, the highest distinction of the Florence Biennale of Contemporary Art.Unveiled Tuesday, July 25, exactly one year and one day before the festivities kickoff, the Paris 2024 torch is domed in the center and tapering at both ends, a novel shape that might evoke the wooden spindles once used for spinning wool and lace.""Many of the Olympic torches in the history of this object – first created in 1928 in Amsterdam and further refined by Adolf Hitler for the 1936 Berlin Games – remind me of a weapon, or a club,"" said Mathieu Lehanneur, the French designer who won the tender held last winter by the Paris 2024 Organizing Committee for the design of the Olympic torch and cauldron. ""I have designed a torch that will, for the first time, be absolutely symmetrical from top to bottom, symbolizing the equality between athletes as well as equality between the Olympic and Paralympic Games, which will have one and the same emblem.""The 49-year-old internationally-renowned designer – whose work has included early pieces exhibited at New York's Museum of Modern Art and solar-lit street furniture for the COP 21 in Paris – also referenced water in his design, with a wave motif rippling over the torches.""I wanted to celebrate the Seine, the backbone of Paris, and water in general, which enables the flame to cross the Mediterranean on the famous Belem from Greece to Marseille and then to reach the capital after a sailing journey through the oceans that bathe Guadeloupe and Martinique,"" the designer added.For the production of the world's most-viewed design object, economy of materials and sustainability were a priority. Like the Tokyo torch, the emblem of the 33rd edition of the Olympic Games will be made of recycled champagne-colored steel to be produced by in three of metalwork giant ArcelorMittal's plants in France.The torch has also been designed to save materials, so that it can be reused around 10 times during the relays. Only 1,500 Olympic and 500 Paralympic torches will be entrusted to the 10,000 torchbearers who will relay the flame from Athens to Paris – ""six times less than usual, thus conserving resources,"" according to the organizing committee.Torchbearers – including comedian Jamel Debbouze, astronaut Thomas Pesquet and chef Thierry Marx – will receive ""a symbolic gift,"" while the limited edition torches will go ""to partners, Paris 24 sponsors, local authorities and stage towns,"" explained Lehanneur.Torches tend to burn well beyond the Olympics. In February 2023, the red and bronze flame from the 1968 Winter Games in Grenoble, Isère – those of Jean-Claude Killy's three gold medals – soared to €110,000, at an auction held by Millon of Lyon.The one designed by Philippe Starck for the Albertville Winter Olympics in 1992, known as La Corne because it was inspired by the little horns of the Tarentaise cows, has entered the collections of the Centre Pompidou in Paris. It is also regularly sold on the secondary art market, albeit a more modest price.",/en/lifestyle/
Luxury groups sniff out the high-end fragrance market,    Beauty brands are aiming to convert Chinese consumers by launching very expensive bottles of perfume ,"In Shenzhen, China, in a 4,500-square-meter store inaugurated on July 10, Galeries Lafayette has reserved 550 square meters for Edit Beauty, a space devoted exclusively to beauty product brands. So-called niche perfumes – meaning bottles costing over €200 – feature prominently. Earlier, in mid-June, La Samaritaine department store opened a ""Maison de Parfums"" in Paris. This section with its precious bottles is located in the basement, where 3,400 square meters have been dedicated to beauty products. Obviously, Sephora, another subsidiary of the LVMH group, will also devote a large part of its store on the Champs-Elysées, currently being renovated and scheduled to open at the end of 2023.Indeed, the entire industry now swears by its jus, eaux de parfum and extracts, with their very comfortable margins. According to the Financial Times, Kering paid €3.5 billion for Creed fragrances. The group, chaired by François-Henri Pinault, has refused to comment on the astronomical sum awarded to the BlackRock fund but has pointed out how profitable the brand is and how it presents strong potential. This acquisition illustrates the ambitions of the French group, which created a beauty division in early 2023 with Raffaella Cornaggia, a former Estée Lauder executive, in charge.At the end of 2022, the American company, the world's number two in cosmetics, acquired Tom Ford, a brand for which it has produced beauty products since 2006. The deal, which valued the American designer and former Gucci artistic director's brand at over $2.8 billion (€2.5 billion), has allowed Estée Lauder to integrate 100% of the sales of Tom Ford Beauty lines. In a press release, Fabrizio Freda, CEO of Estée Lauder Companies, said at the time that he wanted to achieve one billion dollars in sales with this brand known for its Orchid Noir, a fragrance in an ebony bottle.This follows a string of acquisitions. In 2015, Spain's Puig acquired L'Artisan Parfumeur and Penhaligon, two niche brands whose perfumes sell for €170 to €245. Five years later, L'Oréal, maker of Lancôme's La Vie Est Belle fragrances, acquired Clarins' fragrances, including Angel by Mugler. Some analysts believe that the acquisition of Aesop, completed in April, expresses the desire of the group headed by Nicolas Hieronimus to further develop its perfume sales.The Australian-born brand, valued at €2.3 billion, is recognized for its intensely scented skincare products. It will integrate its luxury division alongside Yves Saint Laurent, Lancôme and Giorgio Armani fragrances and cosmetics, whose sales grew by 23% in 2022 and 7.6% in the first half of 2023.",/en/lifestyle/
Paris by bike: 10 spots to cool off in the city,Selection,"Summer's here and temperatures are going up, meaning we're going to have to deal with heat waves. But you can follow the bike paths from the east to the west of Paris for a refreshing city journey.Tie up your bike on the rue Emile-Richard by the side of the entrance to the Montparnasse cemetery. Enter through the little porchway and close your eyes. It's like a heaven of peace and cyclists had cooled down on this June morning, which promised to be hot. With 1,200 trees over 19 hectares, the cemetery is one of the largest green spaces in the 14th arrondissement. Lime, Japanese pagoda, cedar, maple and ash trees act as natural air-conditioners. As such, it is listed as one of the capital's 1,200 ""urban cool islands,"" a space to find refuge during a heatwave.Of course, we had to brave the busy Place Denfert-Rochereau, full of cars and composed of a large intersection. Pedaling around the Lion de Belfort statue is still a major challenge. But once the feat is accomplished, after a few pedal strokes down Boulevard Arago, there's a cool haven for humans and animals alike. In front of the Observatoire de Paris, founded in 1667 – France's largest astronomy research center – the small adjoining garden feels like the countryside. It is home to around a hundred trees encompassing 15 different species, as well as flower beds and lawns. This diversity and the fact that it features various vegetation layers – herbs, shrubs and trees – give it rare environmental credentials among the 55 open parks and gardens in the 14th arrondissement. Currently closed for renovation, it will not be able to welcome overheated summer residents. But its reopening – eagerly awaited by the neighborhood – is scheduled for this autumn.As you tumble down the Rue de la Tombe-Issoire after exiting the Observatory, you'd think there was a fortress, a nest of spies or a military HQ awaiting. Faced with the barbed wire that encircles the Montsouris reservoir, you might even think that what lies within is some sort of treasure. The reservoir, formerly called ""Vanne,"" followed by ""Montrouge"" and now ""Montsouris"" was built in the 19th century by Eugène Belgrand, Baron Haussmann's engineer and the innovator of Paris' drinking water network. It remains one of the capital's five main drinking water storage reservoirs. Water is drawn from springs, wells and the surface waters of the Seine and Marne rivers, before being transported by aqueduct to seven treatment plants, which in 2019 produced around 500,000 cubic meters of water a day. It is projected that by the end of the century, the impact of climate change will lead to a reduction of 10% to 30% in river flow as well as a 10% decrease in groundwater recharge, upon which the Paris metropolitan area depends.",/en/lifestyle/
How Diet Prada thwarted Dolce & Gabbana's ambitions in China,"    Courts sometimes have to rule on creative disputes. In the case between luxury brand Dolce & Gabbana and Instagram account Diet Prada, the latter posted screenshots that landed the Italian company in hot water in China. ","The scale of the scandal was noteworthy. Some observers – most of whom have asked to remain anonymous – have compared it to the uproar caused by John Galliano's dismissal by Dior in 2011, after a video in which the designer was heard uttering anti-Semitic insults in a Paris bar circulated. In short, ""an incident that set the precedent"" of pitting two opposites against each other.On one side, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana. In 1985, the two designers combined their names to found a brand (which today exceeds €1 billion in annual sales) inspired by sexy, iconic Italian imagery: Sicilian widows, Venus-like beauties, tanned footballers and macho men with slicked-back hair. The other camp was American duo Tony Liu and Lindsey Schuyler. After meeting in a millinery shop in New York, these two fashion-loving friends launched the Instagram account Diet Prada in December 2014, which currently has 3.4 million followers.Tensions between the two parties ran so high that, in 2019, the designers summoned the bloggers (whose business was condemning plagiarism and cultural appropriation in the fashion industry) to appear in a Milan courtroom. Dolce & Gabbana's complaint for ""serious and repeated defamatory behavior"" ran to 47 pages and claimed over $665 million (nearly €591 million) in damages. The designers have only mentioned their adversaries once in the press, in 2021 in the Financial Times: ""[Are they] the Buddha? Jesus? No one has the right to judge another person without taking care of the consequences of what they are doing.""To understand this battle, let's go back to November 19, 2018. That day, Dolce & Gabbana published videos (#dgloveschina) as a teaser of sorts before their fashion show scheduled to take place in Shanghai two days later. The event, with 300 models and 1,500 guests, was intended to propel the Italian label into the lucrative Chinese market. As soon as they were published, however, the videos provoked outrage. They featured Chinese model Zuo Ye, seen cutting and eating pizza, spaghetti and cannoli with difficulty, using a pair of chopsticks. In the background, a lewd-sounding male voice-over can be heard saying: ""Is it too big for you?"".Online, users left a deluge of comments saying that the ads were crude, even racist. ""Dolce & Gabbana have built up a fantasy based on a cartoonish depiction of Italy as alluring, ironic and idealized, as if taken from a Bertolucci film,"" said semiotics specialist and consultant Luca Marchetti. ""But when we enter into intercultural dialogue, this same stereotypical approach becomes dangerous.""",/en/lifestyle/
Le Monde's selection of five refreshing water gardens,"    Le Monde takes you to superb green locations where water is omnipresent and skilfully staged, from Versailles – of course – to Annevoie in Belgium. ","From the murmuring cascatelle to the triumphant water games of the Sun King's estates, water can be found everywhere in historic gardens. It is staged in motionless mirrors of water reflecting the sky or gushing forth, bringing to life stone fountains and gilded water cascades. But it also flows from more discreet springs, winding through shady undergrowth, to the delight of walkers unafraid of getting lost.Versailles is the quintessential garden, designed by Louis XIV for his own glory and created by a brilliant gardener, André Le Nôtre (1613-1700). With his mastery of perspective and the art of gardening, Le Nôtre transformed a marshy area into the most beautiful garden of its time. Absent yet essential, water was diverted by hand or drawn from the Seine by a (deafening) machine in the neighboring city Marly and poured into gigantic reservoirs. The science of the best Italian fountain-makers was called upon to supply countless fountains, whose decorations were designed by the greatest artists of the time.From the Château's terrace, along the main axis of the gardens, you can admire the Parterre d'Eau, the Latone fountain, the Apollo's chariot pool (currently being restored) and the Grand Canal (with its lovely walk all around). To the south, opposite the Orangerie, but separate from the Château, the Suisses lake, open to visitors, runs alongside the King's kitchen garden, with its imposing royal gate. To the north, the Dragon and Neptune pools regularly come alive with spectacular water effects, as do the groves of the Colonnade, Encelade, Salle de Bal and Bains d'Apollon, during Grandes Eaux Musicales and Jardins Musicaux events (admission fee charged). And let's not forget the Trianon Water Cascade, whose marble and gold have recently been restored and reconnected with water.The Château de Courances in the department of Essonne, south of Paris, built in the 18th century, underwent major remodeling in the last quarter of the 19th century, including the addition of an exterior staircase inspired by the one at Fontainebleau. The design of some parts of the park is Renaissance, thus predating Le Nôtre's creations at Vaux-le-Vicomte, Chantilly or Versailles. The main water feature, the Miroir, which covers an area of one hectare, dates from the 18th century, the Bassins de la Baigneuse and Du Fer à Cheval from the early 20th century, during work carried out by an ancestor of the current owners. The pool in the elegant Japanese garden, on the other hand, is more recent.",/en/lifestyle/
Cycling through the UK: Five rides from the beautiful gardens of Kent to the dazzling Gower Peninsula,Selection,"Ride down the Beatles' Penny Lane, cross the width of Devon from coast to coast and discover Kent's wonderful gardens at your leisure: The UK has plenty to offer for cyclists. City-loving biking enthusiasts and off-road adventurers alike can rely on excellent signage for navigation, as well as invaluable information on the Sustrans and GPS routes websites.You don't have to choose between nature and culture in Liverpool. Culturally, the home of the Beatles embraces the spirit of the 60s, with an electric bike tour dedicated to the legendary band. The 25-kilometer ride takes you down Penny Lane, then past Strawberry Field's red gate – the former Salvation Army orphanage now open to the public – and John Lennon's birthplace in the village of Woolton. Nicknamed ""Mendips,"" it was purchased by Yoko Ono in 2002, who then donated it to the National Trust, the British heritage preservation organization. In terms of nature, the Liverpool Loop Line is ideal for families: it's a 17-kilometer greenway along the old railway line in northeast Liverpool. It's worth noting that you no longer need to look for city bikes any more; they were replaced by the Voi app's ""Explorer 2"" electric bikes at the end of 2022.The small port city of Swansea, Wales, is proud to be a ""cycle-friendly city"" where you can travel by bike in complete safety. From the historic center to the tip of Mumbles, the Victorian seaside resort that closes off the bay, a cycle path follows the old tramway line along the seafront. Ideal for families, this 10-kilometer ride leads to the spectacular ruins of Oystermouth Castle and to beaches such as Bracelet Bay and its pretty lighthouse. You can also explore the Gower Peninsula to the west. Gower was the first place in the UK to be designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, back in 1956. Easily accessible by bike, Rhossili Bay's long stretch of golden sand is perfect for surfing, playing in the sand or watching the sunset.Picture a perfectly vertical line between the small seaside town of Ilfracombe on Devon's north coast, and the city of Plymouth on its southern coast. This is the English section of EuroVelo 1, a route that runs from Norway to Portugal. The French section is known as the Vélodyssée. Here, it's the National Cycle Route 27, which runs along former railroad lines. It initially follows Woolacombe beach, then wends its way through the countryside. From tunnels to viaducts, you'll reach the granite landscapes and forests of Dartmoor National Park, before returning to the city and Plymouth Bay. For those in search of an athletic challenge, try cycling the 150 kilometers from one coast of Devon to the other in a single stretch, and then compare your time with other Route 27 cyclists.",/en/lifestyle/
A gentle retreat in Corsica,Feature,"Immediately after Bastia, on the road to Cap Corse, the steep slopes of the island come closer, covered in dense vegetation. The mainland seems far away. The narrow road meanders gently along the Mediterranean before turning towards the mountains and the hamlet of Pozzo, in Brando.A bell tower comes into view amidst the pine and cypress trees. Keep your eyes peeled for the ""cappuccini"" sign (Capuchin monks lived here) to enter the building, which backs onto the church. The Pozzo convent, built in the 15th century, is an unusual place. Immediately, your eye is drawn to the mesmerizing view, with the swimming pool and the island of Elba in the distance.Apart from the magical location, this is primarily a family home that has borne witness to Corsica's history, and history in general. Once a novitiate, where young men prepared for religious life, the place was profoundly impacted by the French Revolution and acquired in 1796 by an ancestor of Emmanuelle Picon (Mattei, on her mother's side), the current owner, who now welcomes guests.""The convent has been in the family for seven generations. As a child, I used to come here every summer,"" she said, having changed her life almost 10 years ago, after a career in Paris working in public relations and marketing. The house's survival was at stake: To maintain it and pass it on to future generations, it needed to be looked after daily.Here, it's as if you've been invited over to the home of friends who have given over the space to soak up time. In the former monks' refectory, with its red terracotta floor, a majestic depiction of the Last Supper fits perfectly with the contours of the vaulted walls. Elsewhere, a crucified Christ and a Virgin visited by an angel decorate a room with their subtle presence. We're in Corsica, and Napoleon I makes appearances here and there, sculpted on a sideboard and painted on the back of pretty ceramic plates.There are also various books that you can imagine were accumulated over the course of vacations: Henri Troyat, Françoise Sagan and Hervé Bazin were all read before a dip in the pool, or taken to the beach via the mule track down to Erbalunga marina. ""A house like this requires delicate handling. I've tried to transform it as little as possible while respecting the spirit of the place,"" said Picon.You don't stay at the convent as if you were in a hotel, but as a guest sharing your meals with the other residents. The ever-changing menus also tell the story of Ile de Beauté, the ""Beautiful Island"" as it is known in French: Comforting bastelle (turnovers with chard and brocciu), Bastia-style anchovies, smoked coppa ham, milk-fed veal, strong-flavored ewe's milk cheeses, exceptional lemon curd (made in the convent itself), Corsican honey and exquisite canistrelli cookies – all of which are washed down with a Ribella beer or a local Patrimonio wine. This Corsican PDO produces silky reds from the niellucio grape.",/en/lifestyle/
"Culture, fashion, gastronomy: Le Monde's top end-of-summer picks",Selection,"The end of summer means it's time to distract yourself from the shorter days with a dazzling new creative season in France. Overcome the back-to-the-office blues with metallic make-up, opulent tote bags and exquisite menswear. Delight your palate at a legendary French chef's first Paris restaurant. Prolong the summer sunshine with elegant Sicilian wines and vibrant olive oils. Immerse yourself in exciting new French cinema and Nicolas de Staël's brilliant landscapes. And dance like nobody's watching to the latest girl rappers.Marin Karmitz, born in 1938, is not only one of the most important figures in the world of European cinema, through the company MK2, he is also a major collector of contemporary art and his role in the careers of artists such as Christian Boltanski is undeniable. The Corps à Corps exhibition, which opens at Centre Pompidou on September 6, is a dialogue between two photographic collections, Marin Karmitz's and the Paris museum's own. In all, 500 works by 120 historic and contemporary photographers will be on display. It's up to the visitor to weave links between creations, between movements and between the personal vision of one man, and the more scientific but equally emotional vision of a museum. C. Gh.Nicolas de Staël's mission in painting was to ""return man to himself,"" as summed up by his faithful friend, the poet René Char. Paris's Museum of Modern Art unveils the infinite richness of the work of the Russian exile, a legend on the post-war Parisian scene, through a vast retrospective of some 200 paintings, drawings, prints and notebooks. From Paris to Antibes, it retraces in all its intensity his 15-year trajectory, shattered by his suicide at the age of 41 in 1955. ""Life is so sad without paintings that I go for it as long as I can,"" wrote the artist who defied categorization, who refused to enter the debates between abstraction and figuration that divided the art world of the time.Returning to his first figurative steps, then to the floating forms of his canvases from the war years, the exhibition reveals his ""inevitable need to break everything when the machine seems to be running too smoothly."" Established as the central figure of the Second Paris School, de Staël nevertheless refused to belong to any movement, exploring techniques and formats, tirelessly changing tools and subjects, from soccer to still life. Less well known, he was also a virtuoso draughtsman, as revealed by a rich selection of works on paper. The highlight of the exhibition is his uncluttered landscapes of the 1950s, evoked through a number of canvases never before shown in a French museum.",/en/lifestyle/
"Marc Bohan, former creative director of Dior, has died","    For over 25 years, he reigned over the renowned French fashion house. A discreet friend to the stars, he established the brand in the perfume market. He died on September 6, 2023, at the age of 97. ","Designing clothes that are sophisticated yet simple, without forgetting to add a touch of cheekiness: This was Marc Bohan's guiding principle throughout his career as a couturier at Christian Dior. He died on Wednesday, September 6, at his home in Burgundy, France, at the age of 97. Although he had developed an interest in textiles as a child, his family tried to dissuade him from taking up couture. Born in Paris on August 22, 1926, he began studying finance after passing his final school exams at Lycée Lakanal. But the young man was determined to follow his own instincts and aspirations.He soon abandoned his ""boring and tedious"" studies and was hired as a workshop apprentice by Jean Patou, before becoming assistant designer to couturier Robert Piguet in 1946. He left to do his military service in 1948, and from the moment he returned to France, he worked with the leading designers of the day, first at the Paris atelier of British designer Edward Molyneux, then at Madeleine de Rauch's popular studio, a stone's throw from the Champs-Elysées.In 1953, he opened his own couture house on the prestigious Avenue George-V, then the epicenter of Parisian chic. A year later, however, his financial mismanagement forced him to close the company. While he returned to Patou for a time, the adventure of a lifetime awaited him. He was called in by the Boussac family, then owners of Christian Dior, to replace at a moment's notice the young creative director, Yves Saint-Laurent, who had been called up for military service in 1957. Saint-Laurent had been appointed to the post a few months earlier, following the sudden death of Christian Dior.When Saint-Laurent returned, his place was taken: The Boussacs had found their star couturier. He was officially creative director of Christian Dior from 1961 to 1989. Under his impetus, the Dior silhouette, made famous by the ""New Look"" line in 1947, became restrained and deceptively sensible. Dresses and suits were elegant and popular with the Tout-Paris (the stylish and affluent elite of Paris), with femininity nestling in the detail of a bow or a hemline and embroidery illuminating jackets and evening gowns. He traversed the eras and knew perfectly how to transpose their essence into his creations. From the liberation of the body in the 1960s with flowing little dresses, to the introduction of cotton T-shirts worn with baggy pants in the '70s, to the grandiloquent sheath dresses of the following decade, the Dior aesthetic asserted itself with panache.An innovator, he was the first couturier to offer a line for young children in 1967, called ""Baby Dior,"" followed by a range of menswear called ""Christian Dior Monsieur"" in 1970. A lover of fragrances, he also brought the house into this promising market. Eau Sauvage, the house's first scent for men, was a success when launched in 1966. To rejuvenate the brand's image, he also created a line for young women in 1967, simply called ""Miss Dior."" A major friend to the stars, he dressed Elizabeth Taylor, Grace Kelly, Sylvie Vartan and Maria Callas. In 1967, he designed Farah Diba's sumptuous outfit for the coronation of her husband, the shah of Iran.""My friends sometimes wonder at my withdrawal behind the Christian Dior name. My sole ambition has always been to justify the trust placed in me, from Marcel Boussac, to all those whose talent I knew needed the House of Dior to continue,"" he wrote in the preface to the catalog of a 2009 exhibition devoted to his work at the Musée Dior in Granville (northwestern France). In 1984, Bernard Arnault bought Christian Dior Couture from the Boussac group, keeping Bohan at the helm of design. In 1983 and 1988, he received two Dés d'or awards, the ultimate accolade for a haute couture designer. He retired from the job in 1989, to make way for Gianfranco Ferré. Bohan's work and world are highlighted in the 2018 book Dior By Marc Bohan, by fashion journalist Jérôme Hanover.August 22, 1926 Born in Paris1961-1989 Creative director for the House of Dior1966 Created Eau Sauvage fragrance1983 Wins his first Dé d'orSeptember 6, 2023 Died in Châtillon-sur-Seine, in northeastern France",/en/lifestyle/
Five little-known treasures for the whole family to discover at Paris's Jardin des Plantes,"    Four centuries old, the botanical garden, home to the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle and the Grande Galerie de l'Évolution, is a must-see for children, with its own mysteries and secret corners. ","Schoolchildren in the Paris region picnic here at least once, after saluting the Durfort mammoth in the paleontology gallery, a quick sweat in the tropical greenhouse and a visit to the menagerie. But the Jardin des Plantes, which has been open to the public since 1640, has many other nuggets to discover alongside these, which you can explore with the whole family.What a strange little green hill! There's nothing natural about the hillock overlooking the Jardin des Plantes. It was artificially formed by the accumulation of garbage and rubble before being covered with vines. Walkers can venture between the well-trimmed hedges of the winding path, also known as the labyrinth, in which it's impossible to get lost. The path inevitably leads to the summit and Buffon's gazebo. This small iron structure – the oldest metal monument in Paris – has watched over the garden since 1787. It was built at the request of Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, the famous 18th-century naturalist and encyclopedist, steward of the King's Garden.This viewpoint will give your souvenir photos an undeniably bucolic feel. Once you've descended from the labyrinth, you can enjoy a little treasure hunt, trying to find the tomb of naturalist Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton, first director of the Muséum d’histoire naturelle, and three large bronze sculptures engraved with the verses of Saint-John Perse's Nocturne. The 1973 poem begins: ""Here they are ripe, these fruits of a shady destiny...""If your children are fascinated by the secret life of trees, they won't be disappointed as they stroll through the paths. Just below the labyrinth stands the majestic Jussieu cedar from Lebanon. Surrounded by a stone bench where you can rest in its pleasant shade, this tree was the first of its kind to be imported into France, in 1734. This cedar, with its flattened crown and spreading branches – known as a tabular habit – is one of the oldest in the garden.Another tree not to be missed is Buffon's plane tree, planted in 1785. It stands 27 meters tall and has never been pruned. It can be picked out by its beautiful marbled bark and pale green-grey foliage. Finally, in front of the Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy Gallery, the Stegosaurus statue will catch the eye of younger visitors. Surrounding it is an evocation of the vegetation of the dinosaur era. Among the trees is the Wollemi pine. This long-ignored conifer was only discovered in Australia in 1994. It was planted in France 12 years later.",/en/lifestyle/
Le Monde's selection of five Parisian restaurants with great terraces,Selection,"There are plenty of good places to eat under the open sky in Paris' suburbs. From Youpi au Théâtre, the marvelous cafeteria installed in the summer under the canopy of the Théâtre de Gennevilliers, to Villa9Trois and its charming tables in Montreuil. In Paris, the streets have become permanently adorned with summer terraces that can bloom on the asphalt from April 1 to October 31 in the wake of Covid. But finding the right combination of a terrace, a quiet street and good food is not always easy.Here's a selection of highly recommended tables where you can enjoy the sun's embrace while being able to hear what the person sitting next to you is saying.L'Entrepôt is like a Swiss Army knife. This former printing shop now houses a gallery, a concert hall, an art house cinema and a large restaurant (130 covers) sheltered by an oversized glass roof. In the summer, a terrace protected by plane trees and a partition dotted with emerald-green ceramics is an invitation to indulge in good food and sunbathing. For the past three years, the cheerful team from Fulgurances (three establishments in Paris and one in New York) has taken over the restaurant, and their plates always return to the kitchen empty. At lunchtime, William Cottier creates small miracles (menus start from €21) by focusing on seasonal produce.The 36-year-old chef has a preference for low-fat fried dishes, homemade oils and vinegars. We also fell under the spell of his grease-free tempura-cooked spring onions, followed by a mayonnaise flavored with hay-smoked oil, and oysters with shiso vinegar (the leaf of which is widely used in Japanese cuisine). In the evenings, Cottier and his brigade assist resident chefs: Fulgurances' philosophy is to showcase young and already well-honed talent. The most recent of these is Australian-born chef Reece Moore, who prepared a summer menu that's all about texture at a fair price (€42). We were able to sample a mustardy veal tartare, pigeon with tarragon mayonnaise, sorrel sorbet and raspberry coulis, with strong but controlled tastes. And we also left our plates carefully cleaned.If you like local produce, no-nonsense cooking and dishes that take several days to prepare (yes, really), you just found your new HQ. The Italian establishment Aglio e Olio and the neighboring French restaurant Massale were both created by the smiling Thomas Chapelle, who offers his expert advice as he goes from table to table. Aglio e Olio is his newest creation: affordable (lunch menus start from €18; dinner menu from €45) while respecting produce and tradition. In the summer, the restaurant, located on a quiet street, can accommodate up to 30 diners.",/en/lifestyle/
Fashion film: Welcome to Gordon von Steiner's dreamy country party,Feature,"At the beginning of July, in a château and manor house on the outskirts of Paris, director and photographer Gordon von Steiner and designer Imruh Asha, creator of the explosively colorful fashion series imbued with a real joie de vivre, invited some fifteen models, including star models Adut Akech, Mona Tougaard and Loli Bahia, to a friendly country party.For two days, they let these young people ""have their fun,"" capturing scenes that were as natural as possible: running through the meadows and corridors of the old mansion, drinking cognac from the bottle, fooling around and bickering, getting ready for a party, and all for hours.The result is a film inspired, according to its creator, by the American and French cinema of the 1960s. Indeed, while the setting of a castle in the middle of fields may recall that of Alain Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad (1961), it is the image of a relaxed, joyful, almost Californian youth that appears on the screen. The images below are taken from the film. As von Steiner puts it, ""It's up to the viewer to decide what's real and what's fictional.""",/en/lifestyle/

Svenskt Tenn presents another vision of Swedish design,Long Read,"Swedish designer Estrid Ericson is said to have loved entertaining in her apartment in a classic building on Strandvägen Street, just above her boutique facing Stockholm harbor. Those who frequented her home confirmed that she was a mediocre cook. But it didn't matter. Guests didn't come to fill their bellies but to feast their eyes. Born in 1894, Ericson had turned the art of dining into an art in itself. ""Food was matched to the tableware, but something had to stand out and arouse astonishment,"" said decorator Karin Södergren, who is responsible for the store's layout.Almost a century later, the Strandvägen boutique remains the only physical address for the Svenskt Tenn brand, which generates a very large proportion of its sales on its website. Now a tourist attraction in Stockholm, it is also a must for design aficionados. Dressed all in black, its employees continue to apply its founder's principles.Throughout the store, vases of freshly cut flowers adorn the furniture. Every Monday morning, Ericson brought back armfuls of them from her country home in southern Stockholm. Svenskt Tenn was much more than a decorative boutique: ""Estrid wanted to create a magical world,"" said Per Ahldén, the collections and archives manager, wearing tortoiseshell glasses and a bow tie.At the entrance, two earthenware dogs welcome visitors. Some come to shop. Others come to stroll or seek inspiration. There are those who grew up with the brand; those who accidentally discovered that they unknowingly owned Svenskt Tenn objects, usually inherited; and others, often younger, who discovered it in magazines or on decoration websites.On Strandvägen Street, the store layout changes with the seasons. Like a museum, the 1,700-square-meter space features all the brand's most emblematic creations: the pewter lion by sculptor Anna Petrus; the enormous Liljevalchs sofa designed by Austrian architect Josef Frank in 1934 for Ericson's apartment, with its tapestries and floral fabrics; and the Knot of Friendship candle holder that Frank designed on the eve of the Second World War, which has since become a bestseller.A showcase and flagship, the boutique opened its doors in 1927, three years after the birth of the Svenskt Tenn brand. The store has been expanded several times since. The decoration has been tirelessly redone. And yet, Ericson, who died in 1981, seems never to have left the premises. Large black-and-white portraits hang on the wall, displaying her mischievous gaze, while upstairs, behind a glass wall, you can admire her studio, where a long wooden table stands opposite a wall of shelves, filled with shells, knick-knacks brought back from her travels and personal creations.",/en/lifestyle/
Azzedine Alaïa at the Palais Galliera: The eclectic treasures of a clothing collector,Long Read,"You've got to really love fashion to spend almost 50 years scouring auctions and protecting textile treasures made or worn by others from being destroyed or dispersed. Azzedine Alaïa never made much of his passion. He spoke very little about it, went to the auction rooms alone or with a different person each time and never flaunted his discoveries. The collection – and above all its magnitude – was not discovered until his death in 2017. It was his secret garden, the mission he had set himself.With the same rigor and uncompromising attitude he applied to his work as a couturier, he ultimately assembled what appears to be the world's largest personal collection of clothing, comprising 20,000 pieces. Of these, 140 are on display for the first time at the Palais Galliera, the Musée de la Mode (Paris Fashion Museum), until January 21. This is 10 years after the institution dedicated a retrospective to him for the reopening of its renovated galleries in 2013. The other 19,860 items remain out of sight, in a warehouse on the outskirts of Paris and on the secure floors of 18 Rue de la Verrerie, in the Marais.This historic address, acquired by the couturier in 1987, now houses the headquarters of the Fondation Azzedine Alaïa, which was recognized as an ""Établissement d'Utilité Publique"" (an organization governed by private law whose creation has been formalized by decree) in 2020. There is also a showroom, some storerooms, a restaurant and a bookstore, as well as the workshops and studio of the Alaïa brand (owned by the Richemont group), where Pieter Mulier currently serves as artistic director. Only Alaïa's death, on November 18, 2017, at the age of 82, brought an end to his buying frenzy and to his ambition to create a unique fashion heritage for France.He was bitten by the bug in May 1968. Cristóbal Balenciaga decided to close his couture house. Mademoiselle Renée, director of the label and a close collaborator of the Spanish master, called Alaïa to come and pick up anything he deemed useful for his work. ""Alaïa was a young designer aged 33 at the time, but his talent and technical mastery were already recognized,"" said Miren Arzalluz, director of the Palais Galliera and curator, along with Olivier Saillard, of the exhibition opening on September 27. Initially thinking of reusing the fabric from the dresses, he brought back everything he could. However, Balenciaga's clothes, their cuts, the sophistication of their structure and the complexity behind the apparent simplicity all impressed Alaïa, who refused to cut them up.",/en/lifestyle/
I'll be staying at Le Corbusier or Gaetano Pesce's place: Five architect-designed houses for rent,Selection,"We're already dreaming of our next vacation, so here are five places to stay that have been designed by icons of the architectural world. Whether a lesser-known modernist gem, a surprising cabin among the olive trees or a minimalist room in the vineyards, they are all unique experiences.Le Corbusier didn't just design Marseille's Cité Radieuse, Firminy is also worth a visit. In fact, it was in this town in the Loire department, not far from Saint-Etienne, that he built his largest architectural complex in Europe.Located in the Firminy-Vert neighborhood, it includes the Maison de la Culture, a stadium, Saint-Pierre church (completed in 2006), a swimming pool and a housing unit – the fifth to be built in the world. This one embodies a novel spatial arrangement combining the advantages of collective and individual housing. As advocated by the architect, each space is tailored to the needs of modernity, with no frills and furniture reduced to its functional role. Designed to provide maximum natural light, this 130-meter concrete ""living machine"" stands on stilts and faces west and east, with bay windows that offer sweeping views of the surrounding countryside, gradually encroached upon by urbanization.You can discover this unique place by visiting a show apartment, providing a taste of the France of the ""Trente Glorieuses"" (""Thirty Glorious Years,"" 1945-1975), as well as by staying in the duplex at the top of the unit, which is available for rental and can accommodate up to six guests. Formed by merging two apartments, the 125-square-meter dwelling is no longer fitted out with the original furniture designed by Pierre Guariche, apart from the serving hatch. With simple decor in colors reminiscent of those used by the architect, the walk-through apartment features a living room opening onto two terraces, providing a panoramic view of the Le Corbusier site.When it comes to the Memphis group, we have obviously heard of Ettore Sottsass, an icon of Italian design. Unfortunately, the names of his contemporaries are less well-known. Among them is Italian architect and designer Matteo Thun. He designed the Pergola Residence, an apartment hotel in Lagundo, in Italy's Alto Adige region.Nestled among vineyards and apple orchards, the building is clad in rubble stone, as if to evoke the terraced walls of the vineyards, and wood, which is abundant in the hotel's 14 suites. They are all south-facing, with large terraces offering panoramic views of the Adige Valley and surrounding mountains. The minimalist setting also features an elegant pergola, beneath which guests are invited to walk barefoot.",/en/lifestyle/
Milan Fashion Week was a parade of quiet luxury,"    During this year's shows in Lombardy, designers embraced more simple designs while emphasizing the quality of their craftsmanship. ","Could it be a deep-seated trend? In the spring of 2023, the ""discreet luxury"" movement made its appearance following Gwyneth Paltrow's trial for a skiing accident. The actress made her mark by wearing timelessly chic outfits to court every day, devoid of any ostentatious signs of wealth, but all from luxury labels. After several seasons marked by the predominance of logos, exaggerated volumes, and a sexy but trashy aesthetic that has been brought back from the 2000s, quiet luxury, in its original version, seems to be carving a serious place for itself on the catwalks of Milan Fashion Week, held from September 19 to 25.Fendi still played a little with its ""F"" logo, which remains present on the bags, but the overall tone is sober. Designer Kim Jones was inspired by the timeless beauty of Rome, in particular the Colosseum, daily inspiration along the route of his office commute. For the show, there was no amphitheater in sight, but there were monumental white statues of Fendi bags in front of which posed graceful women dressed for every occasion. Some wore a simple monochrome turtleneck knit dress (that subtly uncovered one shoulder), while others played with color like aniseed-toned pinstripe pants under an ochre trench coat and vermilion gloves.Eveningwear took the form of a long, sky-blue dress, like a satin sheet layed nonchalantly over the body. The audience, made up of an array of 50-something stars (Kate Moss, Demi Moore, Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell...), embodied the ideal customers for this tasteful wardrobe, whose straight lines and precision are sometimes a little cold.For its part, Max Mara offered a sunnier version of quiet luxury, inspired by a theme that is anything but lavish: the daily life of the British Women's Land Army, the 80,000 rural and urban women who, during the Second World War, took on farm work to feed the nation while the men were off fighting.To give character to his workwear pieces, designer Ian Griffiths cut them from thick white cotton canvas, dyed them separately, then machine-dyed them to shade their color and ""give each piece a unique character."" The result was very convincing, from the big, collarless, indigo, trench coats, to the royal blue apron dresses, to the magenta playsuit, to the buttercup yellow shirts, to the pants with emerald patch pockets, to the ochre jackets.At Ferragamo, too, the source of inspiration was far from opulence: Maximilian Davis took an interest in arte povera – the avant-garde art movement that emerged in Italy in the 1960s – which favors the use of natural or reclaimed materials. The designer transposed the idea of elevating elemental materials through creation, by working with simple cotton and linen canvases that he embroidered onto satin capes or treated to blend with leather. ""I wanted things to be light, both in terms of fabric and construction, but also in terms of the lines. I wanted this collection to be pure and honest, yet interesting to the touch,"" explained the designer. In any case, the collection is bursting with ideas, from body-wrapping togas with abstract patterns to suits with sleeves slit to the shoulders, to form-fitting dresses in stiff leather, illuminated by large, jewel-like silver clasps.While they're not highlighting their logos, discreet luxury brands do tend to promote the quality of their craftsmanship. And it is exactly what Tod's is doing: celebrating ""made in Italy."" The company invited its guests into the workshops where the sets for Milan's La Scala are made: models make their way between the columns and plaster sculptures that will be used for the next production of Verdi's Don Carlos opera, which is premiering in December.For his latest collection at Tod's, designer Walter Chiapponi drew inspiration from the 1990s –the decade dominated by the minimalism of Prada and Helmut Lang – to design a tastefully perfect wardrobe in which women look comfortable. Suits are formal yet supple (because they have no lining), pleated skirts are worn with skin-tight jackets and a sienna shirt-dress is enough to make a statement. Deceptively simple and skillfully cut, this collection also has the merit of not projecting a vision of an imaginary woman.This is also the strength of Jil Sander, who is capable of creating a collection that looks good without seeming to think about it. Designers Luke and Lucie Meier didn't bother with concepts; They played on contrasts, between feminine and masculine, the every day and the glamorous, all supported by highly advanced technical research and exquisite materials. The show opened with an almond-green dress, whose fine-knit top contrasted with the opulence of the gathered, thick-wool skirt; the model was also wearing a light cap and a necklace of large, sparkling stones. From a pale pink coat that was a little too wide, to a large black trench coat, to a white poplin dress embroidered with openwork, to an XXL shirt that hid the wearer's hands, to a long ivory dress simply decorated with two metallic circles at the shirt collar, sometimes it doesn't take much to look elegant.",/en/lifestyle/
Paris Fashion Week: A sense of celebration,"    Roses by the thousands at Balmain, silver harem pants at Rabanne, sequined denim with a disco touch at Acne Studios – all showcasing designers embracing vibrant and whimsical fashion. ","Could it be a desire to preserve fashion as a separate bubble, far from distressing reality? Joie de vivre and a festive spirit were the order of the day on the catwalks of Paris Fashion Week, which runs until October 3.""I'm a maximalist designer, I love colors and prints, I want to make people happy. We all need it, I think,"" explained Olivier Rousteing at Balmain, still smiling despite his recent setback – the brand had a truck carrying some of the collection's pieces held up on September 16. The show must go on, with an ode to roses, a print found in the archives and reinterpreted in a thousand ways – bouquets emerging from bags, applied to short, draped dresses, on a spectacular coat or on the hips of slips. What didn't we see in this collection, because of the robbery? ""Tuxedos, denim and jersey pieces,"" which ultimately did nothing to detract from this festive evening wardrobe.It's a different kind of party that Acne Studios is celebrating, 2000s rave-style, with a giant, broken disco ball at the end of the catwalk. ""This season's industrial vibe comes mainly from my passion for denim and the many ways we can manipulate this extraordinary fabric,"" commented creative director Jonny Johansson. Here, it's effectively covered in white clay-like paint, worn as hip-low pants or a ripped miniskirt. Long dresses in blue, red or green are draped and floaty, or embroidered with sequins. Bras were hastily slipped over cropped tank tops as if the night had been too short, but joyful.Julien Dossena's Rabanne collection is richly adorned in silver and gold. The secret weapon of the designer, helming his twentieth fashion show for the house, lies in the metallic mesh dear to the founder. ""It's like finding an old friend and having fun with them – the possibilities are endless. For some, it evokes a medieval dimension. For others, it's made for parties. In any case, it's a fascinating material to work with.""Here, inspiration leans towards a desert community, with harem pants that offer great freedom, short or draped dresses, pants covered with sequins or in an ultra-light wool and silk blend. The ensemble works, as it makes you want to join this community for a summer.",/en/lifestyle/
"Nîmes, a welcome gastronomic surprise",Feature,"It's 11 pm, and the temperature in Nîmes' city center, scorched by the heatwave, is only just starting to become bearable. Behind the Carré d'Art, the city's contemporary art museum, François-Xavier Durieu is getting ready to close up shop. Two years ago, he and his wife Emmanuelle created Textures, an odd establishment halfway between a second-hand shop, delicatessen and fine dining restaurant where customers can pick up loose tea, ceramics, cookery books and unusual dishes combining many different influences. The owner improvises mosaic plates where cuttlefish mingle with roasted eggplants, watermelons are shaken with a little balsamic vinegar and fig-flavored brandades. The plate combines organic vegetables and local fish for less than €20.Textures' unique formula and family atmosphere have attracted a host of customers who have become friends. That evening, Durieu didn't close the door of his restaurant at 11 pm as planned. ""Good evening, guys. Not too hot?"" he asked a couple of regulars who dropped by to say hello. The owner spontaneously pulled out a bench and a bistro table on the sidewalk and paid for a round of natural wine while the discussion turned to Nîmes' booming culinary scene.""I grew up here, but I hesitated to come back,"" said the chef. ""After working in London and then Lyon, I was afraid I'd get bored. The way I remember it, the restaurant scene remained stuck on fairly classic offers. I had it all wrong. We're going through a shift: The people of Nîmes and its new residents – many Parisians who came after the lockdown – want to try something new.""The Gard prefecture (the French department in which Nîmes is located) has been receiving praise from all over the world. In January, the New York Times, enticed by its gourmet addresses, made it the only ""must-visit"" French city – out of 52 destinations. In March, the Michelin Guide awarded a star to Rouge, a gourmet restaurant run by Benin-born chef Georgiana Viou, bringing to five the number of Michelin-starred establishments in and around the town. A fine score for a city of 150,000 too often boiled down to its Roman-era stones and ferias.""There's a momentum,"" confirmed Viou. ""Nîmes is opening up to the world, and I'm proof of it. I was quickly accepted, and people were even insisting that I move from Marseille. And now I have!"" In its two years, Rouge's beautiful tree-lined inner courtyard has lost none of its magic, and the chef's mixed dishes – combining the cuisine from her native Benin and the Mediterranean – have become even more refined.",/en/lifestyle/
French chefs grapple with growing number of  intolerances: 'You have to be willing to offer a different cuisine',"    More and more restaurant-goers are mentioning their special dietary requirements, forcing cooks to modify some of their dishes and find delightful culinary solutions. ","This summer, the Burgundian restaurant Le Charlemagne warned on its website: ""We no longer accept vegetarians, pescatarians [people who eat fish but not meat] and celiacs [people who are gluten intolerant]."" Laurent Peugeot, owner of this Michelin-starred restaurant set in the heart of the vineyards near Beaune is fed up with these restrictions. ""Fifteen years ago, people with a gluten allergy would come with a doctor's note, and we were careful because the slightest slip-up in the kitchen could be fatal,"" he said. ""We didn't play around with flouring molds for pie shells because that could send customers to the hospital. Today, when we offer a small gougère (a baked choux pastry) with sesame and epoisses (a type of cheese from Burgundy), people who are supposedly gluten intolerant tell us that it looks good and that they can eat it! Many people who are 'allergic' simply don't like certain ingredients. This discredits the real sufferers, and makes our job a hell of a lot harder.""The notice posted on the website was of little use as ""intolerant"" customers kept coming to Le Charlemagne. The restaurant removed it. ""Today, we're trying to educate people,"" said the chef. ""We have to make people understand that when we work on a unique menu, we use top-of-the-range products, such as two-month aged beef and pigeon raised 3 kilometers away, which are difficult to replace.""A distinction is made between those who are allergic (with immediate symptoms, leading to an immune response that can affect the skin, digestive system or respiratory tract and be life-threatening) and those who are intolerant (with delayed symptoms generally boiling down to intestinal disturbances). A study carried out by the National Agency for Food Safety between 2014 and 2015 on 2,288 adults and 2,084 young people (up to the age of 17) indicates that 3.9% of adults and 4.2% of young people believe they suffer from a food intolerance or allergy. These data are uncertain, as many real or supposed sufferers don't get diagnosed. One thing is certain: Restaurateurs are seeing an increasing number of customers claiming to be intolerant. Most of them (including Laurent Peugeot) estimate that one table in 10 is affected.""The number of customers with specific diets depends mainly on where we work,"" said Mory Sacko. The already tall chef (over 2 meters) looks outsized in his MoSuke restaurant, which is as small and delicate as a piece of origami and located near the Montparnasse tower in Paris. Having worked at the Royal Monceau, the Shangri-La and the Mandarin Oriental before exploding in the media on Top Chef, Sacko has observed that the international clientele of luxury hotels are more likely to try something different on the menu. ""At MoSuke, I have at least one customer talking to me about allergies every day,"" he said. ""But American customers are 10 times more difficult than French customers!""",/en/lifestyle/
The luxury sector is also impacted by the economic slowdown,"    With a 9% decline in third-quarter sales, Kering is struggling to maintain its performance, while Hermès handbags continue to set new records. ","Danger isn't yet at the door. But the poor economic climate of the third quarter of 2023 is also affecting the luxury goods sector. Sales figures published by the major French groups have revealed a slowdown in the growth of sales of bags, suits and perfumes for some, and a much more severe fall for others.Clearly, the spectacular rebound seen in 2022 is ancient history. The Bain & Company consultancy and the Italian Altagamma Foundation have already issued a warning: ""After the 2022 record, the global luxury market is expected to record growth of 5% to 12% in 2023,"" estimated their sector study, published in June. LVMH confirmed a ""return to normal"" on October 10.This luxury group, which acts as a barometer for the luxury industry, published sales of €19.96 billion, achieved in three months this summer. This is 9% more than in the third quarter of 2022, at constant exchange rates. But this growth is lower than the +17 % recorded in the first half of 2023. In this group founded by Bernard Arnault, sales of leather goods and fashion brands are no exception to the phenomenon: they came out 9% higher in the third quarter, after rising 20% in the first half of the year.The landing for its French rival Kering is much more complicated. The group chaired by François-Henri Pinault saw its sales fall by 9% in the third quarter of 2023, at constant exchange rates, to €4.46 billion. ""Over and above the difficult macroeconomic context and the slowdown in demand in the luxury sector,"" the French group's underperformance is reportedly linked to ""the impact of decisions aimed at reinforcing the exclusivity"" of the Kering group's brands, explained CEO François-Henri Pinault, in a press release on Tuesday, October 24.Kering has been particularly penalized by Gucci's bad patch since 2020: the ""new chapter"" it has been writing since the appointment of a new artistic director, Sabato De Sarno, at the beginning of 2023, and the ""rationalization"" of its distribution, something intended to strengthen sales under the brand.This luxury brand – accounting for half of Kering's global business in 2022 – posted a 7% drop in third-quarter billings, on a like-for-like basis and at comparable exchange rates, compared with the same period last year. As Gucci is one of its most profitable brands, this underperformance is bound to affect the French group's operating margin in 2023, Kering's management agreed on Tuesday, October 24. Yves Saint-Laurent – the group's other major subsidiary – is also showing signs of weakness. Sales plunged by 12% in the third quarter.",/en/lifestyle/
"Paris Fashion Week sets the scene, from the Château de Vincennes to Invalides","    The major fashion houses are making their shows resonate with the Parisian venues that host them, to the point of making them a key element in their sartorial narrative. ","If there's one area in which Paris Fashion Week outstrips the competition, it's staging. Driven by brands with the means to match their ambitions, the French capital is rich in fashion shows set in prestigious historic locations, where the decor plays a real role in the sartorial narrative. This was once again demonstrated at the Spring-Summer 2024 edition, which ran until October 3.Loewe showcased at a château. On the esplanade of the Vincennes fortress stood a vast opaque tent where six bronze sculptures evoking strange snail shells broke up the space. They are by Lynda Benglis, the American postminimalist artist who, in the 1970s, created live sculptures in galleries to highlight the creative process. This approach is similar to that of designer Jonathan Anderson, who likes to emphasize the artisanal dimension of his garments.The collection opened with a series of knitted capes, with stitches so large as to appear zoomed in, as if viewed through a microscope. This was followed by wool Bermuda shorts fastened with an XXL needle, symbolizing the designer's work. Jonathan Anderson had fun making legs look endless with pants whose waistband was so high it almost reached the chest, or a flesh-colored polo shirt with a print that was impossible to tell if it was transparent or a reproduction of flesh.""This collection really represents Lynda at every moment of her life,"" explained the designer. ""The hypersexualization in Artforum [a magazine in which the artist, in 1974, appeared naked with a dildo between her legs], the success, the moment when she broke the rules..."" It's a welcome heterogeneity, in which the most experimental pieces gave food for thought and the more classical ones aroused desire.At the Célestins barracks, headquarters of the Republican Guard, a branch of the French Gendarmerie that carries out formal and security missions, another tent was in place. Hermès' guests made their way between ears of corn and field flowers, a meadow in full springtime bloom. ""It's the simple theme of the picnic, an invitation to get away that can happen at home, in the garden,"" explained Nadège Vanhée. The picnic was subtly evoked by small-checked dresses that can be used as tablecloths; a dress with embroidered white straps, reminiscent of household linen; and a gigantic smooth leather basket-bag capable of holding all kinds of food.Above all, the picnic offered a poetic setting for imagining the ideal summer wardrobe in Hermès shades, sumptuous gradations of red, taupe, white and black. A bra, halter top, bolero, short shorts and openwork leather skirt revealed the skin. Models were at ease in leather-covered stretch knits, drawstrings allowed trouser closures to be adjusted, snaps allowed the upper part of a skirt to be removed and sandals featured grippy soles. ""I want to make clothes that can go through the different stages of life, that are modular and that adapt to the body,"" Vanhée elaborated. ""And it's up to women to choose how they wear them. It's not in keeping with our times to impose the diktat of one silhouette."" Which doesn't mean they can't all be attractive.Bird chirping at Hermès was followed by ominous croaks at Alexander McQueen's Carreau du Temple, a former covered market transformed into a cultural venue, decorated with four monumental works by Magdalena Abakanowicz, a Polish artist whose organic textile sculptures are inspired by the animal and plant world. She is ""a transgressive and powerfully creative artist who refused to ever compromise her vision,"" summed up Sarah Burton. This was the designer's last show for the brand she had worked at for 26 years, first as Alexander McQueen's right-hand woman, then, on his death in 2012, as artistic director.A reference to Abakanowicz's frayed fabrics can be seen in the red bangs sewn onto the bib of a black suit, which continue down the sleeves, or in skirts where the silk threads are not woven together but aligned and held together by viscose panels that structure the whole. The anatomy of the female body, another theme of this collection, can be seen on a white dress embroidered with threads representing the digestive organs and lymphatic system, and on a sculptural dress where ruffles, slits and gradations of color evoke the female sex. As always, the garments are openwork, revealing the ribs, part of the back or the chest.This very ""McQueenesque"" collection testifies to Burton's desire to leave without making waves, even if emotions ran high when she greeted and embraced François-Henri Pinault (CEO of Kering, which owns the label), Anna Wintour and actresses Cate Blanchett and Elle Fanning. Her departure signals the end of an era, since it is unlikely that her successor will be as close to the founder as Burton was. Kering, which went through a delicate period with the Balenciaga crisis in December 2022 (designer Demna was criticized for using children in an advertising campaign) and Gucci's disappointing results, undoubtedly has plans to give the brand new impetus. With a history as rich as McQueen's, this will be no easy task.Yet the Balenciaga show seemed to prove that anything is possible, even rising from the ashes. In another huge tent, set up at Les Invalides, Demna imagined a theatrical set, composed only of immense garnet velvet curtains. Isabelle Huppert's voice read the entirety of a ""Guide to the traditional assembly of a suit jacket,"" reminding us how much work goes into making a simple jacket. At the last show in March, which came after the controversy, immersing himself in the making of pretty clothes helped the designer regain his footing. ""Afterward, I said to myself that this collection was too polished, it didn't look like me,"" said Demna. ""That's when I stopped thinking about other people and did what I liked.""On the catwalk, his mother opened the show and his husband closed it in a wedding dress. In between, were friends, colleagues and a few models. The notion of couture was ever-present through the deconstruction and reconstruction of vintage pieces: five evening dresses merged into a turquoise sheath that was turned upside down, reassembled raincoats became a four-sleeved trench coat and pieces of denim transformed into patchwork pants steeped in history.Everywhere was amusing trompe-l'œil, from a wallet that looked like a passport with a train ticket tucked inside, to a flowery leather dress that looked like it was cut from oilcloth. And there was an abundance of details that made a normal silhouette special, such as formal jackets inlaid with pleats or coats with a wide, flattened stature because they had no shoulder pads to add volume. The collection was both striking and absolutely recognizable: This was Demna on the top of his game for Balenciaga. It remains to be seen whether the brand's customers still want it.Valentino took over the palais des études of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, inspired by Italian Renaissance palaces, and invited singer FKA Twigs to deliver a hybrid performance between dance and concert, in resonance with a collection designed to highlight the female body: ""A man can be a feminist in the same way as a woman,"" designer Pierpaolo Piccioli said. ""It's all about state of mind."" The Italian designer relied on short dresses, openwork fabrics and a particular technique, altorilievo (""high relief""), which involves assembling 3D floral embroidery to create a dress or coat. The sculpted effect was quite striking, and the technique also had the advantage of showing a lot of skin, because there's always a bit of empty space between two embroidered orchids or daisies.In addition to the perfectly executed technique, Piccioli's simple, effective wardrobe – T-shirt, white shirt, jeans – used precious materials that lend it nobility. In the Beaux-Arts building, where the vibrant voice of FKA Twigs resonated, there was nothing anodyne about it.",/en/lifestyle/
Alexander McQueen appoints Seán McGirr as creative director,"    The successor of Sarah Burton, who spent 26 years at the brand, has been named by Kering. Now, all of Kering's fashion houses are led by male creative directors. ","Everyone was expecting a woman, but in the end, the replacement is a man. Seán McGirr, an Irish designer previously unknown to the general public and little known to insiders, was appointed creative director of Alexander McQueen after Sarah Burton announced her surprise departure on September 11. Burton bowed out with panache (and a standing ovation) after 13 years in this strategic position – and 26 years in total with the brand – at the Spring/Summer 2024 show in Paris on September 30. Now, all of Kering's fashion houses are led by male creative directors.Francois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of Kering (the brand's owner said), ""Alexander McQueen is a house we are passionate about, and we are confident that Seán McGirr will be able to pursue its journey with a new creative impetus. We look forward to opening this new chapter in the history of this unique brand.""As far as the fashion world is concerned, McQueen holds a special place. First and foremost, this is due to the tortured and endearing personality of its founder, Lee Alexander McQueen, the British designer who took his own life in 2010 at the age of 40.A whole chapter of English fashion history has been written by him and his eponymous label, founded in 1992 and owned by Kering Group (formerly the Gucci Group) since 2000. His style was dreamlike and unique, expressed through richly referenced garments and shows that were always grandiose, sometimes even morbid. With panache, Sarah Burton, one of his closest collaborators, took up the torch.Now, let's make way for McGirr, 35. Just as Lee Alexander McQueen did, McGirr graduated from Central Saint Martins School, in 2014 with a master of arts in fashion. Up until recently, he was one of Jonathan Anderson's right-hand men, overseeing the men's and women's collections at the JW Anderson brand in London. He has also previously worked for Dries Van Noten and Burberry and cut his teeth at Uniqlo, on the U line under Christophe Lemaire.McGirr has joined the Kering Group's roster of creative directors, which include Anthony Vaccarello at Saint Laurent, Matthieu Blazy at Bottega Veneta and Sabato de Sarno at Gucci. It’s notable that the profile of de Sarno, who was hired at the beginning of the year, isn’t that different from McGirr's. He too had remained in the shadow of another high-profile designer at Valentino, Pierpaolo Piccioli, until his appointment. Kering is once again opting to hire an unproven second-stringer rather than poaching a seasoned designer from the competition.Gianfilippo Testa, managing director of Alexander McQueen said, ""We are delighted to welcome Seán McGirr as creative director. With his experience, personality and creative energy, he will bring a powerful creative language to Alexander McQueen while building on its unique heritage."" McQueen's legacy is long, aesthetically strong and emotionally charged, so the task will not be easy. Burton, who followed in McQueen's footsteps, was embraced by his devotees. The arrival of a new designer with no historical or emotional connection to McQueen will no doubt disappoint some of his faithful fans.Currently, McGirr's first collection for the brand has not been announced, but it is likely to take place during the Autumn-Winter 2024-2025 collections in Paris in February.",/en/lifestyle/
"Come for the culture, maybe don't stay for the food: Are museum restaurants worth a visit?","    With high prices and homogenized flavors in menus designed to please everyone, many restaurants run by renowned chefs fail to offer gastronomic delights that match the establishment's reputation. However, there are noteworthy exceptions. ","Stepping into the Musée Carnavalet's courtyard to dine at Fabula is a feast for the eyes. The temporary restaurant, open in summer, is surrounded by the impressive 16th-century facades of Parisian mansions, covered in ivy and bathed in a twilight orange-red light. We licked our lips at the prospect of trying out the cuisine of chef Julien Dumas, who has already worked culinary miracles at his restaurant in the 16th arrondissement, Saint James. Expectations were even higher as the press release promised a ""delicate ode to the vegetable."" In fact, it was so delicate you couldn't taste it. The Île-de-France peas in a gazpacho had no flavor. The rest of the menu was generally bland, including the bottarga, which was the last straw, considering the usual boldness of this fish roe. Everything was served in very expensive, minimalist portions (three tiny bites of mullet, €22) and cold.The reasons for this fiasco? The kitchen faces severe constraints: The restaurant has no extraction system and is reduced to assembling (combining pre-prepared or fresh food), with no cooking options. Dumas, who designed the menu, is rarely present and cannot effectively oversee the teams.Over the past 20 years, French museums have introduced restaurants, following the example of their British and American counterparts. Curators, who had long snubbed them to focus on their collections, saw them as a way to offset the drop in subsidies and cater to an audience that now wanted to eat on-site. There are no major museum institutions today that don't have one or more eateries, typically managed by catering professionals through multi-year concessions.This new playground quickly became a windfall. Laurent de Gourcuff, founder of Paris Society (which owns Monsieur Bleu at the Palais de Tokyo, Girafe at the Cité de l'Architecture et du Patrimoine and Coco at the Palais Garnier, among others), acknowledged that before the Covid lockdown, all his restaurants were generating around €10 million in annual sales. Earlier this year, the group opened a new cash cow, Dar Mima, inaugurated by Jamel Debbouze, on the roof of the Institut du Monde Arabe.The most prestigious museums are now partnering with renowned figures in the culinary world. In 2017, multi-starred chef Alain Ducasse even created a specific entity, Musiam (a contraction of musée, ""museum"" and miam, ""yum""), which manages a dozen outlets between the Château de Versailles, the Louvre, the Orangerie, the Quai Branly and the Musée d'Orsay. The offering ranges from croque-monsieur (€17 at Bistrot Benoît in the Louvre) to charcoal-grilled blue lobster (Les Ombres, at Quai Branly, on the €188 Floraison menu) and is very inconsistent.",/en/lifestyle/
"Post-Brexit, migrant farm workers in the UK increasingly come from Asia",Feature,"He has just placed another crate of strawberries in the back of the van. Before setting off again to keep up the pace of work, he takes a minute to explain his situation. This young man comes from Kyrgyzstan, where he was the director of a water purification project for a major development bank. How did he end up picking berries in Herefordshire, in the West of England? ""Here I earn in a week what I used to earn in a month back home. I'm here for the money.""Along with her husband, Christine Snell owns some 160 hectares planted with strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blackcurrants. New faces have been arriving in their fields in recent years. With Brexit and the end of free movement for European workers, she has to recruit from further afield – much further afield. ""Now they come from the 'stan' countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan,"" she explained. Central Asia is replacing Central Europe as the source of the labor needed to pick 1,000 tonnes of strawberries and keep the packaging plant running.At the height of summer, she needs almost 300 people; in the depths of winter, around 40 is enough. Most live on site in mobile homes for up to six months, the duration of their visa. They receive minimum wage (£10.42, or €12.10, an hour), plus a bonus that can of an extra 50% or more for the most productive workers, depending on the quantity of fruit picked.In the fields, a subtle hierarchy of nationalities has now set in. At the top are the Europeans, who arrived before Brexit and have obtained settled status, which gives them the right to stay in the UK. Many, like Ion Avram, a Romanian who has been coming to Snell’s farm for 19 years, spend the winter in their country of origin and return every summer at harvest time. Below them in the pecking order are the newcomers. Most don't speak a word of English, leading to communication challenges. ""I speak a little Russian, they do too, and we manage to understand each other in that language,"" Avram explained. ""It's hard work, but I come back every year for the money,"" said this veterinarian by training, whose 6-year-old son is waiting for him to return to Romania.British agriculture is facing a severe labor shortage. ""Access to migrant labor has been crucial for filling labor gaps in the food supply chain but acquiring migrant labor has become increasingly challenging,"" warned John Shropshire, chairman of G's Fresh, a major agri-food group, in June in a report on the subject submitted to the British government. The UK, he points out, is not alone in this problem: ""Our international and European counterparts face similar obstacles as they expand their search for labor beyond local regions."" However, in addition to the UK’s 4% unemployment rate and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, which have caused many employees to distance themselves from work, ""reduced access to workers from the European Union [has] contributed to this problem,"" the report noted.",/en/global-issues/
"In New York, a showcase for French arts and crafts",Feature,"In late September, the Payne Whitney Mansion, located at 972 5th Avenue in New York, was given a facelift. On the top floor of this splendid granite mansion overlooking Central Park was inaugurated the Atelier, a modular space designed to host exhibitions, receptions, dinners and conferences and to promote the arts and crafts.The French Ministry of Culture defined them as the ""handcrafted manual trades"" that ""make use of traditional, highly technical and often exceptional skills."" A large number of economic sectors rely on them, including luxury goods, fashion, architecture and interior design, and these crafts are very popular in the United States.""In New York, this ecosystem of French arts and crafts is developing strongly, and this project will enable them to shine even more brightly,"" explained Gaëtan Bruel, a young civil servant who arrived in 2019 to head the cultural services of the French embassy, which he left in October to join the minister of education's staff.The majestic Italian neo-Renaissance building on 5th Avenue, built in the early 20th century and bought by the French state in the 1950s, is no stranger to welcoming the public. Especially since September 26, 2014, when Albertine, a French bookshop, opened on the ground floor. Its singularity lies in offering French-language books and, above all, French books translated into English. As for the name Albertine, it is a reference to the character in Marcel Proust's novel. This venue has always been a vibrant meeting place.""We present many French authors who come to do signings and take part in discussions or festivals, either in the bookshop or in the reception areas on the second floor,"" explained François Bridey, a cultural services attaché at the French embassy. The building is also home to the Villa Albertine program, created in early 2021 at Bruel's instigation to enable young and established French artists from all creative fields to come to the US to carry out a specific project.But not all spaces of the building were occupied. Especially the top floor, where one of the building's former owners, the wealthy Helen Hay Whitney, liked to write and entertain friends. All that remained of this cozy shelter's former splendor was the terracotta floor with its heraldic motifs and the medieval-inspired painted wooden ceiling. ""When I arrived in 2019, I came up with the idea of restoring this room with a French touch and using design as well as craftsmanship to connect French creation and the history of this place,"" said Bruel. ""We therefore launched a consultation in July 2022 to transform it into a functional showcase for French talent.""",/en/lifestyle/
The Gaza Strip: 20 years of Le Monde covering this increasingly inaccessible territory,"    Correspondents describe the particular context of the Palestinian enclave, which despite experiencing four conflicts between 2008 and 2021, has received less attention from the media than the West Bank. ","For several days, between the morning of Friday, October 27, and Tuesday, October 30, Le Monde had no news from Hassan Jaber, the newspaper's veteran fixer in the Gaza Strip. Jaber is one of those seasoned professionals, over 60 years old, who has accompanied nearly half a dozen of the publication's correspondents through not only the geography of the Palestinian enclave, but also the political complexities of Hamas, the Islamist party that has administered this small territory since 2007. Without him, much of Le Monde's reporting in recent years would not have been possible. He and his family have been trapped under intensive Israeli bombing for the past three weeks.Since October 7 and the Hamas terrorist operations in Israel, no journalist has been able to enter the Gaza Strip. The area is completely sealed off by the Jewish state, which has deployed its army all along and to the north of the enclave. To the south, Egypt is not letting the press through either.In Jerusalem, our journalist Clothilde Mraffko spends long hours every day waiting for calls, text messages and the odd video from Palestinian colleagues in Gaza, but also from contacts she has made there over the years. ""It's exhausting work,"" she said. ""Not only do people in Gaza communicate as and when they can, depending on internet connections and if they can find a way to recharge their mobile phones since electricity was cut off on October 9, but they have often lost loved ones in the bombings. More than just the precise information they tell me, I'm often one of their rare outside contacts, with whom they can open up a little.""Outside the enclave, in Israeli territory, photographers stand a few hundred meters from the barbed wire and walls that enclose the Gaza Strip. This is the only spot from which they can capture the black smoke of burnt-out buildings and the ruins of neighborhoods destroyed by the bombings. Gaza City is only an hour from Tel Aviv, not much more from Jerusalem, and yet it's as if two separate worlds had been created. How can we be sure of what's going on inside Gaza?Even before this violent conflict, journalistic coverage of the open-air prison that is the Gaza Strip had been challenged since the early 2000s by Israeli military incursions, bombings, blockades of the enclave, bureaucracy, censorship and the conflicting interests of the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority and, since 2007, Hamas.All of Le Monde's correspondents for the past 20 years remember the Erez border crossing point between Israel and the Gaza Strip, the construction of which began during the second Intifada (2000-2005): Like an enormous airport terminal, where Israeli soldiers observed journalists, diplomats and Palestinians with work permits from desks high above the ground, speaking to them over a loudspeaker.",/en/about-us/
Mafia boss and ruthless killer Matteo Messina Denaro dies aged 61,"    Suffering from incurable cancer, this Toto Riina devotee, directly implicated in dozens of murders, was arrested in Palermo in January after three decades on the run. His death at the age of 61 was announced on Monday. ","In the summer of 1993 and with the Italian police hot on his heels, a love letter from 30-year-old Matteo Messina Denaro signaled the start of his flight ""You'll hear about me, they'll paint me as a devil, but it'll all be lies,"" he wrote to his then-girlfriend Angela in farewell. Overnight, Sicily's most feared young mafia boss became a ghost.For the next 30 years, this brutal man with the reputation of a playboy would elude investigators with the same virtuosity as his favorite comic-book hero, Diabolik, who he took his nickname from. Italy knew him by the photograph on his wanted poster for murders, bombings, arms and drug trafficking: an angular face, shrouded in mystery, hidden behind smoked glasses. This was the face of a ruthless killer, who became the symbol of superlatitanti, the most elusive bosses.Suffering from cancer, 61-year-old Messina Denaro died in hospital, as reported by the ANSA agency on Monday, September 25. Several dozen police used to stand guard around the room of the former ""Godfather"" in the San Salvatore hospital in L'Aquila (Abruzzo).Eight months earlier, on January 16, it was precisely by following the trail of his colon tumor that investigators finally managed to arrest Italy's most notorious fugitive, while he was on his way to a medical consultation, under an assumed identity, at a clinic in Palermo. This ended the career of a man who had never before set foot in a prison cell, or even the dock in a court.Messina Denaro's criminal destiny was rooted in Castelvetrano, in the Sicilian province of Trapani, where he was born on April 26, 1962. Although the fourth of six siblings (and the second son), he grew up as an heir, programmed to succeed his father, Francesco, known as Don Ciccio. A simple farmer, according to his identity papers, ""Ciccio"" was in reality the mafia boss of this region of western Sicily. A silent man, he was allied to the Corleones, who became the new masters of the island in the early 1980s, at the cost of a bloodbath. At their head was Toto Riina, the ""capo dei capi,"" also nicknamed ""La Belva"" (""the beast"").It was the ""beast"" himself who mentored young Matteo and propelled him into the Cosa Nostra elite. Riina taught this promising boy, initially nicknamed ""U Seccu"" (""the skinny one"") because of his wiry figure, the art of scheming as well as express killings. Using a Walther P38, the ambitious young man proved his worth. He even exceeded his master's expectations, but also broke the rules of the old-school ""men of honor,"" who were generally discreet and rather austere. Messina Denaro was a gambler. He went to discos, drove a Porsche, paraded around in Versace suits, scarf around his neck, gold watch on his wrist.",/en/global-issues/
Macron and Meloni meet in Rome amid tensions over migration,    The French leader was in Italy to attend former president Giorgio Napolitano's state funeral. A sharp rise in migrant landings to the Italian island of Lampedusa has reignited a bitter debate across the EU. ,"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni held talks on Tuesday, September 26, with French President Emmanuel Macron in Rome, against a backdrop of tensions between the two countries over migration.The French leader was in the Italian capital to attend the state funeral of former president Giorgio Napolitano, who died on Friday aged 98. A sharp rise in migrant landings to the Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month reignited a bitter debate across the EU over who takes responsibility for asylum seekers.There has been particularly heated rhetoric in France, where political parties in the country's hung parliament are wrangling over a draft law governing new arrivals.""We cannot leave the Italians alone,"" Macron said in a television interview on Sunday – an offer of help that Meloni immediately said she ""welcomed with great interest."" The two leaders last met in Paris in June, and are also both due at a summit of Mediterranean leaders in Malta on Friday.Meloni has also clashed over migration with Germany, whose president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was also among those at Napolitano's funeral. The Italian premier wrote to Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the weekend to complain about Berlin's funding of charity projects to help migrants either at sea or onshore in Italy.Rome blames the NGO boats that conduct rescue missions in the central Mediterranean – the world's deadliest sea crossing for migrants – for encouraging arrivals from North Africa. But data shows they do not work as a so-called pull factor, departures are based on the weather not the presence of NGO boats and the vast majority of migrants are rescued by the Italian coastguard, according to the Interior Ministry.Napolitano was a former communist who became the first Italian president to serve a second term. Renowned for his moderation and statesmanship, he was regarded as a guarantor of stability during a time of particular turbulence in Italian politics. In office from 2006 to 2015, he was president during the premierships of Romano Prodi, Silvio Berlusconi, Mario Monti, Enrico Letta and Matteo Renzi.Representatives from Albania, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Britain and the European Union were also announced among the guest list for the funeral. Unusually for Italy, Napolitano had asked to have a non-religious ceremony, which was held in the lower house of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies.",/en/global-issues/
JPMorgan to pay $75 million on claims it enabled Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operations,"    The bank is paying the settlement to the US Virgin Islands, where the late American financier had an estate. The Virgin Islands said JPMorgan enabled Epstein's recruiters to pay victims. ","JPMorgan Chase agreed on Tuesday, September 26, to pay $75 million to the US Virgin Islands to settle claims that the bank enabled the sex trafficking acts committed by financier Jeffrey Epstein.JPMorgan said that $55 million of the settlement will go toward local charities and assistance for victims. Another $20 million will go toward legal fees.The Virgin Islands, where Epstein had an estate, sued JPMorgan last year, saying its investigation revealed that the financial services giant enabled Epstein’s recruiters to pay victims and was ""indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise.""In effect, the Virgin Islands had argued that JPMorgan had been complicit in Epstein's behavior and did not raise any red flags to law enforcement or bank regulators about Epstein being a ""high risk"" customer and making repeated large cash withdrawals.The bank also said it reached a confidential legal settlement with James ""Jes"" Staley, the former top JPMorgan executive who managed the Epstein account before leaving the bank. JPMorgan sued Staley earlier this year, alleging that he covered up or minimized Epstein's wrongdoing in order to maintain the lucrative account.JPMorgan had already agreed to pay $290 million in June in a class-action lawsuit that involved victims of Epstein's trafficking crimes.

UK interior minister Braverman questions role of UN refugee convention,    UK minister Suella Braverman asked in a speech in the United States on Tuesday whether the UN Refugee Convention was 'fit' for the 'modern age'. ,"UK interior minister Suella Braverman on Tuesday, September 26, questioned whether the United Nations Refugee Convention was ""fit for our modern age"" during a keynote speech at a think-tank in Washington.The speech at the center-right American Enterprise Institute intended to lay out an international plan to deal with the refugee crisis, a key political issue for her struggling Conservative party back home. Braverman called the 1951 Refugee Convention, which legally defines the term ""refugee"" and outlines their rights, ""an incredible achievement of its age"".""But more than 70 years on, we now live in a completely different time,"" she said, citing a study that says the convention now gives at least 780 million people the potential right to move to another country.""It is therefore incumbent upon politicians and thought leaders to ask whether the Refugee Convention, and the way it has come to be interpreted through our courts, is fit for our modern age or in need of reform,"" she said.Western countries will not be able to sustain an asylum system ""if in effect simply being gay, or a woman, or fearful of discrimination in your country of origin, is sufficient to qualify for protection"", she added. ""We are living in a new world bound by outdated legal models. It's time we acknowledge that.""The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said the convention was ""the cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime and remains a life-saving instrument"".It added that the convention ""remains as relevant today as when it was adopted in providing an indispensable framework for addressing"" the challenges presented by the irregular movement of refugees.Brexit pressureThe UK government is currently languishing in the polls and has been struggling to stem the flow since Brexit of migrant boat crossings from mainland Europe. Almost 24,000 people have made the trip this year, adding to a record backlog in asylum claims and heaping pressure on ministers who promised to ""take back control"" of UK borders after leaving the European Union. Controversial proposals to tackle the issue include criminalising irregular migration and sending failed asylum seekers for resettlement in Rwanda.Braverman, a lawyer who has criticised the European Convention on Human Rights for blocking the government's Rwanda scheme, said that a system where ""people are able to travel through multiple safe countries... while they pick and choose their preferred destination to claim asylum, is absurd and unsustainable"".But the non-profit Refugee Council said the UK should instead be ""addressing the real issues in the asylum system, such as the record backlog, and providing safe routes for those in need of protection"" rather than taking aim at the UN convention.Yvette Cooper, home affairs spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, accused Braverman of having ""given up on fixing the Tories' asylum chaos"" and ""looking for anyone else to blame"".During her visit to the United States, Braverman is due to meet Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland for talks on migration and other topics.",/en/global-issues/
"Lampedusa, at the gates of Fortress Europe",Feature,"With its stern turned away from the blue sea of late September, the Adriana returned to the port of Lampedusa. Topped by two dummy masts, the motorized replica of an imaginary pirate ship was back after the day's excursion. On the small Italian island, the tourist season was still in full swing and, in less than two hours, the ship would be taking on more holidaymakers for the evening tour, complete with aperitif, swimming under the stars and dolphin-watching. But as the toy-like boat made its way into the channel, another boat caught the attention of its swimsuit-clad passengers. Coming in from the open sea, beyond the turquoise coves, an Italian coastguard launch slowly crossed its path, carrying a compact mass of men and women, perhaps also children, whose arms, legs and life jackets could be made out. The two boats followed each other into Lampedusa harbor, dragging two parallel Mediterraneans in their wake.The Favaloro pier, where migrants arrive after a long journey, is off-limits. No one will hear about how their personal stories collided with the outside world. This port is merely a stopping point on the way to a more distant exile. It's a milestone already reached by tens of thousands of others this year, people who left Tunisia to cross the sea to Lampedusa. In the harbor are the things they left behind: a floating graveyard of worn fishing boats, inflatable dinghies, rusting hulls made of welded metal plates, as precarious as they are numerous along the ""Tunisian route,"" coming from the Sfax region, which is where the majority of people leave from.Surrounded by nurses, two women from the speedboat made their way with difficulty along the quayside. Television cameras, held at a distance on the roof of a shed, were trained on them. Their faces hidden under a veil, they disappeared into a medical tent. Following four ""disembarkations,"" according to the current terminology,  on Monday, September 18, 530 people were transported from the port to the island's reception center called the ""hotspot,"" a blind spot where exiles usually stay for a night or two, before being evacuated by plane or boat to Sicily or mainland Italy.If there weren't so many journalists there, it would be a perfectly ordinary day in Lampedusa, where more than 60,000 migrants – mostly from sub-Saharan Africa – have transited since the beginning of June, according to figures from the Italian Red Cross. The presence of cameras testifies to the intensity of the crisis the previous week, which saw the careful logistics designed to keep Lampedusa's two realities apart briefly collapse.",/en/global-issues/
Migrants in Cyprus fear fresh violence after a wave of racist far-right attacks,Feature,"In the city of Limassol, on Cyprus' southern coast, life and business have returned to the multi-ethnic shops on the waterfront that were targeted in early September by anti-migrant attacks. A ransacked Vietnamese grocery store was reopening, Egyptian restaurants – whose windows were still shattered – were preparing grilled meats and a handful of men smoked hookah in a Syrian café. At night, Arab and Asian customers were getting haircuts from two Syrian hairdressers while Nepalese and Indian migrants met up for dinner in a small cafe.Nonetheless, ""it's not like it used to be,"" said a Nepalese woman who wished to remain anonymous. ""I really liked Cyprus: Every community had its own customs, and we all felt safe. Today, I live in fear of a repeat of the attacks."" The young widow has been supporting her daughter, who stayed behind in Nepal with relatives.""Syrian folks used to come and cool off in the evenings on the beach. It's a beautiful place, free of charge. Ever since the attacks they haven't come anymore. I used to feel comfortable in Cyprus, but now I'm wondering if I should leave,"" said Taysir Ramadan, a Syrian man who has lived in Cyprus for 15 years, where he ran a men's hair salon. He had saved CCTV images in his phone, capturing the explosion of hatred on the night of September 1: One of his employees can be seen dozing on a bench in front of the closed store. A group of men in hoodies come into view, beat him up, and then smash the shop window. Then one of them throws a Molotov cocktail into the store, which bursts into flames. ""It took a week of work to restore the place,"" said Taysir ruefully, estimating the damage at over €14,000.The wave of violence had been preceded by a demonstration on the waterfront, under the slogan ""Refugees not welcome."" Between 150 and 200 black-clad people participated, with many concealing their faces. Most of the foreign shopkeepers, who had often taken out loans to start their businesses, opted to close early. Some who lived nearby witnessed the scenes of destruction with their hearts pounding. ""I was in a room above the grocery store. I warned my mother not to come home, that it was dangerous,"" said Flora, a 17-year-old Vietnamese woman. ""We were minutes away from being killed,"" said Moustapha, a young Syrian hairdresser, still reeling from the fires of the Molotov cocktails. Witnesses have called out the apathetic police reaction that night.In the wake of the ransacking – which mainly targeted Arab shops – a series of racist beatings took place, lasting several days. Asian and African motor-scooter deliverymen, who can be seen waiting all over Limassol's old town outside restaurants and cafés popular with tourists and young Cypriots, were beaten up. ""At around 10 in the evening, some men came up to me carrying sticks and metal chains. They said 'go back to your country, we don't want you here,' and then beat me up. I was terrified. This is the third time I've been attacked in Limassol,"" said Larry Angeh.

At least 10 Cuban migrants killed in truck accident in Mexico,    The incident is the latest in a series of migrant deaths in Mexico amid a surge in migrants traveling toward the US border. ,"At least 10 Cuban migrants were killed and 25 injured on Sunday, October 1, when a cargo truck carrying them overturned in southern Mexico, the latest fatal crash involving US-bound migrants, local officials reported. The accident took place in southern Chiapas state, near the border with Guatemala, the report said. A source in the prosecutor's office who spoke on grounds of anonymity told AFP the victims were apparently from Cuba and all were women, including one minor.The accident occurred on a highway along the Pacific coast between the towns of Pijijiapan and Tonala, where migrants often travel as they attempt to reach the United States – part of a flow drawing increasingly urgent attention in Washington. The truck, its body built partly of wood, was destroyed, with the migrants' clothes, bags and backpacks strewn around it.On Thursday, two migrants died when a truck overturned in the Chiapas municipality of Mezcalapa. Thousands of migrants from different countries have been traveling across Mexico in cramped buses, trailers and freight trains – or on foot – in an attempt to reach the United States. In early August, at least 18 people died and another 23 were injured after a bus with local passengers and migrants from countries such as India, the Dominican Republic and some African nations plunged into a ravine in the state of Nayarit.This weekend, in the northern states of Chihuahua and Zacatecas, nearly 3,000 migrants were stranded in isolated areas when the freight trains they were traveling on inexplicably stopped. Mexican authorities said they had detained more than 189,000 migrants last month, while the US border patrol has reported 1.8 million apprehensions between October 2022 and August 2023.With the influx of migrants ""overwhelming"" Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has called on his US counterpart for ""help."" On Friday, Washington and Mexico City pledged to redouble their efforts to strengthen economic and security cooperation on migration issues, as well as drug and arms trafficking.Republican lawmakers in Washington have grown increasingly angered by the migrant arrivals and have called on President Joe Biden's administration to do more to address the issue. After passing a last-minute measure on Saturday to avoid a US government shutdown, Republican leaders have expressed a willingness to block any additional funding for Ukraine's war effort unless more is spent on the border.""I'm going to make sure that the weapons are provided for Ukraine,"" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, ""but they're not going to get some big package if the border is not secure."" He did not define what it would take for him to consider the border as being ""secure.""",/en/global-issues/
300 migrants arrive in Spain's Canary islands by boat,    It marks the largest number of migrants to arrive on a single boat to the archipelago. The migratory route to Canary Islands has been particularly busy the last few years due to tighter controls in the Mediterranean. ,"A boat carrying 280 migrants landed on Tuesday, October 3, in Spain's Canary Islands, having crossed one of the most dangerous migratory routes in the Atlantic, a rescue organization told Agence France-Presse (AFP). It marks the largest number of migrants to arrive on a single boat to the archipelago, the rescue group said. The migrants consisted of 278 men including 10 boys plus two women, and are of sub-Saharan origin, according to rescuers who aided them on their arrival.Spain, and in particular the Canary archipelago off the coast of Africa, is one of the main gateways into Europe for irregular migrants. Spanish media reports said the vessel reached the port of La Restinga on the small island of El Hierro some 450 kilometers off the African coast. On Tuesday alone, El Hierro saw some 500 migrants land on its shores. Emergency services reported another boat arriving with 79 migrants while 127 others were rescued from sea.The Canaries saw 14,976 migrants arrive between January 1 and September 30, an increase of 19.8% compared with the same period in 2022, according to the latest figures from Spain's Interior Ministry.In recent years, the migratory route to the Canary Islands has been particularly busy due to tighter controls in the Mediterranean. Shipwrecks are frequent, as the crossing is particularly dangerous. NGOs regularly report fatal shipwrecks in Moroccan, Spanish and international waters, with unofficial estimates putting the death toll in the dozens, if not hundreds.Since the beginning of this year, 140 migrants have died or disappeared along this crossing, according to data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) from early September.The Spanish NGO Caminando Fronteras, which unlike the IOM relies on emergency calls from those at sea or their relatives, estimates that 778 migrants died or disappeared on this migration route in the first half of the year.",/en/global-issues/
Malta summit urges more EU action to stop migration at source,    A sharp rise in migrants landing on the Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month has reignited tensions within the bloc and provided impetus to work for a fresh common strategy. ,"The leaders of nine Mediterranean and southern European countries called Friday, September 29, for a ""significant increase"" in the EU's efforts to tackle the thorny issue of migration at its roots, in origin and transit countries.Italian far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that front-line countries were struggling to deal with arrivals now, but without ""structural"" solutions from the bloc, ""everyone will be overwhelmed.""A sharp rise in migrants landing on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month has reignited tensions within the bloc and provided impetus to work for a fresh common strategy.French President Emmanuel Macron called for ""a united European response,"" urging ""solidarity with Italy, as we must show solidarity with all the countries of first entry.""The ""Med 9"" leaders met in Malta the day after EU interior ministers in Brussels finally made headway on new rules for how the bloc handles asylum seekers and illegal immigration.The revamped Pact on Migration and Asylum will seek to relieve pressure on frontline countries by relocating some arrivals to other EU states and the ""Med 9"" urged its adoption as soon as possible.But Meloni, whose hard-right government was elected a year ago on an anti-migrant ticket, said the redistribution of arriving migrants was not enough – a message reiterated in the ""Med 9"" joint statement.Tackling illegal migration calls for ""a sustained and holistic European response,"" the leaders of Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Slovenia and a representative of Spain said.""We recall the need for a significant increase in the EU's efforts on the external dimension front, with a renewed approach to effectively reduce primary movements and prevent departures,"" it said.After a meeting with Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Malta, Meloni told media she saw ""a will, on paper at least,"" to act as a bloc.It is ""something that has to be done on a European level to be really effective,"" she insisted.So far this year, the number of arrivals in Italy has surpassed 133,000, almost double the number during the same period last year, official data shows.As thousands of migrants slept on cots in the open air in Lampedusa's overwhelmed reception center two weeks ago, von der Leyen unveiled a 10-point plan to help Rome deal with the crisis.Von der Leyen's plan includes the possible expansion of naval missions in the Mediterranean – missions Meloni said should be run ""in agreement with North African authorities"".The European Commission said last week it was set to release the first installment of funds to Tunisia – one of the main launching points for boats – under a plan signed this year to bolster its coastguard and tackle traffickers.The EU deal with Tunisia is already producing ""very important signs of collaboration"", Meloni said, adding that it provides ""a model to be used in general with North African countries"".The bloc already signed a deal in 2017 with Libya, although critics say getting both countries to intercept and forcibly return boats makes the EU complicit in abuses.Rescue charity Sea Watch said Friday its surveillance plane Seabird had witnessed a Libyan coastguard boat – a vessel gifted by Italy – ramming a migrant dinghy carrying some 50 people.The charity said it was not clear whether any of the migrants had drowned in the ""violent"" incident.At least 990 migrants died or went missing in the crossing between June and August this year, three times the number recorded in the same period last year, the UN's agency for children UNICEF said Friday.At least 289 children have died so far this year trying to make the crossing, with UNICEF warning the Mediterranean had become a ""cemetery for children and their future"".Rome has criticized Germany for funding charity rescue ships operating in the Central Mediterranean, the world's deadliest sea crossing for migrants.Italy has suggested charity ships sailing under foreign flags should be forced under EU rules to disembark them in their own countries, Meloni said Friday.But according to Italian media reports, that amendment was rejected by interior ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday.The ""Med 9"" leaders also urged ""immediate action"" on the climate crisis, following a devastating earthquake in Morocco, flood disaster in Libya, and extreme weather events in Southern Europe.Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called for ""much more emphasis on adaptation, disaster relief and managing the very costly aftermath.""",/en/global-issues/
Pope Francis opens Vatican meeting on the Church's future,"    From Wednesday, bishops and lay people will take part in a month-long synod to discuss how the institution functions in the future, the last major opportunity for 87-year-old Pope Francis to leave his mark on the Church. ","The 364 members of the synod opted for silence and prayer before beginning discussions on the future of the Catholic Church. On Saturday, September 30, after an ecumenical prayer celebrated by Pope Francis accompanied by the heads of other Christian Churches in St. Peter's Square, the members traveled to Sacrofano, some 20 kilometers from Rome. For four days, they went on a retreat to prepare for the mission entrusted to them by Francis.Church governance, the ordination of married men, the place of women and the laity, and the management of sexual violence committed by members of the clergy: The key topics that the faithful have put on the table and that this assembly will have to debate are likely to shake up the institution. Launched in 2021 by the pope, this ""synod on synodality,"" in Catholic terminology, aims to place the faithful at the center of the Church's functioning, in a context overshadowed by the vocations crisis in part of the world and by the ever-growing reports of sexual scandals. For Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the pope who will soon be 87, the aim is nothing less than to ""germinate dreams in the Church."" This summit meeting, which will be followed by a second one in a year's time, could be the last major opportunity of his pontificate to forge his legacy.In many ways, the process that will conclude in 2024 is historic. For the first time, lay people, including women, are being called upon not only to discuss but also to deliberate alongside the bishops to whom synods are usually reserved. Of the 365 voters (364 without Pope Francis), the assembly includes 96 lay people, 54 of them women. Among them is French nun Nathalie Becquart, under-secretary of the synod, one of the highest-ranking women in the Holy See.While the bishops were elected by their episcopal conference and the religious chosen by their order, some members were appointed by the Pope himself. Among them are Spanish theologian Cristina Inoges Sanz, renowned for her studies in so-called feminist theology, and American Jesuit priest James Martin, known for his defense of the inclusion of homosexuals in the Church.The Synod is also historic in that it is the result of a consultation unlike any that has taken place in the past. The faithful from all over the world gathered in their parishes to send in their contributions on how they felt the Church should function to keep pace with the times. Their writings were then grouped first by country, then by continent, before being sent to Rome. Based on this feedback, the Holy See produced a working document containing questions on which synod members are invited to collaborate. After the second session, in 2024, Francis is expected to formulate in a text the conclusions he has drawn for the Church from this process.",/en/global-issues/
EU states reach deal on migration reforms,    Wednesday's deal would involve setting up processing centers on the EU's outside borders and includes the option to detain people until their asylum claims are assessed. ,"European Union countries on Wednesday, October 4, overcame a major obstacle in their yearslong quest to overhaul the bloc's asylum rules amid warnings that time is running out to clinch agreement on the entire scheme before next year's EU elections.EU envoys clinched a deal on a ""crisis regulation"" of extraordinary measures that a country could take in the event of a massive, unforeseen movement of migrants toward its borders. It means that the 27 member states now have a negotiating position to take into talks with the EU parliament.Wednesday's deal would involve setting up processing centers on the EU's outside borders where people would be screened when they arrive and includes the option to detain people until their asylum claims are assessed.""Today we have achieved a huge step forward on a critical issue for the future of the EU,"" said Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska, whose country currently holds the bloc's rotating presidency. He said it could allow the EU to seal the so-called New Pact on Asylum and Migration by year's end.The pact was touted as the answer to the EU's migration woes when it was made public in September 2020. The bloc's old rules collapsed in 2015 after well over 1 million people arrived in Europe without authorization. Most were fleeing war in Syria or Iraq. But little progress was made on the pact as the member states bickered over which country should take charge of migrants when they arrive and whether other countries should be obligated to help.Instead, the EU focused on outsourcing the challenge by clinching morally questionable agreements with countries that people leave or transit to get to Europe. A deal with Tunisia, where authorities have been accused of dumping migrants in the desert, was the latest example.The clock is ticking on the whole asylum deal. Elections will be held across the EU in June. For the scheme to enter force, officials and lawmakers say, an agreement on all its 10 parts must be reached between the member countries and parliament by February.A new European Commission and European Parliament will start work next year and they may want to modify the pact, raising the risk that it might unravel. Countries with anti-migrant governments – Hungary, first, then Poland – will take over the EU presidency after the polls.""Time is running out. In a few months there will be elections. We need the pact done and dusted before Europeans go out to vote,"" commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas told lawmakers in Strasbourg, France. ""The whole of Europe is now watching us,"" he said. ""If we fail then we will give fuel to the false claims made by the enemies of democracy, by Russian disinformation, that Europe is incapable of managing migration.""Schinas and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are part of the conservative European People's Party, the biggest bloc in the EU parliament. They want to woo the party of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni into the fold and have taken a tougher line on migrants recently.Human rights organizations are concerned about the EU's approach to its migration pact. ""It is vital that the rush to reach an agreement does not lead to human rights being side-lined in the process. We fully expect all EU institutions to insist that these rights are guaranteed as negotiations advance in the coming months,"" said Eve Geddie, director of Amnesty International's EU office.",/en/global-issues/
Greenland victims demand justice over forced IUD scandal,"    In the late 1960s, Danish doctors inserted intrauterine devices (IUDs) into approximately 50% of Greenland's women, sometimes without their consent. The aim was to reduce the archipelago's birth rate. ","Naja Lyberth and her fellow fighters don't want to wait any longer. For decades, they have kept silent, convinced that they were alone, consumed by the same ""sense of shame and guilt"" that consumes victims of sexual violence. On Monday, October 2, 67 of them sent a letter to the Danish government, demanding 300,000 kroner (around €40,000) each in compensation for what the state did to them.The scandal broke in the spring of 2022. A year earlier, 60-year-old psychologist Lyberth had spoken about her experience to the Greenlandic women's magazine Arnanut. She recounted the day in 1976 when she and her schoolmates from Maniitsoq, a small island in western Greenland, were sent to hospital. There, a Danish doctor had fitted them with an intrauterine device (IUD), without even consulting their parents. Lyberth was 14. She had never had sexual intercourse. She still remembers the pain she felt when the IUD entered her vagina, then her uterus.""The state stole my virginity,"" was the accusation she made in the article, in which another woman gave a similar account. At the time, Lyberth thought there were only a few of them. In Greenland, silence reigned. ""The subject was taboo,"" she said. Some didn't even know they were wearing an IUD, and only discovered it years later when they went to see a gynecologist because they couldn't get pregnant.After reading the article, two Danish journalists, Anne Pilegaard Petersen and Celine Klint, decided to investigate. They discovered that the IUD operation was in fact part of a campaign by Copenhagen to ""modernize"" Greenland, which became a Danish province in 1953, rather than a colony. At the time, the archipelago had one of the highest birth rates in the world. In 1964, 1,674 births were recorded for a population of 37,600. This demographic explosion was costing Denmark dearly.Widespread use of contraception was presented as the solution to all problems, including women's freedom. Between 1966 and 1970, Danish doctors fitted 4,500 IUDs. There were 9,000 women of childbearing age. According to Lyberth, the fate of Greenland’s women was of little importance: ""In Denmark, parents had to give their consent for a doctor to insert an IUD on a minor, but this was not the case in Greenland. And while Danish women had a choice of contraceptives, we were forced to use a model that had been known since 1968 to be unsuitable for women who had never given birth.""The campaign was effective. By 1970, the birth rate had almost halved. But women were suffering. Many faced complications, forcing some to have their uterus removed. ""A number [of them] had ectopic pregnancies or were never able to get pregnant,"" revealed Lyberth, who eventually had a son at the age of 35.",/en/global-issues/
'We need to better compensate the work providing the greatest value for society',"Olivier De Schutter, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, argues that labor compensation should encompass more than just monetary gains and also acknowledge the impact of work on social well-being.","Europe is facing a purchasing power crisis of unprecedented proportions. In 2022, inflation averaged 9.6% in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and 9.2% in the European Union (EU), according to Eurostat. In the same timeframe, however, wages rose by only 4.4% in the EU, meaning that real wages have dropped by 2.4% in Europe; in Italy, real wages are now 12% below what they were in 2008. This is a global trend: The International Labour Organization (ILO) reported that real wages fell (by 0.9%) in 2022 for the first time in this century. What's more, inequalities are set to rise as the most precarious members of society spend a larger share of their incomes on essential goods and services such as energy, food and mobility – the prices of which have risen even faster than other components of household budgets.The decline of trade unions, globalization and the threat of offshoring, the development of insecure employment (including on work platforms) all help to explain why, everywhere, labor's share as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has been declining since the 1980s. In OECD countries, for example, it fell from 66.1% to 61.7% between 1990 and 2009.At the same time, there is a growing feeling that wages do not reflect the true value of the work provided. Beyond the extreme case of people offering their time for free within the household or the community (most of them women), there is a general feeling of unease: The most socially useful professions falling in the category of ""care"" work or the maintenance of the commons, are the least valued.In a study of the jobs that became ""essential"" during the Covid-19 pandemic, the ILO found that ""essential workers"" (most often female workers) earned, on average, 26% less than others and that at least a third of this gap cannot be explained by differences in qualifications. In other words, workers who provide vital services to society in sectors such as food production and retailing, healthcare, cleaning and sanitation, and transport are being underpaid.This should hardly come as a surprise: While labor's true contribution to general well-being cannot be limited to monetary value added, workers' bargaining power mainly depends on the price paid by the end consumer of the good or service. Yet those benefiting from the services provided by care workers are unwilling or unable to pay more. This is yet another reason for the current malaise: Because of how the value of work is currently determined in the labor market, its compensation is worse when responding to the needs of low-income earners rather than the demand expressed by wealthier households.",/en/global-issues/
US to resume deportation flights to Venezuela,"    The Biden administration is set to recommence deportations of Venezuelan migrants, the largest group encountered at the US-Mexico border last month, as their numbers continue to increase amidst economic challenges in their home country. ","The United States said on Thursday, October 5, it will resume deportation flights to Venezuela after a deal with Caracas, as President Joe Biden, seeking reelection, comes under pressure to halt border crossings. Washington has for years halted sending migrants back to Venezuela due to instability in the South American nation and still maintains sanctions against the government of President Nicolas Maduro. But Venezuela, one of the main countries of origin for surging numbers of migrants crossing the southern US border from Mexico, agreed to take back its nationals, the US said.""Today the United States is announcing the resumption of removal flights to Venezuela,"" a senior Biden administration official said. ""This comes following a decision from the authorities of Venezuela to accept back their nationals."" The first flights will resume ""in the next few days"". They will affect Venezuelan migrants who have arrived in the United States illegally since July 31. ""We have already identified individuals in our custody today, who will be removed promptly in the coming days,"" the official said.Venezuela confirmed the deal but blamed US sanctions for the flow of migrants. ""The Venezuelan migration in recent years is the direct consequence of the unilateral coercive measures and the blockade of our economy... by the United States,"" the government said in a statement.The announcement comes on the same day as the Biden administration said it was extending the US border wall with Mexico, with Biden under pressure from Republicans to curb migration. More than 100,000 Venezuelans have been intercepted by US border patrol after crossing the southern US frontier from Mexico between May and the end of August, a source told AFP.The United States meanwhile denied that it was overlooking rights concerns in Venezuela to push through the deal. ""This decision is consistent with the administration's efforts to implement a strategy of humane, safe, and orderly enforcement of our immigration laws,"" the State Department statement said.Venezuela's Maduro, the heir to firebrand leftist Hugo Chavez, last won an election in 2018 in a vote widely criticized internationally for alleged irregularities. The United States declared Maduro to be illegitimate and recognized then opposition leader Juan Guaido, imposing sweeping sanctions on Venezuela including its key money-making oil sector. But Guaido failed to take control and the opposition removed him late last year.In signs of a possible thaw, the Biden administration last year approved an oil project in Venezuela by Chevron and has voiced a willingness to ease sanctions further in return for progress.",/en/global-issues/
2023 Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi honored for fight against oppression of Iranian women,"    The 51-year-old activist and journalist, who sacrificed everything to continue her struggle in Iran, is rewarded 'her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.' ","Just over a year after the death in police custody of young Mahsa Amini, which precipitated a violently repressed popular uprising in Iran, on Friday, October 6, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi, currently imprisoned in the Islamic Republic.The 51-year-old activist and journalist is being honored ""for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her struggle to promote human rights and freedom for all,"" said the president of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, in Oslo, as she called on Tehran to secure her release.Despite repression and multiple prison stays, Mohammadi, Iran's most famous human rights campaigner, has chosen to continue her fight in Iran, sacrificing even her family life. When her husband, Taghi Rahmani, an activist like herself, decided to leave Iran in 2012 after years of imprisonment, the Iranian woman didn't want to follow in his footsteps. Their twin children, Ali and Kiana, remained in Iran until 2015, before joining their father in Paris. ""Like the mother of Moses, I entrusted my two children to the River Nile,"" she described her heartbreak at the time, in a letter, written from the infamous Evin prison north of Tehran where she was serving a six-year sentence.At the time, her twins were just 8 years old. Since then, Mohammadi has seen neither her children nor her husband. Her life has been punctuated by arrests, threats and constant pressure from the Iranian secret services.The news of her Nobel Peace Prize sparked a wave of joy in Iran. ""I'm happy that Narges, as an Iranian woman and human rights activist, has won this award,"" said a political activist from Tehran, who has known the laureate for over two decades and prefers to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""She focused on human rights and hardly hesitated to pay the heaviest price, i.e. being away from her husband and children. For this, she received a lot of criticism, but she felt that her duty to Iranian society was more important.""Another political activist living in Tehran, who has known Mohammadi for 23 years, said, ""The most visible trait of her character is her audacity. If she considers a cause just, she fights for it to the end.""Mohammadi, now 52, was for years the spokesperson for the Iranian Human Rights Association, founded by the other 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner, lawyer Shirin Ebadi. She was also a signatory of the ""Campaign for the Gradual Abolition of the Death Penalty"" petition, for which she was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2015. Her multiple and prolonged stays in detention caused her neurological disorders resulting in muscular paralysis. In 2020, she was released after more than five years in prison.",/en/global-issues/
Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Iranian women's rights campaigner Narges Mohammadi,    The imprisoned Iranian activist was named as the recipient of the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday 'for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.' ,"Imprisoned Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, October 6, in recognition of her tireless campaigning for women's rights and democracy and against the death penalty.Mohammadi, 51, has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and spending years behind bars.""This prize is first and foremost a recognition of the very important work of a whole movement in Iran with its undisputed leader, Nargis Mohammadi,"" said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who announced the prize in Oslo.She said the committee hopes the prize ""is an encouragement to continue the work in whichever form this movement finds to be fitting."" She also urged Iran to release Mohammadi in time for the prize ceremony on December 10.For nearly all of Mohammadi's life, Iran has been governed by a Shiite theocracy headed by the country's supreme leader. While women hold jobs, academic positions and even government appointments, their lives can be tightly controlled. Laws require all women to at least wear a headscarf, or hijab, to cover their hair as a sign of piety. Iran and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only countries that mandate it.In a statement to the New York Times, Mohammadi said the ""global support and recognition of my human rights advocacy makes me more resolved, more responsible, more passionate and more hopeful. I also hope this recognition makes Iranians protesting for change stronger and more organized. Victory is near.""Mohammadi has been imprisoned 13 times and convicted five times, according to Reiss-Andersen. In total, she has been sentenced to 31 years in prison. Mohammadi's most recent incarceration began when she was detained in 2021 after she attended a memorial for a person killed in nationwide protests sparked by an increase in gasoline prices. She has been held at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison, whose inmates include those with Western ties and political prisoners.""The women of Iran have been an inspiration for the world. Their courage and determination in the face of reprisals, intimidation, violence and detention have been remarkable,"" said Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the UN human rights office in Geneva. ""We call for her release and the release of all other human rights defenders detained in Iran.""Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman, after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi won the award in 2003. It's the fifth time in the 122-year history of the awards that the Peace Prize has been given to someone who is in prison or under house arrest. Last year, the top human rights advocate in Belarus, Ales Bialiatski, was among the winners. He remains imprisoned.Mohammadi was behind bars for the recent protests over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. That sparked one of the most intense challenges ever to Iran's theocracy. More than 500 people were killed in a heavy security crackdown while over 22,000 others were arrested.From behind bars, she contributed an opinion piece for the New York Times. ""What the government may not understand is that the more of us they lock up, the stronger we become,"" she wrote.In a first reaction from Tehran, the semi-official Fars news agency dismissed Mohammadi as someone who ""persisted in creating tension and unrest and falsely claimed that she was beaten in prison."" Fars is believed to be close to Iran's hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which answers only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Abuse in Iranian prisons – something Mohammadi has campaigned against both outside of and behind bars – has been widely reported by the UN and human rights groups. Before being jailed, Mohammadi was vice president of the banned Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran. Ebadi, who Mohammadi is close to, founded the center.In 2018, Mohammadi, an engineer, was awarded the Andrei Sakharov Prize. Earlier this year, PEN America, which advocates for freedom of speech, gave Mohammadi its PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award. The organization applauded her win.The choice ""is a tribute to her courage and that of countless women and girls who have poured out into the streets of Iran and faced down one of the world's most brutal and stubborn regimes, risking their lives to demand their rights,"" PEN America CEO Suzanne Nossel said in a statement.The Nobel Prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1 million). Winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma at the award ceremonies in December.In addition to Bialiatski, human rights activists from Ukraine and Russia also shared last year's prize, in what was seen as a strong rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine.Other previous winners include Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama, Mikhail Gorbachev, Aung San Suu Kyi and the United Nations.",/en/global-issues/
All aboard! Five waterfront restaurants in the Paris region,Selection,"Even if autumn is upon us, lunch or dinner by the water is not out of the question. Around Paris, a host of restaurants and guinguettes offer the chance to drop anchor and try their often iodized menus. Except that in most of these places, the quality is rarely up to scratch. And a host of ""concept"" restaurants rely more on the marketing tricks of old Seadogs than on their menus. Here is a selection of fine establishments where you can dock without worry.Some restaurants on the banks of the Seine have a slightly old-fashioned charm that stirs up both nostalgia and appetite. You'll sit beside ancient barges, lost in the silky reflections of the water or the promise of a menu featuring rump steak and sea bass that seems not to have changed in ages (except for the prices). L'Imprévu, in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine (Yvelines, west of Paris), belongs to this category of seemingly unchanging good restaurants. Nevertheless, there have been many changes: Julien Praillet, the chef and owner, modernized everything when he took over from his father seven years ago, getting rid of the carpet and Louis XVI decor. What remains today is a bright, uncluttered dining room, its walls adorned in beautiful golden stone, and a small terrace jutting out toward the river on fine days.The short menu pays tribute to classics and homemade dishes. From the foie gras to the profiteroles, everything is prepared on-site. Even the salmon (Scottish red label) is smoked in the kitchen. Some dishes are, admittedly, subtly reinvented with a sweet-and-savory twist. For the appetizer, a delicious veal liver arrives pink, almost caramelized, on a handful of strawberries bursting with flavor. Duck breast comes with a sweet potato mousseline. However, on the whole, we were not particularly overwhelmed, including by the dressings: Here and there, streaks of balsamic vinegar criss-cross the plate, a practice that was fashionable a decade or so ago. However, that's not the point; you're sure to leave the place happy and warmed by well-crafted values served with a smile by friendly staff. There's a three-course set menu at €39 and the owner is considering a lunchtime set menu. Let them know if you'd like vegetarian options; they are not listed on the menu but can be arranged.A cluster of pleasure boats floats in the green waters of the port. Onlookers in pastel shorts seem to stroll in slow motion along the quays. This could be a seaside resort, but in fact, we're in the Val-d'Oise, at Port de Cergy (northwest of Paris). Opposite the sailboats, a small restaurant focusing on fresh produce stands out from the competition: Le Millésime du Port. Young chef Pierre-Jean Delmas (formerly of Biarritz's Hôtel du Palais) took over the helm of this gourmet bistro boat seven years ago and steers a firm course to anchor his establishment in seasonal and local produce (as far as possible).",/en/lifestyle/
18 migrants killed in Mexico bus crash,"    The dead, three of them minors, were from Venezuela and Haiti, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office in Oaxaca state. ","A bus carrying migrants overturned in southern Mexico on Friday, October 6, leaving at least 18 passengers dead and 27 injured, authorities said – the latest fatal road crash involving US-bound migrants.The dead, three of them minors, were from Venezuela and Haiti, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office in Oaxaca state. The accident happened at around dawn on a highway linking Oaxaca and the neighboring state of Puebla, it said. The injured were taken to hospital for treatment, it added.Images released by state authorities showed the wreckage of the bus lying on its side on a highway winding through hills.Thousands of migrants from different countries have been traveling across Mexico in buses, overcrowded trailers and atop freight trains in an attempt to reach the US-Mexican border. More than 8,200 migrants have died or disappeared in the Americas since 2014, most of them while trying to reach the United States via Mexico, according to the International Organization for Migration.On Sunday, at least 10 Cuban migrants were killed and 25 injured when a cargo truck carrying them overturned in the southern state of Chiapas. In early August, at least 18 people died and 23 were injured after a bus carrying local passengers and migrants from countries such as India, the Dominican Republic and some African nations plunged into a ravine in the state of Nayarit.On Thursday, senior US and Mexican officials pledged to redouble their efforts to tackle irregular migration through measures such as modernizing border security, increasing legal avenues and addressing the root causes.The two countries were committed to expanding ""safe, orderly and lawful pathways for migrants"" but with ""strict consequences"" for those who enter the United States illegally, US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said after the talks in Mexico City.",/en/global-issues/
"Iran media slam Mohammadi Nobel Peace Prize win, Biden calls for her release",    US President Joe Biden hailed Narges Mohammadi's 'unshakable courage' after being honored with the Nobel Peace Prize. She has been incarcerated since November 2021. ,"Media in Iran on Friday, October 6, lambasted jailed rights campaigner Narges Mohammadi who won the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize, saying she had ""collaborated with terrorist groups"" and committed ""anti-Iranian activities.""Foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani called the move to award Mohammadi the Peace Prize ""biased and political."" Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden called on Iran to free Mohammadi, hailing her ""unshakable courage"" after she won the Nobel Peace Prize. ""This award is a recognition that... the world still hears the clarion voice of Narges Mohammadi calling for freedom and equality,"" Biden said in a statement. ""I urge the government in Iran to immediately release her and her fellow gender equality advocates from captivity.""The 51-year-old journalist and activist has spent much of the past two decades on multiple charges, including spreading anti-state propaganda and committing acts against national security. Most recently, she has been incarcerated since November 2021.Mohammadi had expressed support for the protest movement that rocked Iran following the September 16, 2022, death in police custody of Mahsa Amini. Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women. Her death triggered months-long demonstrations which the authorities in Iran labeled as ""riots"" fomented by foreign governments.Iranian media also lashed out at both her and the award. The official IRNA news agency criticized the Nobel Committee for awarding ""a woman who collaborated with terrorist groups"" and who is ""unknown in her own country, particularly among Iranian women."" It said awarding Mohammadi the Peace Prize was an ""interventionist act"" meant to ""politicize the concept of human rights.""Tasnim news agency called her a ""security convict"" who committed ""subversive"" activities, and said the Nobel Peace Prize had a history of being handed to ""criminals.""

Over 500 migrants arrive on Spain's Canary Islands,    They have come over the past 24 hours in six large wooden boats after traversing the perilous Atlantic route from West Africa. ,"Over 500 migrants reached Spain's Canary Islands in six large wooden boats over the past 24 hours after traversing the perilous Atlantic route from West Africa, the country's maritime rescue service said on Friday, October 6.Their arrival came as European Union leaders met in Granada in southern Spain, with the thorny issue of migration in focus due to the recent surge in arrivals on the Italian island of Lampedusa. Three boats carrying a total of 275 people arrived at El Hierro, the smallest and most westerly of the Canary Islands, a spokeswoman for Spain's maritime rescue service said. Another two boats arrived in Tenerife and one boat arrived on Gran Canaria with a total of 243 people, bringing the total number of migrants who reached the archipelago on the six boats to 518, she added.The Canaries have experienced a surge in migrant arrivals in recent days as smugglers take advantage of calm weather to try to ferry people to the archipelago, located in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of Africa. At their nearest point, the islands are 100 kilometers from Morocco.A boat carrying 280 migrants landed on El Hierro on Tuesday, the largest number to arrive in the archipelago in a single vessel. Over 1,200 migrants have arrived over the past week on the tiny island, which is home to 11,000 people, overwhelming its social services, officials said.Juan Miguel Padron, the mayor of El Pinar near the port that has received the migrant boats, told Spanish public television ""all the nurses and doctors"" in the town had been pulled away to deal with the influx. Spanish authorities transferred some 500 migrants from El Hierro to Tenerife overnight on Thursday.In recent years, the migratory route to the Canary Islands has been particularly busy due to tighter controls in the Mediterranean Sea. Shipwrecks are frequent, as the crossing is particularly dangerous.The Canaries saw 14,976 migrants arrive between January 1 and September 30, an increase of 19.8% compared to the same period in 2022, according to the latest figures from Spain's Interior Ministry.",/en/global-issues/
Japan seeks to strip Unification Church of official recognition,"    The Japanese government first ordered a probe into the Moon sect last year, following the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe. ","The Japanese government said on Thursday, October 12, it was seeking to strip official recognition from the Unification Church, the influential sect under intense scrutiny since the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida last year ordered a probe into the church after it emerged that Abe's alleged killer was motivated by resentment against the group. It has been accused of pressuring its followers into making hefty donations and blamed for child neglect among its members.If granted, the court dissolution order sought by the government would see the church lose its status as a tax-exempt organization but still be allowed to continue its religious practices.""In view of the extensive damage caused, we find that it falls under the grounds for ordering dissolution as stated in the religious corporations law,"" Education Minister Masahito Moriyama told reporters after a panel of experts unanimously agreed with the decision. The church ""forced a number of people to contribute donations and buy items (...) in a way that restricted their free decision-making and sabotaged their sound judgment,"" he added.The minister said the request would be filed to the Tokyo District Court as early as Friday, once ""preparations are complete.""Abe was gunned down in broad daylight last year while giving a campaign speech in the western Nara region. The suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, is said to have resented the sect over large donations his mother made that bankrupted his family. He could face the death penalty if convicted.Investigations after Abe's death revealed close ties between the church and many conservative ruling lawmakers in Japan. Four of Kishida's ministers have since stepped down over allegations of financial irregularities or links to the church.Abe, Japan's longest-serving leader, was not a member of the church but had addressed an affiliated group, as have other well-known speakers including Donald Trump. The former prime minister died on July 8, 2022, after being shot with a homemade gun as he spoke to supporters near a train station in Nara.Yamagami, who faces murder and weapons charges, was apprehended on the spot. He reportedly targeted Abe over his ties to the sect, of which Yamagami's mother was a follower.The suspect's uncle told local media his nephew sometimes called him for help when his mother left her children alone and without food while attending church. She donated 100 million yen (then around $1 million) to the group before declaring bankruptcy, he added.The church has confirmed his mother's membership but refused to reveal how much she donated over the years.Known officially as the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, the sect has denied wrongdoing and pledged to prevent ""excessive"" donations from members.Founded in South Korea in 1954 by Sun Myung Moon, the church, whose members are colloquially known as ""Moonies,"" rose to global prominence in the 1970s and '80s. Japan has since become a key financial hub for the church, which teaches Japanese believers they need to atone for their country's wartime occupation of Korea.",/en/global-issues/
"Narges Mohammadi, the Nobel Peace Prize for courage",    The imprisoned Iranian activist was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for women's rights. ,"Just over a year after the young Mahsa Amini died in police custody, precipitating a violently repressed popular uprising in Iran, on Friday, October 6, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi, currently imprisoned in the jails of the Islamic Republic.The 51-year-old journalist is being rewarded "" for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all,"" said the president of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, in Oslo, as she called on Tehran to release Mohammadi from prison.A tireless Iranian human rights defender, Mohammadi sacrificed everything to continue her fight in Iran. When her husband and activist Taghi Rahmani decided to leave the country in 2012 after years of imprisonment, she decided not to follow in his footsteps. Their twin children, Ali and Kiana, remained in Iran until 2015 before joining their father in Paris. ""Like the mother of Moses, I entrusted my two children to the River Nile,"" she wrote at the time in a letter from the infamous Evin prison, north of Tehran, where she was serving a six-year prison sentence. Her twins were only eight years old at the time. Since then, Mohammadi has seen neither her children nor her husband. Her life has been marked by arrests, threats, and constant pressure from the Iranian secret services.For many years, Mohammadi was the spokesperson for the Iranian organization Defenders of Human Rights Center, founded in 2003 by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and lawyer Shirin Ebadi. Bringing together leading Iranian lawyers such as Nasrin Sotoudeh (winner of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Human Rights in 2012), the group's mission was to support and defend political prisoners and their families, in addition to raising Iranian society's awareness about its rights.Mohammadi was arrested for the first time in 2010, a year after the ultraconservative former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-2013) was fraudulently re-elected. She was sentenced to six years in prison for her activities within this organization. In 2012, the journalist was released after being deemed unable to endure detention due to physical and neurological problems. She immediately took up the fight again. In 2013, she signed the ""Campaign for Step by Step Abolition of the Death Penalty"" petition, which led to her re-arrest a year later and a 10-year prison sentence. She claims to have been mistreated and abused by her prison guards on several occasions. Her multiple and lengthy stays in prison caused neurological disorders that resulted in muscular paralysis.",/en/global-issues/
Refugee camps on Greek islands are once again overcrowded,"    For the first time in three years, the camps on the Greek islands near Turkey are once again full – and unsanitary. In just three months, some 17,500 migrants have arrived in Greece via the Aegean Sea. ","Two years after its inauguration with great fanfare, the enclosed camp of Zervou, on the island of Samos, which faces the Turkish coast, is no longer brand-new nor empty. The high-security site is, for the first time, overcrowded, bringing to mind the unsanitary conditions of the previous camp that overlooked the town of Vathy, where, at the peak of the 2015-2016 migration crisis, up to 10,000 refugees were crammed into makeshift shacks among garbage and rats.Journalists, who were invited to the opening to see the improvement in conditions (modern containers with Wi-Fi and air conditioning), have now been banned from entering, which Reporters Without Borders denounced on Wednesday, October 4 as a ""serious infringement of the right to information."" The Zervou compound, which is surrounded by barbed wire, currently accommodates over 4,000 migrants, although its initial stated capacity was 2,040.According to the Ministry of Migration, around 17,500 asylum seekers arrived on the Greek islands near Turkey between July and September, compared with some 17,000 over the whole of 2022. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the number of arrivals on the Greek islands between January and July increased by 136% compared to the same period in 2022. While the migration minister is trying to reassure the Greek public, pointing out that the 30,000 migrants who have arrived since the start of the year are nothing like the 800,000 or so who landed in 2015, concerns about camp conditions are resurfacing.Owen Breuil, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Samos, said, ""The water supply is inadequate. Refugees often can't shower or wash their clothes, which causes health problems. We have observed several cases of scabies, gastroenteritis and urinary tract infections, which are linked to this lack of hygiene.""In early September, a doctor was finally assigned to the camp. ""But for 4,000 people – and, furthermore, vulnerable populations, who suffer from high blood pressure, heart problems and post-traumatic stress – this is obviously not enough,"" said Breuil. Doctors Without Borders has therefore decided to organize a team of two doctors, two nurses, two psychologists and a midwife to visit the camp four times a week.The lack of trash collectors is also starting to be flagrant. ""There is no first-aid station if a refugee falls ill, and all the structures that were proudly inaugurated at the start, such as communal kitchens and classrooms, are not working. They are now being used to accommodate the surplus of people. There are now only very few NGOs authorized to operate in the camp,"" said Marc-Antoine Pineau, the Greece coordinator for On The Road. The NGO has a shelter outside the camp, ""La Maison,"" to welcome those in need of psychological support.",/en/global-issues/
Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to Claudia Goldin for research on women’s labor market outcomes,    The Harvard professor is only the third woman to ever win the economics prize. ,"The Nobel Economics Prize was awarded on Monday, October 9, to Claudia Goldin, a professor at Harvard University, for research that has advanced the understanding of the gender gap in the labor market.The announcement went a tiny step to closing the Nobel committee’s own gender gap: Goldin is just the third woman to win the prize out of 93 economics laureates.She has studied 200 years of women's participation in the workplace, showing that despite continued economic growth, women's pay did not continuously catch up to men's and a divide still exists despite women gaining higher levels of education than men.""Understanding women’s role in the labor market is important for society. Thanks to Claudia Goldin’s groundbreaking research, we now know much more about the underlying factors and which barriers may need to be addressed in the future,"" said Jakob Svensson, chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences.Goldin does not offer solutions, but her research allows policymakers to tackle the entrenched problem, said Randi Hjalmarsson, a member of the prize committee.""She explains the source of the gap, and how it’s changed over time and how it varies with the stage of development. And therefore, there is no single policy,"" Hjalmarsson said. ""So it’s a complicated policy question because if you don’t know the underlying reason, a certain policy won’t work.""However, ""by finally understanding the problem and calling it by the right name, we will be able to pave a better route forward,"" Hjalmarsson said.Goldin had to become a data sleuth as she sought to fill in missing data for her research, Hjalmarsson said. For parts of history, systematic labor market records did not exist, and, if they did, information about women was missing.""So how did Claudia Goldin overcome this missing data challenge? She had to be a detective to dig through the archives to find novel data sources and creative ways to use them to measure these unknowns,"" Hjalmarsson said. Of receiving the award, Goldin, 77, ""was surprised and very, very glad,"" Ellegren said.It follows the awards in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace that were announced last week.The economics award was created in 1968 by Sweden's central bank and is formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.Last year's winners were former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, Douglas W. Diamond and Philip Dybvig for their research into bank failures that helped shape America’s aggressive response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis.",/en/global-issues/
Noble Peace Prize Winner Narges Mohammadi: The voice of Iranian protest,"Beyond the journalist and activist for women's rights and human rights, currently imprisoned in Iran, this distinction from the Norwegian committee is aimed at a vast protest movement triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini, just over a year ago.","The Iranian regime may well denounce a ""biased and political"" decision, and wave the conspiracy flag of a maneuver involving ""some European governments,"" but the reality is nevertheless damning: The infamous Evin prison in Tehran is now home to a Nobel Peace Prize winner. By honoring a prisoner, Narges Mohammadi, an activist for women's rights and human rights, with this prestigious distinction on Friday, October 6, the Norwegian committee paid tribute to her courage and determination.We can only applaud this choice and call on the Iranian authorities, as did many leaders around the world after this announcement, to restore her freedom. In addition to the journalist who is frequently arbitrarily arrested, and who is currently paying a new penalty for her tireless struggle against the excesses of the current regime in Teheran, this Nobel Peace Prize is aimed at a vast protest movement triggered by the brutal death of Mahsa Amini, just over a year ago. The young woman died at the hands of the morality police for wearing a headscarf in a manner deemed reprehensible.The award is also a symbolic response to the ruthless repression of this protest, which is embodied in the slogan ""Woman, Life, Freedom."" The triptych refers to the impasses that form a dark part of the legacy of this military-religious regime. Women are still considered second-class citizens. Aggravated by international sanctions due to the nuclear arms race, the economic crisis fueled by corruption and incompetence darkens future prospects. Freedom is being attacked on all fronts by the state and its militias.In a letter written in June behind the walls of Evin prison and published in Le Monde on the eve of the first anniversary of Amini's death, Mohammadi made the same observation. ""If you look closely at Iranian society, you will see that every individual is guilty of a desire to live at every moment of his life and in every place"" in the eyes of the regime, she wrote, convinced nonetheless that Iranians' fight for their freedoms will not die out.The activist knows her country too well not to know that this fight will be a long one. When Shirin Ebadi, the founding lawyer of the Defenders of Human Rights Center (for whom Mohammadi has long been a spokesperson), was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, while she was traveling abroad, thousands of Iranians celebrated her return. Any remaining hope of opening up the regime was swept away by waves of repression, and Ebadi resigned herself to exile six years later. Since then, the situation has only worsened.Sadly, there is likely to be an empty chair at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. In her, Narges Mohammadi issued an invitation to her readers: ""Be our voice, too, relay our message of hope, tell the world we are not behind these walls for nothing, and that we are now stronger than our tormentors who use every possible means to silence our society."" That voice rang out on October 6, louder than ever.",/en/global-issues/
UN warns of 'devastating human consequences' of Israel's evacuation order,"    A UN special rapporteur said that forcible population transfers are a 'crime against humanity.' The UN urged Israel to rescind the order, saying, 'Even wars have rules.' ","The UN expert on displacement said Friday she was ""horrified"" by Israel telling 1.1 million residents to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip, condemning the order as a crime against humanity.Paula Gaviria Betancur, the United Nations' special rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, said it was inconceivable that Gazans could move across a war zone without devastating consequences.Thousands of Palestinians fled to southern Gaza in search of refuge on Friday after Israel warned them to evacuate before an expected ground offensive against Hamas in retaliation for the deadliest attack in Israel's history.""Forcible population transfers constitute a crime against humanity, and collective punishment is prohibited under international humanitarian law,"" Gaviria Betancur said in a statement. ""We are horrified at the prospect of an additional one million Palestinians joining the over 423,000 people already forcibly driven from their homes by the violence over the past week.""""It is inconceivable that more than half of Gaza's population could traverse an active war zone, without devastating humanitarian consequences, particularly while deprived of essential supplies and basic services.""UN special rapporteurs are unpaid, independent figures mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not speak for the UN but report their findings to it. Gaviria Betancur urged Israel to rescind the evacuation order immediately, saying those currently displaced had nowhere to go.Meanwhile, the UN has also condemned Israel's order. UN chief Antonio Guterres appealed Friday for the protection of basic human rights as the Israel-Hamas conflict spiraled, stressing that ""even wars have rules"" and warning against using hostages as human shields.""The situation in Gaza has reached a dangerous new low,"" Guterres said ahead of a Security Council meeting on the volatile situation.""We need immediate humanitarian access throughout Gaza, so that we can get fuel, food and water to everyone in need,"" he said, adding that the blockaded enclave's health system was on the brink of collapse.His call for the protection of civilians came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country's fierce bombardment of Gaza was ""just the beginning.""",/en/global-issues/
'The dangerous political instrumentalization of the Israel-Palestine conflict in France was reactivated by the Hamas attack',"As France's list of terrorist attacks gets longer and conflict in the Middle East fills political discourse, it's important to remember the equality movement that swept France in the 1980s.","It was 40 years ago and it was a different world. The children of immigrants, who called themselves ""beurs"" (a colloquial French term for people whose parents or grandparents come from North Africa), dreamed of finding their place in a France that despised their parents and made them invisible, workers convinced that one day they would return ""to the homeland."" At the Elysée Palace, former socialist president François Mitterrand promised to change people's lives, while at the municipal elections, Jean-Marie Le Pen, father of Marine Le Pen and leader of the French far-right, emerged from electoral purgatory when his party's candidate was elected mayor of Dreux in western France. The Algerian war was not so far away, and trigger-happy nostalgics were targeting Arabs. In social housing estates, immigrant workers lived side-by-side with doctors, teachers and French workers for the first time; left-wing municipalities, with their volunteers and union activists, created a tight social fabric.On October 15, 1983, just four decades ago, a handful of young people decided to set off from Marseille, amidst general indifference, for a March for Equality and Against Racism. At the time – although it's tempting to idealize the era – violence, impunity and discrimination were widespread, mostly going ignored by politicians and the media. That generation of sons and daughters of immigrants, the vast majority Algerian, had quite simply decided to stop kowtowing to society's expectations like their parents had done, and demand their rights as French citizens.What sparked it (as has been the case so many times since then) was an incident with the police. Toumi Djaïdja, a son of a Harki (Harkis are Muslim Algerians who fought on the side of France during the Algerian war of independence) from the Minguettes housing estate in Vénissieux, near Lyon, was accused of driving into France's riot police after trying to escape a police roadside check. Legend has it that, on his hospital bed, after being injured by police in another altercation, he took up the idea of a march inspired by Martin Luther King's ""I have a dream"" march ""for jobs and freedom"" in Washington in 1963.It was the priest Christian Delorme and the pastor Jean Costil who strove for a dream of equality attained without violence. The march arrived in Paris on December 3, 1983, and 100,000 people with a shared ideal burst into the streets, leading to the then-president François Mitterrand receiving a delegation of marchers at the Elysée Palace.",/en/global-issues/
Morocco's earthquake survivors face the fear of sex crimes,"    In the High Atlas, communities and local associations are trying to protect the most vulnerable victims of the natural disaster from child predators, kidnappers and forced marriages. ","The little girl looked barely 10 years old. The man in his 40s, who called himself a ""volunteer"" in the earthquake-hit villages, posted an image on Instagram and wrote: ""She doesn't want to come with me to Casablanca. But she promised we'd get married when she's older."" In a matter of days, the story spread like wildfire in the High Atlas region that was hit hard on the night of September 8-9, reigniting a deep-seated fear of kidnappings and forced marriages.In the days that followed, another man was arrested after boasting that he would travel to the disaster areas to commit sex crimes. On social media, other messages posted by members of wealthy urban communities offered survivors the chance to come and act as their servants, ""as they have lost everything."" The offer is not insignificant: In Morocco, many domestic workers are underpaid, deprived of rights and sometimes abused or raped.In these poor, remote villages, women and children sometimes find themselves on the side of the road, exposed to the incessant passing of construction trucks, NGOs or spontaneous volunteers. And it's not easy to tell the difference between a good Samaritan and a malicious one. In the field, aid workers prefer not to talk too much about kidnapping.It has to be said that much of the awareness-raising work has been done on the internet, via numerous influencers. ""We've received around 10 reports of this kind of behavior,"" said Ghizlane Mamouni, lawyer and president of the Kif Mama Kif Baba association, which is at the forefront of the defense of children's and women's rights in the country. ""We have systematically lodged complaints."" Her association has also brought together 21 other local players to set up a special telephone hotline to report cases of violence.The associations have also published a manifesto summarizing what to do. In the aftermath of the earthquake, women face a ""risk of gender-based violence, including sexual harassment and assault"" and ""may be afraid to access essential services for safety reasons."" Lalla Hakima Drissi, from the NGO Global Diversity Foundation, confirmed this: ""One of the most urgent needs is toilets. At the moment, it's very difficult to access them, so many women wait until nightfall, to get away from the camp and out of sight of the men."" But they are all the more vulnerable in this situation because they find themselves alone.Many local initiatives, often spontaneous, have sprung up. In Ouirgane, after an hour and a half of winding roads from Marrakech, you have to show your credentials to enter the ramshackle camp set up in the alleys of what used to be a field of peach and olive trees. Sitting in front of the ""kitchen"" – a large tent in which worktops have been made from planks found in the rubble – Toufik Saidi, 42, said: ""We check in and out so as not to let anyone unknown into the camp.""",/en/global-issues/
The central part played by women in the 1983 March for Equality in France,News,"""Tomorrow I'm leaving."" Malika Boumediene still cannot believe she uttered this sentence to her mother one day in October 1983. At the age of 20, the shy young woman, who had never left the comforts of her family, suddenly announced that she wanted to leave their home in the rural department of Ardèche in southeast France. She wanted to join a collective march against racism that was passing through Saint-Vallier, on the other side of the Rhône River. Her mother was determined to dissuade her. ""She was really against it. She was scared for me. But I packed my little bag and left the next day,"" recalled the 60-year-old care assistant, still amazed at her audacity.In her living room on the second floor of a building overlooking a roundabout near Annonay in Ardèche, exhausted after a night on call, the mother of three revisited her past, leafing through a photo album. She conjured up her youthful face, her slightly sulky pout and the abundant curly hair that flashed above the banner of the small group on the road: ""March for Equality and Against Racism.""Born to Algerian parents who came to France after the end of the Second World War, Boumedienne was part of the original organizers behind the 1983 march. ""My mother was angry and wouldn't answer the phone when I called. But when the TV started talking about us, she began to accept it,"" she said. From around 20 participants at the outset, on October 15 in Marseille in southern France, they went to 100,000 at the finish line, on Saturday, December 3, at Place de la Bastille in central Paris. It was a communion of rare intensity. In the same year that Richard Attenborough's film celebrated Gandhi on cinema screens, these anonymous figures completed a peaceful march filled with hope, to denounce racist crimes, incessant police control and the feeling of rejection that weighed on second-generation North African immigrants. Among them, young women played a decisive, but little-known, role.Forty years on, Boumedienne takes no credit for her initiative, neither for the 1,500 kilometers she walked, nor for her presence in the small delegation received by former president François Mitterrand at the Elysée Palace. ""When we were on the podium, at the end of [Junior Minister in charge of immigrant workers] Georgina Dufoix's speech, we learned that eight persons had been designated to meet the president. I was chosen. He spent five minutes talking to each of us. He wanted to know how we lived in our towns. He did the rounds with everyone and that was it,"" she said, unimpressed by the meeting.",/en/global-issues/
France's Sénat starts debating contested immigration bill,    The government's text needs the support of conservative MPs to get through both houses of Parliament. ,"France's Sénat starts on Monday, November 6, to debate a hugely controversial immigration bill that the government says will bolster security for documented migrants but that opponents see as new evidence of a lurch to the right by President Emmanuel Macron.Left-wingers reject the bill's bid to expel more people and toughen conditions for undocumented migrants, while conservatives' hackles have been raised by provisions to regularise the situation of undocumented workers in sectors with labor shortages. It is the right flank that poses the biggest obstacle to Macron and his minority centrist government passing the legislation. Conservative MPs' votes will be needed to get the bill through the lower house of parliament, the Assemblée Nationale, while the right has a majority in the upper house, the Sénat.""This text is about firmness,"" Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said on Sunday, drawing on language meant to appeal to the conservative Les Républicains (LR) party. He vowed to ""find a way to get (the bill) through parliament"". But several attempts to get LR on board over the past year have fallen flat and there is little sign that this time will be different.""We can't have a bill that wants both to expel more people and regularise more people,"" Bruno Retailleau, the leader of the Sénat conservatives, told Agence France-Presse. He said any easing up of immigration law would be a ""sign of weakness"".Macron proposed broadening constitutional rules governing the type of social issues like immigration that can be put to referendum. The bone thrown towards the right has so far had little visible effect on rhetoric around the immigration bill.Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne on Monday rebuffed claims that regularising undocumented workers would create a ""pull effect"" and increase migration. Regularisations would benefit ""people who've been on our territory for years, who are well integrated, who've been working for years"", she told France Inter radio. The bill aims ""to more quickly remove those who shouldn't be here and at the same time to better integrate those who should remain"", Borne said.She nevertheless revealed continuing divisions within government when she opposed removing state medical aid for undocumented people, calling it ""a question of public health"". Darmanin has said he plans to ""eliminate"" the aid, replacing it only with cover for emergencies – calling it a step towards ""a good compromise"" with LR.Such talk, along with plans for annual migration quotas set by parliament and restrictions on allowing people to rejoin their families already in France, has drawn opposition from aid groups and left-leaning politicians. A protest was planned on Monday outside the Sénat building located in Paris' Luxembourg gardens.Debate around immigration was stoked in France over the summer by mass arrivals in Italy and a visit by Pope Francis to the southern French port city Marseille, where he urged people to welcome migrants. Last month's killing of a teacher by a Russian migrant with apparent jihadist beliefs has further ramped up the pressure.Marine Le Pen's far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party sees opportunity in its pet theme dominating political debate ahead of next year's European elections and in the long climb to the 2027 presidential election, when Macron cannot run again due to term limits. The immigration bill was ""a botched job"", RN vice-president Sebastien Chenu told RTL radio on Sunday – while saying the party's 80 MPs could vote for it in the hope of ""small results"".",/en/global-issues/
Six-year-old Muslim boy killed in Illinois hate crime linked to Israel-Hamas war,"    US President Joe Biden called for Americans to 'reject Islamaphobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred,' after a boy and his mother were stabbed at home by their landlord, who reportedly shouted 'You Muslims must die.' ","US President Joe Biden condemned the killing of a six-year-old Muslim boy as a ""horrific act of hate"" on Sunday, October 15, after authorities charged the assailant with murder and hate crimes for an attack allegedly linked to the war between Israel and Hamas.The child was stabbed 26 times by his landlord on Saturday and later died at hospital, while his 32-year-old mother was also wounded but expected to survive, the Will County sheriff's office in Illinois said in a statement.""Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,"" the sheriff's office said, adding the killing took place about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Chicago.Biden, in a statement late Sunday, confirmed that the woman was the boy's mother and said their ""Palestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we all seek – a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace."" ""This horrific act of hate has no place in America, and stands against our fundamental values,"" added Biden, calling for Americans to ""come together and reject Islamaphobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred.""Authorities said the woman managed to call 911 as she fought off the landlord, named by the sheriff's office as 71-year-old Joseph Czuba. ""Deputies located two victims inside the residence in a bedroom. Both victims had multiple stab wounds to their chest, torso, and upper extremities,"" the sheriff's statement said. A serrated military-style knife with a seven-inch blade was pulled from the boy's abdomen during the autopsy, the statement said.When police arrived they found Czuba sitting on the ground near the driveway of the residence with a laceration on his forehead. He was taken to hospital for treatment before being charged with murder, attempted murder, and two counts of hate crimes.""He knocked on the door and attempted to choke her, and said, 'you Muslims' must die,"" Ahmed Rehab, head of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Chicago office, told reporters, citing text messages sent by the woman to the murdered boy's father from her hospital bed. The attack was ""our worst nightmare,"" CAIR said in a statement.Israel declared war on Hamas last Sunday, a day after waves of the militant group's fighters broke through the heavily fortified border and shot, stabbed and burned to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.

""The practice of separating families at the southwest border was shameful,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""This agreement will facilitate the reunification of separated families and provide them with critical services to aid in their recovery.""The settlement, which still needs the approval of a US District Court judge, will provide support services for separated families, the Justice Department said. The services include legal support for immigration claims, housing assistance and some medical coverage. It does not include any monetary damages. The proposed settlement also sets new standards intended to limit future separations of parents and children, the Justice Department said and bars the government from separating migrant families for the next eight years.""By providing services to these families and implementing policies to prevent future separations, today's agreement addresses the impacts of those separations and helps ensure that nothing like this happens again,"" Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said.Biden issued an executive order in February 2021, shortly after taking office, pledging to ""protect family unity and ensure that children entering the United States are not separated from their families."" An estimated 4,000 families were separated at the southern border in 2017 and 2018 under the Trump administration's so-called ""zero-tolerance policy.""Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the families in their class-action lawsuit, said the settlement ""closes the darkest chapter of the Trump administration."" ""To America's enduring shame, we tore children from the arms of their families to enact a xenophobic agenda,"" Romero said.Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the ACLU, said the settlement ""provides significant benefits to thousands of families, and an indispensable component bars the government from reenacting the zero-tolerance policy in the future.""",/en/global-issues/
India's top court rejects legalizing same-sex marriages,"    India’s top court refused to legalize same-sex marriages, with the chief justice of the country saying that it was up to Parliament to create such a law. ","India's top court declined on Tuesday, October 17, to legalize same-sex marriages but said the country had a duty to acknowledge LGBTQ+ relationships and to protect them from discrimination.A five-judge constitutional bench – set up to consider important questions of law – began hearing submissions seeking the legalization of same-sex marriages in April, with arguments completed in May. Advocates representing nearly two dozen petitioners said it was time for India to treat the country's LGBTQ+ community as equal citizens under its constitution.But their verdict said that the charter did not guarantee a fundamental right to marry that would extend to same-sex couples under existing law. ""It lies within the domain of parliament and state legislatures to determine the law on marriage,"" Supreme Court Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said during his verdict.Chandrachud added that India still had a duty to acknowledge same-sex relationships and protect those in them from discrimination. ""Our ability to feel love and affection for one another makes us feel human,"" he said from the bench. ""This court has recognized that equality demands that queer unions and queer persons are not discriminated against.""The news was nonetheless greeted with disappointment by those who had gathered outside the court in the hopes of celebrating India becoming the second Asian jurisdiction outside Taiwan to legalize same-sex marriages.The petitioners had said validating same-sex marriage would help them access some of the legal benefits of matrimony, including adoption, insurance and inheritance.But the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has staunchly opposed same-sex marriage, and said that any change was up to parliament, not the courts. ""Any interference (...) would cause a complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws in the country and in accepted societal values,"" the government said in its submission. ""Living together as partners and having sexual relationship by same-sex individuals... is not comparable with the Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children,"" it added.Marriages are governed by family laws for specific religions, such as the Muslim Marriage Act and the Hindu Marriage Act. The judges have been considering whether the Special Marriage Act of 1954 – which allows marriages between people of different castes and religions – could be expanded.A landmark ruling in 2018 struck down the British colonial-era law criminalizing gay sex, and last year the court ruled that unmarried partners or same-sex couples were entitled to welfare benefits.",/en/global-issues/
Refusing to normalize anti-Semitism,"Since October 7, French Jews have been confronted with a growing number of attacks and hate acts. But this is not just the result of a new outbreak of conflict in the Middle East. In reality, anti-Semitism, in its various guises, has taken root in our society.","The figures are here, and so is the fear. Since October 7, French Jews have returned to the anxieties that every new outbreak of conflict in the Middle East exposes them to: ostracism; the designation of their community as jointly responsible for violence elsewhere; and a sense of danger, too, in the face of increasing aggression and hate acts – the police have recorded over a thousand in the last month.Experts trace the rise of anti-Semitism in France back to the second Palestinian Intifada in 2000. It would be wrong, however, to regard this phenomenon as an episodic eruption, linked to regular outbreaks of unrest in the Middle East. In reality, anti-Semitism, in its many guises, has taken root in our society. In addition to the deep-seated anti-Semitism of the far right – which, in its new form, has not totally renounced the DNA of its origins – there are now the ambiguities and excesses of certain parts of the far left under the guise of anti-Zionism and the anti-Semitism of radical Islam.The anxiety of French Jews is amplified by a feeling of isolation and abandonment in the face of society's growing indifference to this rise in anti-Semitism. Over the years, after the initial wave of indignation, the ranks of demonstrators protesting anti-Semitic crimes have thinned, as if we were witnessing a normalization of this violence. Increasingly, Jews find themselves alone at these gatherings. ""There aren't many people left to support us,"" noted a demonstrator in Paris the day after the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, in the survey published today by Le Monde.This terrorist attack by Hamas, unprecedented in its scale and brutality, and the worldwide reaction to Israel's massive and indiscriminate retaliation in Gaza have generated a new element of fear among French Jews: aliyah is no longer seen as a refuge. Every time there has been an outbreak of anti-Semitic violence in France since the 2000s, a growing number have chosen to leave for Israel. Today, the Hamas attack has shown that even Israel can no longer guarantee their safety.The upsurge in anti-Semitic acts is not limited to France. In the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, where the phenomenon is particularly concerning, incidents and attacks have increased, as has intolerance, particularly in intellectual debate. But this is no excuse for France. It is home to the largest Jewish community in Europe, and the third largest in the world after Israel and the US. French Jews are part of its identity and history. It is unacceptable that a segment of the French nation, whatever its origin or religion, should be the target of regular hate campaigns and live in fear.By making almost 500 arrests since October 7, the authorities have shown that they intend to react vigorously to this new wave of anti-Semitic acts. It is also up to French society as a whole to rededicate itself to its fundamental values and to remind people again and again, particularly through education, that anti-Semitism, like racism, is unacceptable. Anti-Semitism must be neither commonplace, nor normalized or inexorable.",/en/global-issues/
Germany takes tougher line on immigration,"    Following a conference, the Federal and Länder governments adopted a series of measures designed to stem the flow of undocumented migrants and tighten asylum policy. ","On Tuesday, November 7, after a night of negotiations, the German regions and the federal government agreed on a series of measures aimed at tightening immigration and asylum policy across the Rhine. For Germany, which over the past two years has adopted an open approach, guided by the urgent need to fill its labor shortage, this marks a turning point. The prevailing view is that the country has ""reached its limits,"" to use an expression widely deployed by politicians of all stripes. ""We need mechanisms to ensure that the number of refugees arriving here, especially through illegal immigration, is contained,"" declared Malu Dreyer, the Social Democrat Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate, ahead of the negotiations.The package of measures announced on Tuesday morning includes provisions to reduce the time taken to process asylum applications and to speed up the time taken to appeal these decisions, which often take years.The government also wants to conclude agreements with migrants' countries of origin and transit to facilitate deportations in exchange for legal immigration to Germany. Berlin wants to tighten controls at Europe's internal borders and is considering examining the status of asylum seekers in third countries. Family reunification is to be restricted, and a multi-party commission is to evaluate a reform of asylum law. A new division of financial burdens between the federal state and the regions was also agreed upon.The signal for this about-turn on migration had already been given by the chancellery on October 20. In an interview with Spiegel, Olaf Scholz declared that Germany ""must finally carry out large-scale deportations."" This was a new demonstration of firmness on the part of the Social Democrat chancellor, who in January said at the Davos conference that ""those who want to roll up their sleeves are welcome in Germany."" Nine months later, with the country in recession and the far right on the rise, it was no longer a time for invitations but for strict restrictions on illegal migratory flows, in consultation with the Christian-Democrat opposition in the Bundestag.Politically, this is a delicate turning point, as the number of asylum seekers in Germany is very high. According to figures from the Office for Migration and Refugees, over 250,000 people applied for asylum between January and September this year, 60% of them from Syria, Afghanistan and Turkey. Their numbers could reach 300,000 by the end of the year, according to experts, after 240,000 in 2022. In addition, 1.2 million Ukrainians have arrived since February 2022, and are exempt from the asylum procedure.",/en/global-issues/
Macron faces dilemma over role at march against anti-Semitism,    It is still unclear whether the French president will attend the Paris march on Sunday. The only near-certainty is that he will be speaking on the subject in the next few days. ,"To go or not to go? Since the announcement, on the evening of Tuesday, November 7, that a ""great civic march"" against anti-Semitism would take place this Sunday in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron has been on the fence. Informed on Monday of the initiative spearheaded by Yaël Braun-Pivet, the president of the Assemblée Nationale, and Gérard Larcher, the president of the French Sénat, the head of state has been leaning towards not attending the march in person. But he plans to express himself on the subject between now and Sunday, in one form or another.The question of his participation in an event led by two major players in the French political establishment, one left-leaning (Braun-Pivet) and the other conservative (Larcher), is a dilemma for Macron. It comes as the country faces an upsurge in anti-Semitic acts since Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, with more than 1,000 recorded since the beginning of the conflict.""It would be great if Emmanuel Macron could be there, as it would give the event a historic dimension,"" said Yonathan Arfi, president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions, on November 9. ""We need this march because Jews in France need to hear the cry from the heart, the solidarity, the outpouring of fraternity from the French towards them in the face of anti-Semitism,"" he insisted.Two former presidents of the Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, several former prime ministers (Jean-Marc Ayrault, Manuel Valls, Bernard Cazeneuve, Edouard Philippe), and the presidents of the Assemblée Nationale and the Sénat will be at the front of the demonstration, which starts at 3 pm on Sunday from the Place des Invalides. Valls said that ""the presence of the President of the Republic would give this march a sense of national unity, and a dimension of overcoming divisions.""Jonathan Guémas, the response director of Macron's Renaissance party, said ""the real question is whether the place of a president is to be among the French or in action, setting the state in motion."" In his view, ""both positions are equal."" Before Macron, two presidents of the French Republic, in a moment of great tension, had considered that their place was ""among the French.""On May 14, 1990, François Mitterrand marched against racism and anti-Semitism, following the desecration of the Jewish cemetery in Carpentras, southeastern France. An old friend of Israel but also the author of a Knesset speech in March 1982 in which he expressed his support for a Palestinian state, Mitterrand demonstrated that day alongside the entire political class − with the exception of the far-right Front National − against an act which was then seen as a resurgence of the far right.",/en/global-issues/
Ohio votes to enshrine right to abortion in state constitution,"    Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment that ensures access to abortion and other forms of reproductive health care, the latest victory for abortion rights supporters since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. ","Residents of Ohio voted on Tuesday, November 7, to enshrine the right to an abortion in the Republican-run US state's constitution, American media projected, in what could be a bellwether for an issue that is likely to dominate next year's presidential race. With a little more than half of the votes counted, US media, including CNN and ABC News, said the referendum on so-called Issue 1 would pass with more ""yes"" votes, approving an amendment to the state constitution that would affirm the right to ""make and carry out one's own reproductive decisions,"" including abortion.President Joe Biden, who has made abortion rights a keystone issue of his presidency, said Ohioans ""voted to protect their fundamental freedoms."" ""Ohioans and voters across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy,"" Biden said in a statement, referring to his likely 2024 opponent Donald Trump's slogan ""Make America Great Again."" Biden also called efforts to curb reproductive rights ""extreme and dangerous.""With the 2024 election looming, America's political watchers have their eyes on Ohio, where activists on both sides of the reproductive rights issue have waged a fierce, multi-million-dollar campaign. Tuesday's vote comes 17 months after the Supreme Court struck down the national right to abortion, paving the way for some states to completely outlaw the practice, even in cases of rape or incest.In Ohio, the reversal of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision triggered a state law that would ban all abortions after a heartbeat is detected in the womb – usually around six weeks of gestation before many people even know they are pregnant. The law is currently suspended as it winds its way through legal challenges, meaning that for now, it is still possible to obtain an abortion in Ohio up to about 22 weeks of pregnancy. But it sparked a national outcry for the short time it was allowed to remain in effect last year when a 10-year-old rape survivor was forced to travel to neighboring Indiana for an abortion after being denied care at home.A ""yes"" vote victory on Ohio's referendum, known as Issue 1, enshrines the right for the state's residents to ""make and carry out one's own reproductive decisions,"" including on abortion. It does, however, allow abortions to be prohibited after ""fetal viability"" – when a fetus can survive on its own outside the womb – unless a doctor believes a pregnant patient's life or health is in danger.An August measure that would have made Ohio constitutional amendments harder to achieve – put up for a vote in direct response to the looming abortion referendum – was soundly defeated. But voters in the state – won by Trump in 2016 and 2020 – have drifted right.Governor Mike DeWine warned that the ballot language would open the door to abortions at ""any time during the pregnancy,"" with the possibility of minors obtaining abortions without their parents' knowledge. The ""Yes"" camp has called that kind of framing ""disinformation.""Many conservative US voters – if not their elected representatives – have expressed reservations about how far restrictions on abortion have gone after the overturning of Roe. Over the past year, multiple states including California, Kansas and Kentucky voted to preserve abortion rights or voted down efforts to restrict them.Conservative-leaning Kentucky on Tuesday was projected to re-elect incumbent Democratic Governor Andy Beshear, who made abortion rights a key issue in his battle against Republican Daniel Cameron. In Virginia, Republicans hope a win in legislative races will allow them to tighten abortion restrictions.",/en/global-issues/
Amazon faces legal action for homophobic chants broadcast during PSG match,"    During the September 24 match between PSG and Marseille, thousands of PSG supporters chanted homophobic slurs referring to their opponents. Four PSG players were given suspended one-match bans for joining in the chants. ","A French gay rights group said on Wednesday, November 8, it had launched legal action against Amazon Prime for offering on streaming replay a football match between Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille in which homophobic chants were audible.During the September 24 match between the bitter Ligue 1 rivals, thousands of PSG supporters chanted homophobic slogans referring to their opponents. An Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporter covering the game said the chanting in PSG's Parc des Princes stadium went on for around 10 minutes.Four PSG players, including Randal Kolo Muani and Ousmane Dembélé, were given suspended one-match bans for also chanting insults directed at the Marseille players while celebrating their 4-0 thrashing of their opponents.A lawyer for the LGBT Families group said it had filed a criminal complaint against Amazon Prime for offering the game on replay, noting that while broadcasters are not responsible for offensive content that may occur during a live match they are liable for content offered on replay.The complaint says that during the replay, ""you can hear several chants from fans coming from the stands, some of which are distinctly homophobic in nature.""Two other LGBT rights groups, Mousse and Stop Homophobie, have said they will also join the complaint against Amazon for public insults and incitement to hatred or violence against people based on their sexual orientation.Amazon said that the match was no longer available on Prime Video at the time the complaint was announced and that, as a broadcaster, it did not condone the comments or behavior of certain fans. ""Homophobia has no place in sport or in society, and we condemn it, like all forms of discrimination, in the strongest possible terms"", an Amazon spokesperson told AFP.The four PSG players sanctioned last month over the chants – Kolo Muani, Dembele, Achraf Hakimi and Layvin Kurzawa – apologized for their behavior, saying they got ""carried away"" by their trouncing of Marseille and promised in future to ""respect our duty to set an example."" PSG for its part was ordered to close the Auteuil stand of the Parc des Princes for one game.The Rouge Direct (Straight Red Card) group, which campaigns against homophobia in sport, backed the complaint against Amazon Prime as part of what it called the ""fight against the trivialisation of homophobia in football"".It said that Amazon Prime had promised, following an earlier complaint this year, to stop broadcasting homophobic chants during replays, and accused the streaming giant of betraying its word.A poll published in September by the Federation Sportive LGBT+ association showed homophobia continued to be rampant in French sport, with 46% of those questioned said they themselves had seen homophobic or transphobic behavior in sports.Last season, several Ligue 1 players refused an invitation to wear rainbow-coloured insignia on their jerseys as a gesture against homophobia, a campaign supported, however, by the vast majority of players.",/en/global-issues/
US approves first vaccine against chikungunya virus,"    The vaccine, which will be marketed under the name Ixchiq, was approved for people 18 and over who are at increased risk of exposure, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday. The US drug regulator's decision is expected to speed the vaccine's rollout in countries where the virus is most prevalent. ","US health authorities on Thursday, November 9, approved the world's first vaccine for chikungunya, a virus spread by infected mosquitoes that the Food and Drug Administration called ""an emerging global health threat.""The vaccine, developed by Europe's Valneva which will be marketed under the name Ixchiq, was approved for people 18 and over who are at increased risk of exposure, the FDA said.Ixchiq's green light by the US drug regulator is expected to speed the vaccine's rollout in countries where the virus is most prevalent. Chikungunya, which causes fever and severe joint pain, is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia and part of the Americas. ""However, chikungunya virus has spread to new geographical areas causing a rise in global prevalence of the disease,"" the FDA said, reporting more than 5 million cases in the past 15 years.""Infection with chikungunya virus can lead to severe disease and prolonged health problems, particularly for older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions,"" senior FDA official Peter Marks said in a statement. ""Today's approval addresses an unmet medical need and is an important advancement in the prevention of a potentially debilitating disease with limited treatment options.""The vaccine is injected in one dose and contains a live, weakened version of the chikungunya virus, as is standard with other vaccines.Two clinical trials were carried out in North America on 3,500 people. Headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, fever and nausea were commonly reported side effects. Serious reactions were reported in 1.6 % of Ixchiq recipients in the trials, with two requiring hospitalization.",/en/global-issues/
"On the French-Italian border, migrant arrivals increase, as do pushbacks",Feature,"Of all the crossing points between France and Italy, the Saint-Louis bridge is undoubtedly the most picturesque. Imagine a road suspended on a rock face between Menton, a town in the south-east of France, and Grimaldi, in Italy: on one side, the steep, cave-carved mountains; on the other, a landscape of terraced farmland running down to the coast. Far below, the Mediterranean glowed mauve on this early autumn morning, when the sun was not yet shining.But this sublime place was filled with a sense of despair. For every day, this stretch of road, framed by the police stations of both countries, plays host to a tragic ballet of migrants who come and go, a long procession of unfortunate people expelled from France. Handed over to the Italian police, they will try their luck first once, 10 times, 20 times, until they manage to cross this border on which France has re-established controls since 2015. ""In the end, most of them make it,"" said Loïc Le Dall, a member of the local branch of the Association Nationale d'Assistance aux Frontières pour les Etrangers (ANAFE). Some even take the most dangerous routes, such as on the roofs of trains or the vertiginous path known here as the ""pas de la mort."" But in the meantime, they are caught up in a strange game of political-police ping-pong, which has become both a legal and humanitarian headache.What could this woman standing on the parapet between the two border posts have been thinking? With her face pressed against the fence, she looked out over the sea and beyond to the lights of Menton. Near her, two very young children were shivering in their cotton clothes. Further on, her husband climbed the slope pulling a small suitcase. They were Kurds, fleeing Turkey for political reasons, they said.In their group, formed by chance contact with a people smuggler, was another family with children and a teenager accompanied by his mother. Poyraz was 17 years old, wearing his headphones on his neck, and he wanted to make something clear by quickly making a sign of the cross, with his back turned so that his companions couldn't see him: ""We're Orthodox,"" he said quietly. ""It's very difficult for us in Turkey.""Three steps away, two Nigerians looked up at a blue sign on the side of the road: ""Menton, the pearl of France, is happy to welcome you."" With empty hands, they looked distraught, lost. They had nothing, no suitcase, no telephone, no headphones and not a single bag, even a paper one – even in extreme misery, there are hierarchies. Above all, like many migrants, they had very few words in English or French to explain their situation. The oldest managed to formulate a question, putting together a few scraps of English: ""Why don't they let us in?""",/en/global-issues/
"Pope Francis removes a leading conservative critic as bishop of Tyler, Texas","    It is rare for the pope to remove a bishop from office. Earlier this year, the Vatican sent in investigators to look into his governance of the diocese, amid reports that he was making unorthodox claims. ","Pope Francis on Saturday, November 11, ordered the removal of the bishop of Tyler, Texas, a conservative prelate active on social media who has been a fierce critic of the pontiff and has come to symbolize the polarization within the US Catholic hierarchy.A one-line statement from the Vatican said Francis had ""relieved"" Bishop Joseph Strickland of the pastoral governance of Tyler and appointed the bishop of Austin as the temporary administrator.Strickland, 65, has emerged as a leading critic of Francis, accusing him in a tweet earlier this year of ""undermining the deposit of faith."" He has been particularly critical of Francis' recent meeting on the future of the Catholic Church during which hot-button issues were discussed, including ways to better welcome LGBTQ+ Catholics.Earlier this year, the Vatican sent in investigators to look into his governance of the diocese, amid reports that priests and laypeople in Tyler had complained and that he was making unorthodox claims.The Vatican never released the findings and Strickland had insisted he wouldn't resign voluntarily, saying in media interviews that he was given a mandate to serve as bishop in 2012 by the late Pope Benedict XVI and couldn't abdicate that responsibility.The conservative website LifeSiteNews, which said it interviewed Strickland on Saturday, quoted him as saying one of the reasons given for his ouster was his refusal to implement Francis' 2021 restrictions on celebrating the old Latin Mass.Francis' crackdown on the old liturgy has become a rallying cry for traditionalist Catholics opposed to the pontiff's progressive bent. Strickland told LifeSite he refused to implement the restrictions ""because I can't starve out part of my flock."" He said he stood by his decision, would do it again and ""I feel very much at peace in the Lord and the truth that he died for.""His firing sparked an immediate outcry among some conservatives and traditionalists who had held up Strickland as a leading point of Catholic reference to counter Francis' progressive reforms. Michael J. Matt, editor of the traditionalist newspaper The Remnant, wrote that with the firing, Francis was ""actively trying to bury fidelity to the Church of Jesus Christ."" ""This is total war,"" Matt wrote on X, formerly Twitter.The two Vatican investigators sent to investigate Strickland – Bishop Dennis Sullivan of Camden, NJ, and the retired bishop of Tucson, Arizona, Bishop Emeritus Gerald Kicanas – ""conducted an exhaustive inquiry into all aspects of the governance and leadership of the diocese,"" said the head of the church in Texas, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo.After their investigation, a recommendation was made to Francis that ""the continuation in office of Bishop Strickland was not feasible,"" DiNardo said in a statement Saturday. The Vatican asked Strickland to resign Thursday, but he declined, prompting Francis to remove him from office two days later, DiNardo's statement said.It is rare for the pope to remove a bishop from office. Bishops are required to offer to resign when they reach 75. When the Vatican uncovers issues with governance or other problems that require a bishop to leave office before then, the Vatican usually seeks to pressure him to offer to resign for the good of his diocese and the church.That was the case when another US bishop was forced out earlier this year following a Vatican investigation. Bishop Richard Stika of Knoxville, Tennessee, resigned voluntarily, albeit under pressure, following allegations he mishandled sex abuse allegations and his priests complained about his leadership and behavior. But with Strickland, the Vatican statement made clear that he had not offered to resign and that Francis had instead ""relieved"" him from his job.Francis has not been shy about his concerns about the right wing in the US Catholic hierarchy, which has been split between progressives and conservatives who long found support in the doctrinaire papacies of St. John Paul II and Benedict XVI, particularly on issues of abortion and same-sex marriage.In comments to Portuguese Jesuits in August, Francis blasted the ""backwardness"" of these conservative bishops, saying they had replaced faith with ideology and that a correct understanding of Catholic doctrine allows for change over time.Strickland had been associated with the most extreme of these bishops, including the former Vatican ambassador to the US, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, a fierce Francis critic who in 2018 called for the pope to resign.Strickland backed Vigano's conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 pandemic, and on Saturday Vigano wrote that Strickland's ouster showed a ""cowardly form of authoritarianism"" by Francis. ""This affair will reveal who stands with the true Church of Christ and who chooses to stand with His declared enemies,"" Vigano wrote on X.Most recently, Strickland had criticized Francis' monthlong closed-door debate on making the church more welcoming and responsive to the needs of Catholics today. The meeting debated a host of previously taboo issues, including women in governance roles and welcoming LGBTQ+ Catholics, but in the end, its final document didn't veer from established doctrine.Ahead of the meeting, Strickland said it was a ""travesty"" that such things were even on the table for discussion. ""Regrettably, it may be that some will label as schismatics those who disagree with the changes being proposed,"" Strickland wrote in a public letter in August. ""Instead, those who would propose changes to that which cannot be changed seek to commandeer Christ's Church, and they are indeed the true schismatics.""In a statement Saturday, the diocese of Tyler announced Strickland's removal but said the church's work would continue in Tyler. ""Our mission is to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to foster an authentic Christian community, and to serve the needs of all people with compassion and love,"" it said.",/en/global-issues/
Inside the kitchens of migrant women in Tunisia,Feature,"The oil began to bubble. Léna Pouye grabbed four good looking sea bream from the kitchen table and threw them one by one into the pan. The sound of sizzling filled the room. Lying in wait on the doorstep overlooking the street, a ginger cat meowed in disappointment at seeing its prey disappear. Pouye shooed him away with her foot and the little feline immediately returned to his life in the gutters on this warm October afternoon. Two months had passed since 47-year-old Pouye moved with her daughter, 11-year-old Yasmine, to a small apartment in Cité Ettahrir, a working-class district in the west of Tunis. In the room where they live and sleep, divided in two by a partition, everything served as a reminder of her native Senegal: The jersey of the national football team (the Lions of Teranga), the boubou robes, the dried hibiscus flowers, and even the thieb she was preparing, ""the favorite dish of the Senegalese!"" she announced proudly.These little details enable her to keep alive the connection with the country she left 13 years ago to settle in Tunisia and to pass on a little of her cultural heritage to her daughter. They also carry a sense of nostalgia. ""I think about Senegal every day,"" she said wistfully. Before becoming the primary gateway to Europe for migrants, Tunisia had long been a welcoming land for many women from West Africa, lured by the prospect of higher wages than in their home countries. This particular type of immigration was also facilitated by numerous human trafficking networks. But the worsening socio-economic crisis, the rise in racist violence and tensions over the migration issue have all taken their toll on this economic appeal, driving many of them to leave. Those who have stayed are also considering it. ""You shouldn't deny your fate, but even so, I'd like to go somewhere else,"" said Pouye.Despite this urge to leave, the Senegalese woman has spent many years in Tunisia. When she moved there to work as a private chef, she remembered much more hospitable conditions. ""During Ben Ali's time, it wasn't like this. I was comfortable, people respected each other and life was cheaper,"" she said, somewhat nostalgic for the old regime. She then lived through the 2011 revolution, giving birth to Yasmine two years after her arrival. After her divorce, followed by her ex-husband's return to Senegal, Pouye found herself raising her child alone. ""He left me to handle it all,"" she said. ""I was the one who did everything for my daughter. It wasn't easy, but I had to take on my responsibilities.""As a single migrant woman struggling against social injunctions, Pouye has faced many challenges: Educating Yasmine, providing for both of them, navigating the bureaucracy, dealing with the scrutiny and comments of Tunisian society, and holding down several jobs. Her determination, coupled with a strong character, enabled her to overcome it all. ""This is a country of 'mahboul' [madmen, in Tunisian Arabic]. So I have to be even more mahboul,"" she laughed.The Covid pandemic was the last straw. Due to the lockdown, she lost her job, found herself without income and soon without a roof over her head. ""I slept with my daughter in the street because the landlord kicked us out. She cried herself sick,"" she said, her voice filled with pain. Since then, nothing has been the same. Pouye has experienced employment and housing insecurity, moving from apartment to apartment to keep pace with the ever-increasing rents, going through periods without work, and having to deal with the uncertainties of the local economy. ""Before, I used to cook at home, and people would order dishes for 10 or 15 people. But with the shortages, the lack of rice and sugar, how do you expect me to work? What's more, prices have gone up because of inflation, but customers don't want to pay more.""Even back then, she was already thinking about returning to Senegal. But, with a child to support, she tried to bounce back and turned to apprenticeships, convinced that a qualification could open the door to stable employment. She enrolled in a cooking and pastry-making course run by the Ftartchi? organization for migrant women. The course aims to promote ""integration in the workplace,"" explained 29-year-old Yosra Lachheb, an award-winning professional pastry chef and instructor. ""Women work more than men in the pastry business. It's easier for them to get a job in this sector than in others.""A number of former students were able to find regular work after completing their training. However, today, the vast majority of them are no longer in Tunisia. ""Most of the former beneficiaries are now in Europe or back home,"" said Aida, the organization's director, explaining that they were prompted to leave by the wave of racism unleashed on February 21 by President Kais Saied's speech against the ""hordes of illegal migrants.""Despite this, the training courses continue. At the organization's premises, located in the northern suburbs of the capital, a new group gathered around the work surface. ""We let the butter melt until the whey separates from the fat,"" said 34-year-old Rebecca Dyali, diligently. ""This is what we call clarifying the butter,"" added Lachheb, in a teacherly manner. In this large stainless steel kitchen, the notion of integration has given way to aspirations for somewhere else. ""I want to go to Europe,"" said Dyali. ""Well, not necessarily in Europe, but to another country. In any case, I need to know how to do something, and pastry is widely consumed everywhere.""After working in Tunisia for almost three years, she no longer sees herself staying. She blames the insecurity and attacks, the challenges of finding employment and accommodation, and the lack of prospects for the future. Her compatriot, Marcelle Nyabri, who arrived four years ago, shares the same sentiment but is already planning her return. ""If I go back to Côte d'Ivoire, this training will enable me to work independently, to mix our traditional pastry-making traditions with those of Tunisia. It will bring about change,"" she said, excited at the prospect of one day owning her own store.Even Nathalie Diby, one of the standout students from the previous ""class,"" who has now found a job as a cook, was contemplating the future. ""Before I found a job, it was very difficult. Now I feel good here. I'd like to stay in Tunisia, if the pay increases and if I make progress,"" she said, hopeful but realistic. ""The situation has calmed down since February, but who knows how it will develop?"" ""One day, we'll all go back,"" said Dyali.Diby, Dyali and Nyabri are resilient, but most of their friends and acquaintances have already left the country. As for Pouye, she keeps putting off her return for fear of disrupting her daughter. ""How is she going to keep her friends?"" she said. She didn't respond to the repatriation planes that Senegal sent in February after the waves of violence. She considered the departure too hasty after so many years. Nor is she tempted to set sail, which has never been an option for her. She is waiting for the right moment. ""When I return to Senegal, I won't be bringing back wealth but life experience,"" she said. ""I'll be a strong woman, having served in the army here in Tunisia.""",/en/global-issues/
"Over 180,000 rally against anti-Semitism across France","    President Macron, who did not attend the demonstrations, condemned on Sunday the 'unbearable resurgence of unbridled anti-Semitism' in the country. ","182,000 people turned out on Sunday, November 12, to march against anti-Semitism across France, including 105,000 in Paris, according to the Ministry of Interior and the police prefecture. ""Our order of the day today is... the total fight against anti-Semitism which is the opposite of the values of the republic,"" Senate speaker Gérard Larcher, who organized the Paris demonstration with Assemblée Nationale speaker Yaël Braun-Pivet, told broadcaster LCP before the marchers set off.Tensions have been rising in the French capital – home to large Jewish and Muslim communities – in the wake of the October 7 attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel, followed by a month of Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Around 500,000 Jewish people live in France, making up Europe's largest community. More than 3,000 police and gendarmes were to be deployed to maintain security at the march.At the front of the march were Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, the two speakers and dignitaries including former presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as religious leaders.Earlier Sunday, thousands of people also gathered in major French cities including Lyon, Nice and Strasbourg behind the same slogan as the Paris march: ""For the Republic, against anti-Semitism"".""Everyone should feel like it's their business"" to combat anti-Jewish feeling, France's chief rabbi Haim Korsia told broadcaster Radio J.On the eve of the march, President Emmanuel Macron – who did not attend Sunday – condemned the ""unbearable resurgence of unbridled anti-Semitism"" in the country. ""A France where our Jewish citizens are afraid is not France,"" he wrote in a letter published in Saturday's Le Parisien. Macron condemned the ""confusion"" surrounding the rally and said it was being ""exploited"" by some politicians for their own ends.The hard-left La France Insoumise (LFI) party boycotted the event which the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party members attended. LFI leader Jean-Luc Melenchon rejected the march as a meeting of ""friends of unconditional support for the massacre"" of Palestinians in Gaza. A separate rally against anti-Semitism that LFI organized in western Paris was disrupted on Sunday morning by counter-demonstrators.Far-right leader Marine Le Pen – who also encountered protesters as she arrived to the main march – declared the demonstration should also serve to stand against ""Islamic fundamentalism"", a pet theme of her anti-immigrant party. The RN was known for decades as the Front National (FN), led by her father Jean-Marie Le Pen – a convicted Holocaust denier. Aiming to show the party has changed, ""We are exactly where we should be"" taking part in the march, Le Pen told reporters shortly before it began, calling any objections ""petty political quibbles"".Communist leader Fabien Roussel said he would ""not march alongside"" the RN. Other left-wing parties as well as youth and rights organisations marched behind a common banner separated from the far right.Prime Minister Borne said Sunday, ""There is no place for posturing"" at the march, writing on X that ""this is a vital battle for national cohesion"". Borne's own father survived the Nazi death camp Auschwitz in occupied Poland, only to take his own life when she was 11.The march took place a day after several thousand people demonstrated in Paris under the rallying cry ""Stop the massacre in Gaza"". The left-wing organizers called for France to ""demand an immediate ceasefire"" between Israel and Hamas militants.",/en/global-issues/
Brussels attack suspect dies after being shot by police,    Belgian police opened fire on the man suspected of shooting and killing two people on Monday night in Brussels. ,"Belgian police on Tuesday, October 17, shot dead a man suspected of killing two Swedish football fans in what authorities said was a terrorist attack. The weapon believed to have been used by the man in the attack was recovered, Belgian Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden.The suspected attacker, Abdessalem Lassoued, a 45-year-old Tunisian, was found by police on Tuesday morning in a café in the neighborhood of Schaerbeek. After police shot him, he was taken to hospital, where he died of his injuries.Belgium's Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden wrote on X: ""The perpetrator of the terrorist attack in Brussels has been identified and has died. We thank intelligence and security services as well as the public prosecutor's office for their quick and decisive action yesterday evening and this morning.""Prime Minister Alexander de Croo earlier on Tuesday said the suspect was a man of Tunisian origin who had been living in the country illegally.""The terrorist attack that happened yesterday was committed with total cowardice, the attacker chose as a target two Swedish football fans,"" de Croo told a news conference, adding that a third person was seriously wounded.Sweden expressed its devastation over the shooting – which occurred just before a Belgium-Sweden football match Monday evening – and European leaders were quick to offer their solidarity.Sweden has been at the center of a bitter row this year with Muslim countries after multiple burnings of the Koran, Islam's holy book. In a video posted in Arabic on social media, a man identifying himself as the attacker said ""he was inspired by the Islamic State"" extremist group, prosecutors said.The gunman was wearing a high-visibility orange jacket and fled on a scooter. Belgian authorities raised the terror alert for Brussels to level four or ""very serious"" – the highest – and level three nationally.Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborn said the asylum seeker was convicted in Tunisia ""for common law offenses"" but was not a reported terrorist risk. Prosecutors said in his video, Lassoued had indicated the Swedish nationality of his victims was a motivation, but there appeared to be no links with the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East.""Devastated by the news of two Swedish football supporters murdered in Brussels tonight and a third person being seriously wounded. All my thoughts are with their families and loved ones,"" Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said. ""Swedish authorities are working closely with their Belgian partners to find the murderer,"" he added on social media.As news spread of the killings, the Group F European qualifier match was abandoned at half-time. Some 35,000 fans were held in the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels for two and a half hours, before being evacuated.Officers provided extra protection for Swedish nationals at the game, escorting Sweden's national players directly to the airport to leave safely, Belgium's football association CEO told the RTBF channel.""I am terribly sad. We agreed 100% not to play the second half because of the conditions and out of respect for the victims and their families,"" said Sweden coach Janne Andersson, quoted by the Swedish news agency TT.The shooting took place in the city center's northern districts. Police were alerted to the incident after 7:00 pm local time.In a video shared online by Flemish newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws, the shooter is seen with an automatic weapon on his shoulder, fleeing on a scooter. Four gunshots can be heard in the video. A witness who spoke to the LN24 channel described his shock during the incident. ""I stood there frozen, I didn't move. I was shocked by what happened, even now I am still in shock. It was a man who came, pushed me, told me to start running if I wanted to stay alive,"" said the witness, who gave his name as Sulayman.The president of the European Commission, which is based in Brussels, was quick to condemn the attack. ""My thoughts are with the families of the two victims of the despicable attack in Brussels,"" Ursula von der Leyen posted on social media. ""Together, we stand united against terror,"" she said.French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe was ""shaken"" by an ""Islamist"" attack in Brussels, while France's interior minister had earlier given instructions to strengthen border controls with Belgium. Belgium had already been the target of an attack claimed by Islamic State extremists in March 2016, at Brussels' main airport and on the metro system, which killed 32 people.",/en/global-issues/
