Ex-doctor goes on trial in France over Rwanda genocide,"    Sosthene Munyemana, 68, is accused of organizing torture and killings during the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda. He has lived in France since 1994. ","A Rwandan former gynecologist went on trial in France on Tuesday, November 14, on charges of committing genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1994 massacres in Rwanda, in an investigation stretching back nearly three decades. It is one of France's longest-running cases.Sixty-eight-year-old Sosthene Munyemana appeared before the criminal court in the French capital nearly 30 years after a complaint was filed against him in the southwestern French city of Bordeaux in 1995. The former gynecologist, accused of organizing torture and killings during the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda, arrived late for the hearing. Wearing a blue striped shirt and a grey jacket, Munyemana apologized for the delay, before stating his identity. He has lived in France since 1994.Munyemana, who denies the charges, faces life in prison if convicted. The trial, scheduled to last five weeks, will be recorded for historical archives. Nearly 70 witnesses are expected to testify. It is the sixth such trial in France of an alleged participant in the massacres, in which around 800,000 people, most of them ethnic Tutsis, were slaughtered over 100 days.""We're waiting for justice to be done at last,"" Rachel Lindon, a lawyer representing 26 victims, said ahead of the trial. ""The more time passes, the fewer witnesses we have,"" she added.In 2008, France rejected an asylum request by Munyemana, who worked in a hospital at Villeneuve-sur-Lot in southwest France for a decade. But it also in 2010 rejected an extradition request from Rwanda after Munyemana's lawyers argued he could not receive a fair trial there. In 2011, a French court charged the father of three on suspicion he took part in the 1994 genocide.An ethnic Hutu, he lived in Butare in southern Rwanda at the time of the massacre. France has been one of the top destinations for fugitives fleeing justice over the Rwandan slaughter. Rwanda under President Paul Kagame has accused Paris of not being willing to extradite genocide suspects or bring them to justice. Since 2014, France has tried and convicted several figures including a former spy chief, two ex-mayors and a former hotel chauffeur.""He was a doctor, a well-known man who was much appreciated,"" said Emmanuel Daoud, a lawyer for the two rights organizations, the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) and the Human Rights League (LDH). ""He could not have been unaware of what was happening,"" he added.Munyemana was close to Jean Kambanda, the head of the interim government established after the plane carrying then-president Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down by a missile in 1994. He is accused of signing a letter of support for the interim government, which encouraged the massacre of the Tutsis. He is also accused of keeping Tutsi civilians in inhumane conditions in local government offices to which he had the key.Munyemana does not deny having held the key but argues that the offices served as a ""refuge"" for Tutsis who were seeking protection. Munyemana's lawyer, Jean-Yves Dupeux, argued that the case ""rests only"" on eyewitness accounts that date back to decades ago. ""It's very difficult to rely on testimonies about something that happened so long ago,"" he said.Munyemana worked as an emergency doctor in southwestern France before switching to geriatrics. More than 800,000 people, mainly minority Tutsis, were massacred by Hutu soldiers and extremist militias in the Rwandan genocide from April to July 1994, according to UN figures.",Global-issues,rwandan former gynecologist went trial france tuesday november charges committing genocide crimes humanity massacres rwanda investigation stretching back nearly three decades one frances longest running cases sixty eight year old sosthene munyemana appeared criminal court french capital nearly years complaint filed southwestern french city bordeaux former gynecologist accused organizing torture killings genocide tutsis rwanda arrived late hearing wearing blue striped shirt grey jacket munyemana apologized delay stating identity lived france since munyemana denies charges faces life prison convicted trial scheduled last five weeks recorded historical archives nearly witnesses expected testify sixth trial france alleged participant massacres around people ethnic tutsis slaughtered days waiting justice done last rachel lindon lawyer representing victims said ahead trial time passes fewer witnesses added france rejected asylum request munyemana worked hospital villeneuve sur lot southwest france decade also rejected extradition request rwanda munyemanas lawyers argued could receive fair trial french court charged father three sus took part genocide ethnic hutu lived butare southern rwanda time massacre france one top destinations fugitives fleeing justice rwandan slaughter rwanda president paul kagame accused paris willing extradite genocide suspects bring justice since france tried convicted several figures including former spy chief two mayors former hotel chauffeur doctor well known man much appreciated said emmanuel daoud lawyer two rights organizations international federation human rights fidh human rights league ldh could unaware happening added munyemana close jean kambanda head interim government established plane carrying president juvenal habyarimana shot missile accused signing letter support interim government encouraged massacre tutsis also accused keeping tutsi civilians inhumane conditions local government offices key munyemana deny held key argues offices served refuge tutsis seeking protection munyemanas lawyer jean yves dupeux argued case rests eyewitness accounts date back decades ago difficult rely testimonies something happened long ago said munyemana worked emergency doctor southwestern france switching geriatrics people mainly minority tutsis massacred hutu soldiers extremist militias rwandan genocide april july according figures,rwandan former gynecologist went trial franc tuesday novemb charg commit genocid crime human massacr rwanda investig stretch back nearli three decad one franc longest run case sixti eight year old sosthen munyemana appear crimin court french capit nearli year complaint file southwestern french citi bordeaux former gynecologist accus organ tortur kill genocid tutsi rwanda arriv late hear wear blue stripe shirt grey jacket munyemana apolog delay state ident live franc sinc munyemana deni charg face life prison convict trial schedul last five week record histor archiv nearli wit expect testifi sixth trial franc alleg particip massacr around peopl ethnic tutsi slaughter day wait justic done last rachel lindon lawyer repres victim said ahead trial time pass fewer wit ad franc reject asylum request munyemana work hospit villeneuv sur lot southwest franc decad also reject extradit request rwanda munyemana lawyer argu could receiv fair trial french court charg father three su took part genocid ethnic hutu live butar southern rwanda time massacr franc one top destin fugit flee justic rwandan slaughter rwanda presid paul kagam accus pari will extradit genocid suspect bring justic sinc franc tri convict sever figur includ former spi chief two mayor former hotel chauffeur doctor well known man much appreci said emmanuel daoud lawyer two right organ intern feder human right fidh human right leagu ldh could unawar happen ad munyemana close jean kambanda head interim govern establish plane carri presid juven habyarimana shot missil accus sign letter support interim govern encourag massacr tutsi also accus keep tutsi civilian inhuman condit local govern offic key munyemana deni held key argu offic serv refug tutsi seek protect munyemana lawyer jean yve dupeux argu case rest eyewit account date back decad ago difficult reli testimoni someth happen long ago said munyemana work emerg doctor southwestern franc switch geriatr peopl mainli minor tutsi massacr hutu soldier extremist militia rwandan genocid april juli accord figur
"Being gay and Catholic, a difficult journey 'between two worlds'",    Some Catholics experience an ongoing internal conflict between their faith and their identity as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. This issue has become central to the deliberations of the synod taking place in Rome. ,"Antoine knew his identity early on and has never doubted it since. The 39-year-old was 10 when he realized he was attracted to men. Since then, explained the devout Catholic, ""everything gets stuck when you don't want to lie.""""Imagine being a young, practicing Catholic and having the feeling that hell is all around you, ready to swallow you up if you decide to make the slightest faux pas, like kissing another boy,"" said Antoine, who still keeps his sexual orientation a secret from some people, notably in his parish, requesting anonymity like most of those who agreed to share their stories.Trying to suppress his desires and reconcile them with his faith, Antoine decided to become a priest. ""It also helps to explain to others why, as a teenager, you don't like football, why you don't get into fights, why you don't have a girlfriend,"" he said with a smile. But a document published by the Vatican in 2005, banning the ordination of homosexual priests, halted his plans. He then chose to enter a monastery, a place where, he thought, chastity would be easier and temptations less prevalent. He stayed there from the time he was 22 until he was 36 and only started to embrace his love life after leaving.Like Antoine, many French people are struggling to reconcile their Catholic faith with their identity as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Although many parishes and clergy are striving to be more inclusive and sensitive to this issue, homosexuality is still considered problematic within the Church.Less conservative than his predecessors Benedict XVI and John Paul II, Pope Francis has repeatedly expressed his desire to create a more inclusive Church. Currently, the issue has surfaced at his Synod on Synodality, an important meeting on the future of the institution, being held from October 4 to 29 in Rome. The working documents of this major assembly raise questions about ""concrete"" measures to ""reach out to people who feel excluded from the Church because of their affectivity and sexuality"" (for example, remarried divorcees, people living in polygamous marriages, LGBTQ+ people, etc.).More specifically, it concerns the question of the blessing of homosexual couples, a request made by many believers but opposed by the most conservative elements of the Church, believing that it effectively amounts to the institution recognizing a lifestyle deemed ""disordered.""In Catholic teaching, being attracted to a person of the same sex is not a sin in itself, but sexual acts, practices or married life are considered sins. Thus, a fulfilling life, faithful to one's orientation, seems to be a challenge for believers because it opposes the Church's point of view. ""Suppression of feelings and desires,"" ""inner and moral suffering,"" ""loss of confidence and self-esteem,"" ""guilt and anxiety"": Many LGBTQ+ people feel excluded, with no real place within an institution where sexual morality essentially revolves around a heterosexual couple dedicated to procreation. ""French Catholicism is fairly conservative on these issues, compared to Germany and Belgium, despite the recent changes in the Church's perspective on the issue, particularly after the legalization of same-sex marriage. The clergy are having real difficulty speaking out on these subjects,"" explained Céline Béraud, sociologist at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales.",Global-issues,antoine knew identity early never doubted since year old realized attracted men since explained devout catholic everything gets stuck dont want lie imagine young practicing catholic feeling hell around ready swallow decide make slightest faux pas like kissing another boy said antoine still keeps sexual orientation secret people notably parish requesting anonymity like agreed share stories trying suppress desires reconcile faith antoine decided become priest also helps explain others teenager dont like football dont get fights dont girlfriend said smile document published vatican banning ordination homosexual priests halted plans chose enter monastery place thought chastity would easier temptations less prevalent stayed time started embrace love life leaving like antoine many french people struggling reconcile catholic faith identity member lgbtq community although many parishes clergy striving inclusive sensitive issue homosexuality still considered problematic within church less conservative predecessors benedict xvi john paul pope francis repeatedly expressed desire create inclusive church currently issue surfaced synod synodality important meeting future institution held october rome working documents major assembly raise questions concrete measures reach people feel excluded church affectivity sexuality example remarried divorcees people living polygamous marriages lgbtq people etc specifically concerns question blessing homosexual couples request made many believers opposed conservative elements church believing effectively amounts institution recognizing lifestyle deemed disordered catholic teaching attracted person sex sin sexual acts practices married life considered sins thus fulfilling life faithful ones orientation seems challenge believers opposes churchs point view suppression feelings desires inner moral suffering loss confidence self esteem guilt anxiety many lgbtq people feel excluded real place within institution sexual morality essentially revolves around heterosexual couple dedicated procreation french catholicism fairly conservative issues compared germany belgium despite recent changes churchs perspective issue particularly legalization sex marriage clergy real difficulty speaking subjects explained line raud sociologist ecole des hautes etudes sciences sociales,antoin knew ident earli never doubt sinc year old realiz attract men sinc explain devout cathol everyth get stuck dont want lie imagin young practic cathol feel hell around readi swallow decid make slightest faux pa like kiss anoth boy said antoin still keep sexual orient secret peopl notabl parish request anonym like agre share stori tri suppress desir reconcil faith antoin decid becom priest also help explain other teenag dont like footbal dont get fight dont girlfriend said smile document publish vatican ban ordin homosexu priest halt plan chose enter monasteri place thought chastiti would easier temptat less preval stay time start embrac love life leav like antoin mani french peopl struggl reconcil cathol faith ident member lgbtq commun although mani parish clergi strive inclus sensit issu homosexu still consid problemat within church less conserv predecessor benedict xvi john paul pope franci repeatedli express desir creat inclus church current issu surfac synod synod import meet futur institut held octob rome work document major assembl rais question concret measur reach peopl feel exclud church affect sexual exampl remarri divorce peopl live polygam marriag lgbtq peopl etc specif concern question bless homosexu coupl request made mani believ oppos conserv element church believ effect amount institut recogn lifestyl deem disord cathol teach attract person sex sin sexual act practic marri life consid sin thu fulfil life faith one orient seem challeng believ oppos church point view suppress feel desir inner moral suffer loss confid self esteem guilt anxieti mani lgbtq peopl feel exclud real place within institut sexual moral essenti revolv around heterosexu coupl dedic procreat french catholic fairli conserv issu compar germani belgium despit recent chang church perspect issu particularli legal sex marriag clergi real difficulti speak subject explain line raud sociologist ecol de haut etud scienc social
At least 14 French airports receive bomb threats,"    After a number of major French airports were evacuated on Wednesday, many more were the targets of bomb threats on Thursday, leading to at least eight being temporarily evacuated. ","At least 14 French airports received bomb threats on Thursday, October 19, with at least eight evacuated, in the latest series of false alarms that have rattled the country over the past week.Most of France's major airports – with the exception of its two biggest in Paris – were temporarily evacuated on Wednesday, leading to at least 130 flight cancellations.On Thursday, the evacuations were focused on small airports such as Brest, Carcassonne, Bordeaux and Montpellier.Aviation authority DGAC confirmed the bomb threats without giving a precise number, while several airports put out social media messages about the evacuations and checks by security forces.France, which has large Jewish and Muslim populations, has been on high alert since Hamas's assault on Israel and since a teacher was killed last week by an attacker who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State extremist group.""It's a serious nuisance, but we take zero risks,"" said a spokesperson for Bordeaux-Merignac Airport, which had already seen a three-hour evacuation on Wednesday that led to a dozen flights being canceled.Transport Minister Clement Beaune wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday that ""planned false alerts are dangerous and unacceptable,"" adding that offenders risk two years in prison and a €30,000 fine.The Louvre Museum and Palace of Versailles have also received threats in recent days, leading to temporary closures.",Global-issues,least french airports received bomb threats thursday october least eight evacuated latest series false alarms rattled country past week frances major airports exception two biggest paris temporarily evacuated wednesday leading least flight cancellations thursday evacuations focused small airports brest carcassonne bordeaux montpellier aviation authority dgac confirmed bomb threats without giving precise number several airports put social media messages evacuations checks security forces france large jewish muslim populations high alert since hamass assault israel since teacher killed last week attacker sworn allegiance islamic state extremist group serious nuisance take zero risks said spokesperson bordeaux merignac airport already seen three hour evacuation wednesday led dozen flights canceled transport minister clement beaune wrote formerly twitter wednesday planned false alerts dangerous unacceptable adding offenders risk two years prison fine louvre museum palace versailles also received threats recent days leading temporary closures,least french airport receiv bomb threat thursday octob least eight evacu latest seri fals alarm rattl countri past week franc major airport except two biggest pari temporarili evacu wednesday lead least flight cancel thursday evacu focus small airport brest carcassonn bordeaux montpelli aviat author dgac confirm bomb threat without give precis number sever airport put social media messag evacu check secur forc franc larg jewish muslim popul high alert sinc hamass assault israel sinc teacher kill last week attack sworn allegi islam state extremist group seriou nuisanc take zero risk said spokesperson bordeaux merignac airport alreadi seen three hour evacu wednesday led dozen flight cancel transport minist clement beaun wrote formerli twitter wednesday plan fals alert danger unaccept ad offend risk two year prison fine louvr museum palac versail also receiv threat recent day lead temporari closur
India's Supreme Court declines to legalize same-sex marriage,"    The judges felt they had no authority to rule on the matter, leaving it to Parliament to legislate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is hostile to such legislation, which he believes would threaten 'the values accepted by society.' ","Same-sex marriage will not be allowed in India. On Tuesday, October 17, the Indian Supreme Court rejected the applications of 21 petitioners, including same-sex couples, trans people and associations. The judges considered that they were not empowered to make such a decision and referred this responsibility to Parliament, as the government had wanted.The hopes of the LGBT+ community were high, as India's highest court had issued a landmark ruling in 2018 decriminalizing homosexuality. The only notable progress concerned marriage for couples where one of the members is transgender. The Supreme Court considered that there is no obstacle to transsexual people entering into marriage, provided they are identified as a ""man"" and a ""woman"" respectively.It is unlikely that Modi's government will be tempted to legislate, as the judges are urging. During hearings in April and May, the prime minister's representative had expressed his hostility to same-sex marriage in the name of the unity of the family, arguing that this consisted of a husband, a wife and children. ""Any interference in this area (...) would completely upset the delicate balance of laws relating to the individual in the country and the values accepted by society,"" he claimed.""I doubt that the BJP [ Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party] would even want the issue to be debated in Parliament, let alone passed into law,"" commented Shashi Tharoor, an MP for Congress, the main opposition party, speaking after the decision.However, the debates before the high court had been of high quality in a rather calm atmosphere, very different from the demonstrations that had accompanied the adoption of the same-sex marriage law in France.The five judges who reviewed the applications were divided. They each read out their position before announcing a joint decision. While the petitioners demanded that LGBT+ couples be granted the same rights as heterosexual families in terms of adoption, insurance and inheritance, on the basis of the principle of equality of citizens, Chief Justice Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud argued that there is no fundamental right to marriage. However, he insisted on the country's duty to grant some form of recognition to same-sex relationships, and to protect them against all forms of discrimination. ""I didn't expect the judgment to be very good, but it's much worse than I expected,"" said Uday Raj Anand, one of the petitioners.Despite the decriminalization of homosexuality in India, the lives of couples remain exposed to family and social violence. With the recognition of marriage, petitioners and militant associations hoped to strengthen their protection.",Global-issues,sex marriage allowed india tuesday october indian supreme court rejected applications petitioners including sex couples trans people associations judges considered empowered make decision referred responsibility parliament government wanted hopes lgbt community high indias highest court issued landmark ruling decriminalizing homosexuality notable progress concerned marriage couples one members transgender supreme court considered obstacle transsexual people entering marriage provided identified man woman respectively unlikely modis government tempted legislate judges urging hearings april may prime ministers representative expressed hostility sex marriage name unity family arguing consisted husband wife children interference area would completely upset delicate balance laws relating individual country values accepted society claimed doubt bjp modis bharatiya janata party would even want issue debated parliament let alone passed law commented shashi tharoor congress main opposition party speaking decision however debates high court high quality rather calm atmosphere different demonstrations accompanied adoption sex marriage law france five judges reviewed applications divided read position announcing joint decision petitioners demanded lgbt couples granted rights heterosexual families terms adoption insurance inheritance basis principle equality citizens chief justice dhananjaya yeshwant chandrachud argued fundamental right marriage however insisted countrys duty grant form recognition sex relationships protect forms discrimination didnt expect judgment good much worse expected said uday raj anand one petitioners despite decriminalization homosexuality india lives couples remain exposed family social violence recognition marriage petitioners militant associations hoped strengthen protection,sex marriag allow india tuesday octob indian suprem court reject applic petition includ sex coupl tran peopl associ judg consid empow make decis refer respons parliament govern want hope lgbt commun high india highest court issu landmark rule decrimin homosexu notabl progress concern marriag coupl one member transgend suprem court consid obstacl transsexu peopl enter marriag provid identifi man woman respect unlik modi govern tempt legisl judg urg hear april may prime minist repres express hostil sex marriag name uniti famili argu consist husband wife children interfer area would complet upset delic balanc law relat individu countri valu accept societi claim doubt bjp modi bharatiya janata parti would even want issu debat parliament let alon pass law comment shashi tharoor congress main opposit parti speak decis howev debat high court high qualiti rather calm atmospher differ demonstr accompani adopt sex marriag law franc five judg review applic divid read posit announc joint decis petition demand lgbt coupl grant right heterosexu famili term adopt insur inherit basi principl equal citizen chief justic dhananjaya yeshwant chandrachud argu fundament right marriag howev insist countri duti grant form recognit sex relationship protect form discrimin didnt expect judgment good much wors expect said uday raj anand one petition despit decrimin homosexu india live coupl remain expos famili social violenc recognit marriag petition milit associ hope strengthen protect
Mexico: Three separate armed attacks leave 24 dead,"    In an 'extraordinary' outbreak of pre-electoral violence, the attacks in western and central Mexico targeted a security patrol, the brother of a mayor, and rival drug dealers. ","Three separate armed attacks in Mexico on Monday left at least 24 people dead, including a dozen police officers, authorities said about the latest violence to hit regions plagued by drug trafficking.In the deadliest incident, unidentified attackers targeted a security patrol in Guerrero state's municipality of Coyuca de Benitez, prosecutor Alejandro Hernandez said. At least 13 people were killed and two others wounded in that attack, the state prosecutor's office said in a statement, with Hernandez earlier having confirmed that at least 11 of those killed were members of the municipal police force.A senior state security official was traveling in the convoy when it was attacked, authorities said, without confirming media reports that he was murdered along with police bodyguards. Security forces were later seen patrolling the area – where several lifeless bodies lay on the ground – as a police helicopter flew overhead.Another attack, in the neighboring western state of Michoacan, left five people dead and two more injured, authorities said. A group of gunmen attacked the brother of the mayor of the town of Tacambaro, according to the state prosecutor's office. A restaurant worker and a member of the police force were among those killed, while the mayor's brother was wounded, it said. In a video posted on social media, gunmen were seen opening fire before fleeing in several vehicles.A third attack on Monday, a gunfight between alleged drug dealers in the central Mexican state of Puebla, left at least six dead and two wounded, the regional government reported. The incident took place in the rural community of San Miguel Canoa, about 120 kilometers from Mexico City.Mexico is plagued by cartel-related bloodshed that has seen more than 420,000 people murdered since the government deployed the military in its war on drugs in 2006. Since then, the country's murder rate has tripled to 25 per 100,000 inhabitants. Mexico has also registered more than 110,000 disappearances since 1962, most attributed to criminal organizations.Guerrero and Michoacan are among the country's most violent areas, due to confrontations between rival drug traffickers and security forces. Although it is home to the famed coastal resort of Acapulco, Guerrero is one of Mexico's poorest states.Violence – particularly targeting low-level officials – often escalates across the country in the run-up to elections. Presidential and parliamentary polls are set to be held next year.Even so, experts said the latest wave of violence was particularly shocking. ""Guerrero has long seen one of Mexico's most complicated armed conflicts, but the current, pre-electoral levels of violence are extraordinary,"" Falko Ernst, an analyst at International Crisis Group, wrote on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.Since taking office in 2018, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has championed a ""hugs not bullets"" strategy to tackle violent crime at its roots by fighting poverty and inequality with social programs, rather than with the army.",Global-issues,three separate armed attacks mexico monday left least people dead including dozen police officers authorities said latest violence hit regions plagued drug trafficking deadliest incident unidentified attackers targeted security patrol guerrero states municipality coyuca benitez prosecutor alejandro hernandez said least people killed two others wounded attack state prosecutors office said statement hernandez earlier confirmed least killed members municipal police force senior state security official traveling convoy attacked authorities said without confirming media reports murdered along police bodyguards security forces later seen patrolling area several lifeless bodies lay ground police helicopter flew overhead another attack neighboring western state michoacan left five people dead two injured authorities said group gunmen attacked brother mayor town tacambaro according state prosecutors office restaurant worker member police force among killed mayors brother wounded said video posted social media gunmen seen opening fire fleeing several vehicles third attack monday gunfight alleged drug dealers central mexican state puebla left least six dead two wounded regional government reported incident took place rural community san miguel canoa kilometers mexico city mexico plagued cartel related bloodshed seen people murdered since government deployed military war drugs since countrys murder rate tripled per inhabitants mexico also registered disappearances since attributed criminal organizations guerrero michoacan among countrys violent areas due confrontations rival drug traffickers security forces although home famed coastal resort acapulco guerrero one mexicos poorest states violence particularly targeting low level officials often escalates across country run elections presidential parliamentary polls set held next year even experts said latest wave violence particularly shocking guerrero long seen one mexicos complicated armed conflicts current pre electoral levels violence extraordinary falko ernst analyst international crisis group wrote social media platform formerly twitter since taking office president andres manuel lopez obrador championed hugs bullets strategy tackle violent crime roots fighting poverty inequality social programs rather army,three separ arm attack mexico monday left least peopl dead includ dozen polic offic author said latest violenc hit region plagu drug traffick deadliest incid unidentifi attack target secur patrol guerrero state municip coyuca benitez prosecutor alejandro hernandez said least peopl kill two other wound attack state prosecutor offic said statement hernandez earlier confirm least kill member municip polic forc senior state secur offici travel convoy attack author said without confirm media report murder along polic bodyguard secur forc later seen patrol area sever lifeless bodi lay ground polic helicopt flew overhead anoth attack neighbor western state michoacan left five peopl dead two injur author said group gunmen attack brother mayor town tacambaro accord state prosecutor offic restaur worker member polic forc among kill mayor brother wound said video post social media gunmen seen open fire flee sever vehicl third attack monday gunfight alleg drug dealer central mexican state puebla left least six dead two wound region govern report incid took place rural commun san miguel canoa kilomet mexico citi mexico plagu cartel relat bloodsh seen peopl murder sinc govern deploy militari war drug sinc countri murder rate tripl per inhabit mexico also regist disappear sinc attribut crimin organ guerrero michoacan among countri violent area due confront rival drug traffick secur forc although home fame coastal resort acapulco guerrero one mexico poorest state violenc particularli target low level offici often escal across countri run elect presidenti parliamentari poll set held next year even expert said latest wave violenc particularli shock guerrero long seen one mexico complic arm conflict current pre elector level violenc extraordinari falko ernst analyst intern crisi group wrote social media platform formerli twitter sinc take offic presid andr manuel lopez obrador champion hug bullet strategi tackl violent crime root fight poverti inequ social program rather armi
EU awards major Freedom of Thought prize to Mahsa Amini,"    22-year-old Mahsa Amini, the Iranian Kurdish woman whose death in Iranian custody a year ago triggered mass protests in Iran, and also a global movement known as 'Woman, Life, Freedom', received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. ","The European Union on Thursday, October 19, awarded its top human rights honor, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, to Mahsa Amini, the Iranian Kurdish woman who died in Iranian custody a year ago, and the ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" movement her death triggered.""The brutal murder of 22-year-old Jina Mahsa Amini marked a turning point. It has triggered a women-led movement that is making history,"" European Parliament speaker Roberta Metsola said, using Amini's Kurdish first name as she announced the award. Metsola said the movement's three-word slogan was ""a rallying cry for all those standing up for equality, for dignity, and for freedom in Iran"". The EU prize announcement comes two weeks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to an imprisoned Iranian rights campaigner, Narges Mohammadi.Amini died at age 22 on September 16, 2022, while being held by Iran's religious police for allegedly breaching the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women. Her family and supporters say she was killed. Iranian authorities claim she died in custody from a previously undisclosed medical condition.Her death triggered mass protests in Iran. It also generated a global movement known as ""Woman, Life, Freedom"", calling for the end of Iran's imposition of a headscarf on all women and an end to the Muslim cleric-led government in Tehran.Iranian security forces have cracked down on the protests domestically, killing hundreds, and have executed dozens for allegedly participating in what officials have called ""riots"". This week, they jailed Amini's lawyer, Saleh Nikbakht, for one year for ""propaganda"" after he spoke to the media about her case.Many Iranian women continue to defy the government's clothing edict by taking off their headscarves in public. The ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" campaign continues in cities around the world, with frequent demonstrations in which Amini's photo is held aloft.Mohammadi's Nobel Peace Prize was in recognition of her fight against the mandatory headscarf in Iran and against the oppression of women in the country. Together, the two prizes focus attention on Iranian authorities' punishment of women who defy the headscarf order, seen by both sides as defiance of the Islamic Republic's system of governance itself.Amini and the ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" movement were backed by the European Parliament's three main political groups, making them the frontrunner well before the Sakharov Prize winner was announced.The two other nominations on the shortlist, backed by smaller groups, were Nicaraguan rights defenders, Vilma Nunez de Escorcia and Bishop Rolando Jose Alvarez Lagos; and three women campaigning for abortion rights, Justyna Wydrzynska from Poland, Morena Herrera from Salvador and Colleen McNicholas from the United States.

","Over 200,000 minors are estimated to have been sexually abused in Spain by the Roman Catholic clergy since 1940, according to an independent commission published on Friday, October 27.The report did not give a specific figure but said a poll of over 8,000 people found that 0.6% of Spain's adult population of around 39 million people said they had suffered sexual abuse by members of the clergy when they were still children.The percentage rises to 1.13% – or over 400,000 people – when including abuse by lay members, Spain's national ombudsman Ángel Gabilondo told a news conference called to present the findings of the report which has over 700 pages.The revelations in Spain are the latest to rock the Roman Catholic Church after a series of sexual abuse scandals around the world, often involving children, over the past 20 years.The commission also interviewed 487 victims, who stressed ""the emotional problems"" the abuse has caused them, Gabilondo said. ""There are people who have (died by) suicide... people who have never put their lives back together,"" the former Socialist education minister said.Teresa Conde, a philosophy teacher who was abused for years by a friar starting at the age of 14 when she attended a religious school in the northwestern city of Salamanca in the early 1980, said she is ""never going to be a normal person."" ""I'm never going to stop doing therapy or taking medicine,"" the 57-year-old told Agence France-Presse (AFP).Unlike in other nations, in Spain – a traditionally Catholic country that has become highly secular – clerical abuse allegations only recently started to gain traction, leading to accusations by survivors of stonewalling.The report is critical of the response of the Catholic Church, saying ""it has long been characterized by denial and attempts to downplay the issue."" It recommended the creation of a state fund to pay reparations to victims.""Unfortunately, for many years there has been a certain desire to deny abuses or a desire to conceal or protect the abusers,"" said Gabilondo.Spain's parliament in March 2022 overwhelmingly approved the creation of an independent commission led by the country's ombudsman to look into clerical abuse.The country's Catholic Church, which for years flatly refused to carry out its own probe, declined to take part in the probe, although it did cooperate by providing documents on cases of sexual abuse that had been collected by dioceses.But as political pressure mounted, it tasked a private law firm in February 2022 with an ""audit"" into past and present sexual abuse by clergy, teachers and others associated with the Church, which should be completed by the end of the year.The Spanish church has also set up protocols for dealing with sexual abuse and has set up ""child protection"" offices within dioceses.Contacted by AFP, the Spanish bishops' conference said it would react to the commission's report on Monday at an extraordinary meeting.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the release of the report was a ""milestone"" in the country's democratic history. ""Today we are a slightly better country, because a reality that everyone was for years aware of but no one talked about, has been made known,"" the Socialist premier told reporters in Brussels.Juan Cuatrecasas, a founding member of the ""Infancia Robada"" (Stolen Childhood) victims' association and the father of a youth who was abused by a teacher at a Catholic school in Bilbao, said lawmakers now must ensure repairs are made. ""This must be the start of something, not an end in itself,"" he told AFP.The Roman Catholic Church's abuse crisis exploded onto the international stage in 2002 when the Boston Globe newspaper revealed priests had sexually abused children for decades and church leaders had covered it up.Patterns of widespread abuse of children were later reported across the United States and Europe, in Chile and Australia, undercutting the moral authority of the 1.3 billion-member Church and taking a toll on its membership.An independent commission in France for example concluded in 2021 that some 216,000 children – mostly boys – had been sexually abused by clergy since 1950.",Global-issues,minors estimated sexually abused spain roman catholic clergy since according independent commission

Putin revokes Russia's ratification of nuclear test ban treaty,"    The Russian president signed a law withdrawing Russia's ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which has never come into force as China, the US and 6 others never ratified it. ","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday signed a law revoking Russia's ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The 1996 treaty outlaws all nuclear explosions, including live tests of nuclear weapons, though it never came into force because some key countries – including the United States and China – never ratified it.The West has accused Russia of using reckless nuclear rhetoric since it launched its offensive on Ukraine last February. Putin last week oversaw ballistic missile drills in what Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said was practice for a ""massive"" retaliatory nuclear strike against an unnamed enemy. Putin also said last month he was ""not ready to say"" whether Russia would carry out live nuclear tests.The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) has urged Russia to continue its commitment to the treaty, including the operation on its territory of monitoring stations capable of detecting the slightest explosion in real-time. ""Today's decision by the Russian Federation to revoke its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is very disappointing and deeply regrettable,"" CTBTO head Robert Floyd said on X, formerly known as Twitter.The bill to revoke the treaty passed through Russia's parliament last month in a fast-track process. During parliamentary hearings, State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said the move to revoke the treaty was a response to the United States' ""cynicism"" and ""boorish attitudes"" on nuclear weapons.Although it never entered into force, the agreement was ratified by 178 countries, including nuclear powers France and Britain, and has symbolic value. Its backers say it established an international norm against live tests of nuclear weapons, but critics say the potential of the deal remains unrealized without the ratification of major nuclear powers.

Iran sentences woman to death for adultery,"    Iran faces global scrutiny for its frequent use of the death penalty. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday said that Iran has executed 419 individuals in the first seven months of this year, marking a 30% increase from the previous year. ","An Iranian court has sentenced a woman to death for adultery, state media said. A report by the IRAN newspaper on Wednesday, November 1, said the woman worked as a trainer in a gym for females. It said her husband contacted police in 2022 when he found her with another man at their home. The husband discovered from surveillance cameras that she was having relations with other men, the report added. Under Iranian law, she can appeal the sentence.Iranian courts sometimes sentence people to death by stoning for adultery, which can be reduced to lighter punishments upon appeal. Iran is under international pressure for its extensive use of the death penalty. On Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Iran was executing people at ""an alarming rate."" He said at least 419 people received capital punishment in the first seven months of this year, an increase of 30% from the same period last year.In 2017, a court sentenced a woman to death for adultery but there has been no report of her execution since then.

Iranian teenager dies in suspicious circumstances reminiscent of Mahsa Amini's death,"    Attacked in the metro for not wearing a headscarf, 17-year-old Armita Geravand died on Saturday after several weeks in a coma. The regime denies the incident. Her funeral led to several arrests. ","Armita Geravand was 17. She loved Korean pop music, took part in taekwondo and enjoyed painting. She was attacked on October 1 in the Teheran metro by women working for the Iranian regime because she was not wearing a headscarf. After four weeks in a coma, the teenager died on Saturday, October 28, in a Tehran hospital. She was buried on Sunday in the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in the south of the city, in the presence of numerous plainclothes security forces.At her funeral, a dozen people were arrested, including the well-known Iranian lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, the 2012 winner of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The Iranian authorities deny any responsibility for Geravand's death, alleging that she hit her head on the floor after fainting due to a fall in blood pressure.The girl's death tragically echoes that of Mahsa (Jina) Amini, who died on September 16, 2022. Beaten in police custody because of her ""improperly worn"" headscarf, she too fell into a coma. When her death was announced, Iran was overwhelmed by a wave of protests of unprecedented scope and duration.For months, Iranians across the country took to the streets to vent their anger at the Islamic Republic government. More than 500 people were killed, including dozens of children. Even today, Iranian women go out into the streets without headscarves to denounce this compulsory requirement. They risk harassment, arrest, fines, confiscation of their cars and dismissal from their jobs.In recent weeks, Iranians have reported the presence of plainclothes agents, particularly in subway stations, who attack women deemed ""not properly covered."" According to sources quoted by BBC Persian, Geravand was jostled by a group of ""hejabban"" (""hijab supervisors"" in Persian) because she was not wearing her headscarf, which had fallen over her shoulders. Her head then hit a metal bar in a train car. The Iranian authorities deny this version of events. They have published images recorded by surveillance cameras in the station, but none from inside the carriage where the incident happened.The girl's parents and friends were interviewed several times by Iranian state television, a propaganda tool, repeating the version put forward by the regime. However, some Iranians, pointing to the desperate look on the faces of those interviewed and their disorganized speech, believe that the girl's relatives were forced to say these things.

Macron plans to make abortion an 'irreversible' constitutional right in France,"    In an online post on Sunday, the French president said, 'In 2024, the right of women to choose abortion will become irreversible.' ","French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday, October 29, his government plans to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution to make them ""irreversible"".In an online post, Macron said a draft project would be submitted to the State Council, France's highest administrative court, this coming week, with a view to making abortion rights constitutional by the end of the year. ""In 2024, the right of women to choose abortion will become irreversible,"" he said.The announcement follows a promise Macron made on March 8, International Women's Day, which was seen as a response to the overturning of federal abortion rights in the United States last year.Constitutional revision in France requires either a referendum or approval by at least three-fifths of the members of both chambers of parliament united in a congress. Most constitutional changes in post-war France have been approved by congressional vote.The termination of a pregnancy was decriminalized in France in 1975 and successive laws have since aimed at improving conditions for abortions, notably by protecting the health and anonymity of women, as well as reducing the financial burden of the procedure on women.A November 2022 opinion poll found that 89 percent of respondents were in favor of making abortion rights constitutional.

Pope Francis attempts to instill a new culture in the Catholic Church,"    At the end of the synod intended by the pontiff to be an assembly at the service of everyone, a report was drawn up which raises the possibility of ordaining women deacons. ","Liturgy does not tolerate equality. On Sunday morning, October 29, at the closing Mass of the first assembly of the Synod on Synodality, the great meeting called by Pope Francis to reflect on the future of the Catholic Church, everyone once again took their rightful place in Rome's Saint Peter's Basilica: cardinals dressed in green chasubles in first place, then bishops, also in green, and finally the laity. But for four weeks, from October 4 to 29, they sat side by side at round tables set up for the occasion in Paul VI Hall, to discuss possible changes in the governance of the Catholic Church.In this way, the assembly visually embodied the change in culture sought by a pope eager to see the faithful participate more actively in the government of the institution. For the first time in history, the assembly even included women. 54 out of 365 were able to vote. On the menu for these four weeks of discussions, which many found a little long, based on questions raised by the faithful from around the world who were interviewed for the occasion: the place of women in the Catholic Church, the inclusion of LGBTQ people, the excessive role of clerics, and the fight against sexual abuse and violence.On Saturday evening, the assembly, which was only the first - the next, which should be conclusive, will take place in October 2024 - delivered the summary report of its work in Italian. The text, admittedly provisional, contains no definitive recommendations, but instead puts forward suggestions and leaves open questions presented as ""issues to be addressed."" Unsurprisingly, the place of women in the Catholic Church, which all the faithful spoke about to a greater or lesser extent in their pre-synod feedback, figured prominently.The discussions focused in particular on the possibility of ordaining women deacons, those ministers of religion whose role is to assist priests in their liturgical duties. Although the chapter devoted to this question was adopted on Saturday, like the rest of the text presented, it was also the one that received the most negative votes, a sign of the still strong differences of opinion among the prelates on the desirability of giving more room to women, who represent half of the 1.3 billion Catholics. For ""some,"" it said, ""such a step would be unacceptable because it would break with tradition.""Another obvious point of division is the issue of homosexuality. While the acronym LGBTQ originally appeared in the working document, it had completely disappeared from the final synthesis in favor of ""gender identity"" and ""sexual orientation."" The chapter that timidly evokes a more inclusive church on this subject also met with more opposition than the others. On Saturday, American Jesuit James Martin, a leading defender of the LGBTQ community in the church and a member of the synod's general assembly, made no secret of his disappointment. ""There were widely diverging views on the topic. I wish, however, that some of those discussions, which were frank and open, had been captured in the final synthesis,"" he told the American website National Catholic Reporter.",Global-issues,liturgy tolerate equality sunday morning october closing mass first assembly synod synodality great meeting called pope francis reflect future catholic church everyone took rightful place romes saint peters basilica cardinals dressed green chasubles first place bishops also green finally laity four weeks october sat side side round tables set occasion paul hall discuss possible changes governance catholic church way assembly visually embodied change culture sought pope eager see faithful participate actively government institution first time history assembly even included women able vote menu four weeks discussions many found little long based questions raised faithful around world interviewed occasion place women catholic church inclusion lgbtq people excessive role clerics fight sexual abuse violence saturday evening assembly first next conclusive take place october delivered summary report work italian text admittedly provisional contains definitive recommendations instead puts forward suggestions leaves open questions presented issues addressed unsurprisingly place women catholic church faithful spoke greater lesser extent pre synod feedback figured prominently discussions focused particular possibility ordaining women deacons ministers religion whose role assist priests liturgical duties although chapter devoted question adopted saturday like rest text presented also one received negative votes sign still strong differences opinion among prelates desirability giving room women represent half billion catholics said step would unacceptable would break tradition another obvious point division issue homosexuality acronym lgbtq originally appeared working document completely disappeared final synthesis favor gender identity sexual orientation chapter timidly evokes inclusive church subject also met opposition others saturday american jesuit james martin leading defender lgbtq community church member synods general assembly made secret disappointment widely diverging views topic wish however discussions frank open captured final synthesis told american website national catholic reporter,liturgi toler equal sunday morn octob close mass first assembl synod synod great meet call pope franci reflect futur cathol church everyon took right place rome saint peter basilica cardin dress green chasubl first place bishop also green final laiti four week octob sat side side round tabl set occas paul hall discuss possibl chang govern cathol church way assembl visual embodi chang cultur sought pope eager see faith particip activ govern institut first time histori assembl even includ women abl vote menu four week discuss mani found littl long base question rais faith around world interview occas place women cathol church inclus lgbtq peopl excess role cleric fight sexual abus violenc saturday even assembl first next conclus take place octob deliv summari report work italian text admittedli provision contain definit recommend instead put forward suggest leav open question present issu address unsurprisingli place women cathol church faith spoke greater lesser extent pre synod feedback figur promin discuss focus particular possibl ordain women deacon minist religion whose role assist priest liturg duti although chapter devot question adopt saturday like rest text present also one receiv neg vote sign still strong differ opinion among prelat desir give room women repres half billion cathol said step would unaccept would break tradit anoth obviou point divis issu homosexu acronym lgbtq origin appear work document complet disappear final synthesi favor gender ident sexual orient chapter timidli evok inclus church subject also met opposit other saturday american jesuit jame martin lead defend lgbtq commun church member synod gener assembl made secret disappoint wide diverg view topic wish howev discuss frank open captur final synthesi told american websit nation cathol report
Five restaurants in Lille that pack a punch,"    'Le Monde' presents five places in the northern French city that break with convention, and are sure to make your tastebuds happy. ","For the past 10 years, a new generation of inspired chefs has been thwarting convention and clichés. Beyond dishes such as Welsh rarebit and sugar tarts, they have reclaimed a rich history that extends to the Dunkirk coast.With its 10 stalls over two floors, the Grand'Scène food court has put the Rue de Béthune back on Lille's food map. Le Monde's favorite counter? Ataya: The king of falafel (€9) who has already put a bit of northern French style in his Syrian recipes, like his falafaluche (falafels served in faluche, a brioche-style bread) and ch'tiwarma (chawarma with Maroilles cheese).In spite of its somewhat canteen-style décor, behind its beautiful glass façade, Suzanne hides one of the most promising tables in the city with menus starting at €24 that have nothing to envy those of more upscale restaurants. Lucas Tricot dares to do almost everything: egg yolk used like bottarga (dried, smoked and grated) and veal tartar with smoked eel. Boldness, more boldness, always boldness.At only 27 years old, Damien Laforce has already done a lot of work, notably with on the sets of French cooking competition show Top Chef. He impresses the most when he emancipates himself cooking game. Melting venison with blood sauce, hare à la royale, braised wild boar shoulder: The young hunter aims at greediness and sharing, and hits the bull's eye. Lunchtime set menus start at €25.The reed bends but does not break. Diego Delbecq and Camille Pailleau have been through the tumult of the great restaurants, but have never given up. Now independent, their cooking is virtuoso: eel tartlet, oyster paired with veal and kimchi, pavlova with quince and Timut pepper. There is surely a star on the horizon. Menus from €37.At Brique Land, the North takes on an American accent.

Seven charming places to stay in rural France,Selection,"At the entrance to the Parc National du Mercantour, facing the Bois-Noir mountain, the Auberge de la Roche overlooks the Vallée de la Tinée, between Nice and the Auron and Isola 2000 ski resorts. Up there, at an altitude of 1,000 meters, the air is pure and the silence is barely disturbed by the village bells. Louis-Philippe Riel and Mickaëlle Chabat, a couple in their 30s from Paris, have teamed up with chef Alexis Bijaoui, who looks after the vegetable garden (he studied with chef and vegetable connoisseur Alain Passard). At this inn, you can choose one of its two bedrooms or three suites, furnished with objects lovingly found by Chabat. You'll also dine on leeks, squash, celeriac and Jerusalem artichokes, which feature in dishes throughout the winter. The restaurant buys from local and organic producers to compose menus where vegetables sits alongside roasted pig or majestic tuna, among other things. Enjoy food and a view that you'll not forget in a hurry.His Parisian restaurant was called Orties. But Thomas Benady fled the capital to pursue his botanical predilection near Mont-Saint-Michel. Now he is a wild picker and collects samphire, obione and purslane along the beaches, picks blackberries and mushrooms on the paths and hunts down abandoned orchards, which often provide apples and sometimes kiwis. His Auberge Sauvage is a tastefully renovated 16th century presbytery. The garden, self-sufficient in herbs (such as basil, coriander, cumin, caraway and lovage), provides all kinds of vegetables and will soon produce fruit – six trees have been planted. Around a large table d'hôte or smaller round tables, the unique menu is, of course, mostly plant-based and sometimes vegetarian, although the chef is not one to turn down salt-meadow lamb or Channel lobster. As for the three elegant rooms, they are named Melissa, Passionflower and Hogweed, a plant known for its soothing properties.In this delightful 17th century hamlet nestled in the Perche, there are five houses that form D'une Ile, where you can both stay and eat (a simple snack is prepared for lunch). The founders of the Septime restaurant Bertrand Grébaut and Théo Pourriat infused some of the savory, bistronomic spirit of their Parisian restaurant, when they bought the place in 2018. Olive oil is off-limits, since they only cook with local products (including rapeseed oil, which is just as good for your health). With a revamped, chic countryside vibe, the 10 rooms can accommodate up to 26 people, and the new ""super suite"" includes three bedrooms and a kitchenette, making it an ideal retreat for a (small) wedding or birthday party. Of course, you can go out and scour the countryside around the estate, which spans eight hectares of hills, forests and paths to wander.

France will turn excess wine into industrial alcohol to combat surplus,    The world's second-largest wine producer is dealing with both overproduction and a drop in consumption. ,"France plans to spend millions of euros to turn wine into industrial alcohol for pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to drain a massive surplus, the Agriculture Ministry said on Monday, February 6.The world's second-largest wine producer after Italy, France has long been known as a nation of wine aficionados. But growers in the southwest region of Bordeaux say overproduction and a drop in domestic consumption of their more affordable brands have filled up their cellars and left them with nowhere to store the fruits of their next harvest.The Agriculture Ministry said that it would spend up to €160 million ($170 million) on distilling the tipple into industrial alcohol to use up some of the backlog.In Bordeaux, winemaker Didier Cousiney said the amount was only enough to help each small business for just a couple of months when spread across the industry nationwide.We have ""24 months' worth of backlog in our cellars,"" he said.Agriculture unions in the Bordeaux region, which have staged several protests, instead want compensation in exchange for uprooting part of their vineyards, a practice known as ""grubbing up"" the land. This would help reduce production and allow wine growers to repurpose the land for other activities.Cousiney and fellow growers estimate that at least 15,000 hectares (37,000 acres) of vineyards – an area equivalent to 21,000 football pitches – need to be grubbed up across the region to make a difference. They are requesting compensation of €10,000 per hectare.The government last sponsored distillation in 2020, after the worldwide Covid-19 lockdowns caused restaurants and bars to close down, and French wine exports to drop.Around half a million people are estimated to work in the wine industry in France, according to the National Interprofessional Wine Commission. If nothing is done, ""we fear between 100,000 and 150,000 jobs will be threatened in the coming decade,"" the commission's head, Bernard Farges, warned in December.Red wine sales in French supermarkets dropped 15% last year, according to the country's General Association for Wine Production. White and rose wine were less affected, registering declines of around 3% and 4%.Jerome Despey, a winegrower and secretary general of the FNSEA agriculture union, said this reflected a broader trend. French people used to drink around 130 liters of wine on average a year 70 years ago, he said, but today that has dropped to around 40 liters.",Food,france plans spend millions euros turn wine industrial alcohol pharmaceuticals cosmetics drain massive surplus agriculture ministry said monday february worlds second largest wine producer italy france long known nation wine aficionados growers southwest region bordeaux say overproduction drop domestic consumption affordable brands filled cellars left nowhere store fruits next harvest agriculture ministry said would spend million million distilling tipple industrial alcohol use backlog bordeaux winemaker didier cousiney said amount enough help small business couple months spread across industry nationwide months worth backlog cellars said agriculture unions bordeaux region staged several protests instead want compensation exchange uprooting part vineyards practice known grubbing land would help reduce production allow wine growers repurpose land activities cousiney fellow growers estimate least hectares acres vineyards area equivalent football pitches need grubbed across region make difference requesting compensation per hectare government last sponsored distillation worldwide covid lockdowns caused restaurants bars close french wine exports drop around half million people estimated work wine industry france according national interprofessional wine commission nothing done fear jobs threatened coming decade commissions head bernard farges warned december red wine sales french supermarkets dropped last year according countrys general association wine production white rose wine less affected registering declines around jerome despey winegrower secretary general fnsea agriculture union said reflected broader trend french people used drink around liters wine average year years ago said today dropped around liters,franc plan spend million euro turn wine industri alcohol pharmaceut cosmet drain massiv surplu agricultur ministri said monday februari world second largest wine produc itali franc long known nation wine aficionado grower southwest region bordeaux say overproduct drop domest consumpt afford brand fill cellar left nowher store fruit next harvest agricultur ministri said would spend million million distil tippl industri alcohol use backlog bordeaux winemak didier cousiney said amount enough help small busi coupl month spread across industri nationwid month worth backlog cellar said agricultur union bordeaux region stage sever protest instead want compens exchang uproot part vineyard practic known grub land would help reduc product allow wine grower repurpos land activ cousiney fellow grower estim least hectar acr vineyard area equival footbal pitch need grub across region make differ request compens per hectar govern last sponsor distil worldwid covid lockdown caus restaur bar close french wine export drop around half million peopl estim work wine industri franc accord nation interprofession wine commiss noth done fear job threaten come decad commiss head bernard farg warn decemb red wine sale french supermarket drop last year accord countri gener associ wine product white rose wine less affect regist declin around jerom despey winegrow secretari gener fnsea agricultur union said reflect broader trend french peopl use drink around liter wine averag year year ago said today drop around liter
"Women and menopause: 'I realized that it could turn your life upside down, but no one was talking about it'","    With little or no information, many women find themselves at a loss when the first hot flashes arrive, almost by surprise. A fog persists around this pivotal moment in life, even though there are ways of getting through it better. ","When heat waves invaded Marthe's nights five years ago (some interviewees requested anonymity), no one warned her of the little living inferno she was about to enter, not to mention the fatigue, wrist and ankle pain, and weight gain that would follow. ""The doctor prescribed estrogen gel and progesterone capsules. It's a daily chore, constantly having to calculate when to take what. If you forget, the pain comes back with a vengeance. I felt like I was old and ugly before my time,"" explained this 51-year-old cultural executive in Paris.According to INSEE data for 2023, it is estimated that over 14 million women in France are affected by menopause. Every year, some 500,000 of them begin to experience it without being quite sure they can identify it. ""At first, I thought, with shame and irony, that I was pregnant,"" said 53-year-old Naïla, a teacher in Poitiers. Nearly one French woman in two feels that she is not sufficiently informed on the subject, according to a 2023 Essity study. Instead, she learns as she goes that menopause – the natural process that marks the cessation of ovarian function, and therefore the end of fertility – has arrived for good when menstruation has ceased for 12 months.""I thought I knew what to expect – the hot flashes, the intimate dryness, the low libido – but I never expected to be affected at the age of 44,"" confided Marie, now 45, a teacher in Lorraine. ""I've always been a dynamic person, but I feel like I had my battery removed. My brain is sluggish, it's hard to put two ideas together, my muscles are like cotton and my bones are made of lead. I feel like one of those old cassette players whose batteries were at the end of their life, with the music slowing down.""How do you cope with this ""second woman"" – mentioned by Gena Rowlands' character in John Cassavetes' Opening Night (1977) – when, just a few days earlier, you felt on top of the world, freed from the series of existential problems that had encumbered your 30s? ""It's like finding yourself facing eternity,"" said 44-year-old Louise, an architect in eastern France, who recently discovered the existence of the term ""perimenopause"": this pivotal period, which lasts an average of two to four years before menopause, can be accompanied by the so-called ""climacteric"" signs of aging.It's all a matter of bad timing. And suspense... It's Russian roulette: 87% of women experience at least one symptom in addition to the cessation of menstruation, 20% to 25% experience severe disorders (according to 2023 INSERM data), and it's commonly accepted that a third of them are not bothered too severely. Many women feel their way around menopause. For some, it's a ""bummer,"" an ""inner tsunami"" or  ""horrible;"" for others, it's a ""blessing,"" a ""mid-life liberation"" or a ""real joy,"" since they are happy to be out of their reproductive period. For some it's an ""awakening:"" ""I forced my body to change its paradigm and ignore all my aches and pains. I ran my first marathon at 55 and followed it up with six more,"" said 61-year-old Nathalie Si Amer enthusiastically, recently retired from teaching in the Paris region.",Global-issues,heat waves invaded marthes nights five years ago interviewees requested anonymity one warned little living inferno enter mention fatigue wrist ankle pain weight gain would follow doctor prescribed estrogen gel progesterone capsules daily chore constantly calculate take forget pain comes back vengeance felt like old ugly time explained year old cultural executive paris according insee data estimated million women france affected menopause every year begin experience without quite sure identify first thought shame irony pregnant said year old teacher poitiers nearly one french woman two feels sufficiently informed subject according essity study instead learns goes menopause natural process marks cessation ovarian function therefore end fertility arrived good menstruation ceased months thought knew expect hot flashes intimate dryness low libido never expected affected age confided marie teacher lorraine ive always dynamic person feel like battery removed brain sluggish hard put two ideas together muscles like cotton bones made lead feel like one old cassette players whose batteries end life music slowing cope second woman mentioned gena rowlands character john cassavetes opening night days earlier felt top world freed series existential problems encumbered like finding facing eternity said year old louise architect eastern france recently discovered existence term perimenopause pivotal period lasts average two four years menopause accompanied called climacteric signs aging matter bad timing suspense russian roulette women experience least one symptom addition cessation menstruation experience severe disorders according inserm data commonly accepted third bothered severely many women feel way around menopause bummer inner tsunami horrible others blessing mid life liberation real joy since happy reproductive period awakening forced body change paradigm ignore aches pains ran first marathon followed six said year old nathalie amer enthusiastically recently retired teaching paris region,heat wave invad marth night five year ago interviewe request anonym one warn littl live inferno enter mention fatigu wrist ankl pain weight gain would follow doctor prescrib estrogen gel progesteron capsul daili chore constantli calcul take forget pain come back vengeanc felt like old ugli time explain year old cultur execut pari accord inse data estim million women franc affect menopaus everi year begin experi without quit sure identifi first thought shame ironi pregnant said year old teacher poitier nearli one french woman two feel suffici inform subject accord essiti studi instead learn goe menopaus natur process mark cessat ovarian function therefor end fertil arriv good menstruat ceas month thought knew expect hot flash intim dryness low libido never expect affect age confid mari teacher lorrain ive alway dynam person feel like batteri remov brain sluggish hard put two idea togeth muscl like cotton bone made lead feel like one old cassett player whose batteri end life music slow cope second woman mention gena rowland charact john cassavet open night day earlier felt top world freed seri existenti problem encumb like find face etern said year old louis architect eastern franc recent discov exist term perimenopaus pivot period last averag two four year menopaus accompani call climacter sign age matter bad time suspens russian roulett women experi least one symptom addit cessat menstruat experi sever disord accord inserm data commonli accept third bother sever mani women feel way around menopaus bummer inner tsunami horribl other bless mid life liber real joy sinc happi reproduct period awaken forc bodi chang paradigm ignor ach pain ran first marathon follow six said year old nathali amer enthusiast recent retir teach pari region
Paris prosecutor opens investigation after Stars of David found tagged on buildings,"    Dozens of Stars of David were sprayed on buildings around the city and its suburbs, seen as threatening Jews amid the war between Israel and Hamas. ","Paris prosecutors opened an investigation on Tuesday, October 31, into 'some 60' Stars of David daubed on buildings in the 14th arrondissement of the capital, seen as threatening Jews amid the war between Israel and Hamas. The investigation for ""damage to other people's property aggravated by the fact that it was committed on the grounds of origin, race, ethnicity or religion"" has been entrusted to the Paris territorial police, the prosecutor's office said. This offense carries a maximum penalty of four years' imprisonment and a fine of €30,000.The prosecutor's office said it did not know ""whether these tags were intended to insult the Jewish people or to claim Jewish membership, particularly as they involved the blue star (not the yellow one)."" ""These stencils were marked on facades, in a way that was manifestly indifferent to what the buildings housed,"" says the public prosecutor. It has therefore not been established that this star has an anti-Semitic connotation, but this cannot be dismissed out of hand.""Earlier in the morning, the 14th arrondissement town hall had revealed that it had received ""several reports of stars of David stenciled on numerous walls"". ""This act of stenciling is reminiscent of the methods used in the 1930s and the Second World War, which led to the extermination of millions of Jews,"" wrote the municipality in a press release, denouncing ""anti-Semitic acts"". ""Anti-Semitism plastered on our streets as in the darkest hours"", also commented Carine Petit, the borough's mayor.Similar tags appeared last weekend in Paris suburbs including Vanves and Fontenay-aux-Roses (Hauts-de-Seine), as well as in Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen (Seine-Saint-Denis), where stencils were accompanied by inscriptions such as ""From the sea to the Jordan, Palestine will overcome"".""I firmly condemn these racist and anti-Semitic acts. The culprits must be arrested and judged with the utmost severity"", reacted the mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, on Monday. ""Anti-Semitism is a crime"", reiterated Aubervilliers Mayor Karine Franclet, who condemned the graffiti as ""despicable acts.""""On behalf of the government, I condemn these despicable acts with absolute firmness,"" reacted Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne at the French Assemblée Nationale on Tuesday. She said that ""to attack someone because they are Jewish (...) is to attack the very soul of the Republic"". ""It is the duty of the Republic to protect all the Jews of France"", she insisted, asserting that ""all those guilty of these acts must be questioned and condemned"" and that ""nothing can be tolerated, justified or excused.""Since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2,500 reports of anti-Semitic acts have been registered in France, according to the French Ministry of the Interior. On Sunday, the French Minister of Justice Eric Dupond-Moretti, reported more than 400 arrests for ""anti-Semitic acts.""",Global-issues,paris prosecutors opened investigation tuesday october stars david daubed buildings arrondissement capital seen threatening jews amid war israel hamas investigation damage peoples property aggravated fact committed grounds origin race ethnicity religion entrusted paris territorial police prosecutors office said offense carries maximum penalty four years imprisonment fine prosecutors office said know whether tags intended insult jewish people claim jewish membership particularly involved blue star yellow one stencils marked facades way manifestly indifferent buildings housed says public prosecutor therefore established star anti semitic connotation dismissed hand earlier morning arrondissement town hall revealed received several reports stars david stenciled numerous walls act stenciling reminiscent methods used second world war led extermination millions jews wrote municipality press release denouncing anti semitic acts anti semitism plastered streets darkest hours also commented carine petit boroughs mayor similar tags appeared last weekend paris suburbs including vanves fontenay aux roses hauts seine well aubervilliers saint ouen seine saint denis stencils accompanied inscriptions sea jordan palestine overcome firmly condemn racist anti semitic acts culprits must arrested judged utmost severity reacted mayor saint ouen karim bouamrane monday anti semitism crime reiterated aubervilliers mayor karine franclet condemned graffiti des acts behalf government condemn des acts absolute firmness reacted prime minister elisabeth borne french assembl nationale tuesday said attack someone jewish attack soul republic duty republic protect jews france insisted asserting guilty acts must questioned condemned nothing tolerated justified excused since hamas attack israel october reports anti semitic acts registered france according french ministry interior sunday french minister justice eric dupond moretti reported arrests anti semitic acts,pari prosecutor open investig tuesday octob star david daub build arrondiss capit seen threaten jew amid war israel hama investig damag peopl properti aggrav fact commit ground origin race ethnic religion entrust pari territori polic prosecutor offic said offens carri maximum penalti four year imprison fine prosecutor offic said know whether tag intend insult jewish peopl claim jewish membership particularli involv blue star yellow one stencil mark facad way manifestli indiffer build hous say public prosecutor therefor establish star anti semit connot dismiss hand earlier morn arrondiss town hall reveal receiv sever report star david stencil numer wall act stencil reminisc method use second world war led extermin million jew wrote municip press releas denounc anti semit act anti semit plaster street darkest hour also comment carin petit borough mayor similar tag appear last weekend pari suburb includ vanv fontenay aux rose haut sein well aubervilli saint ouen sein saint deni stencil accompani inscript sea jordan palestin overcom firmli condemn racist anti semit act culprit must arrest judg utmost sever react mayor saint ouen karim bouamran monday anti semit crime reiter aubervilli mayor karin franclet condemn graffiti de act behalf govern condemn de act absolut firm react prime minist elisabeth born french assembl national tuesday said attack someon jewish attack soul republ duti republ protect jew franc insist assert guilti act must question condemn noth toler justifi excus sinc hama attack israel octob report anti semit act regist franc accord french ministri interior sunday french minist justic eric dupond moretti report arrest anti semit act
Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi's message from behind bars,"    The activist and journalist expressed her 'sincere gratitude' to the Nobel Committee, lionized the 'non-violent and unstoppable' human rights movement in Iran, and concluded hopefully: 'Victory is not easy, but it is certain.' ","""Victory is not easy, but it is certain,"" imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize winner and women's rights activist Narges Mohammadi, said in a message smuggled out of her Tehran cell and published late on Tuesday, October 31.In the message, read out in French by her daughter, Kiana Rahmani, and posted on the official Nobel website, the 51-year-old activist and journalist expressed ""sincere gratitude"" to the Norwegian Nobel committee.Mohammadi – who was awarded the prize in early October ""for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran"" – once again criticized the requirement for women in Iran to wear a head scarf, and denounced Iranian authorities.""The compulsory hijab is a means of control and repression imposed on society and on which the continuation and survival of this authoritarian religious regime depends,"" she declared through her 17-year-old daughter, who has taken refuge in France along with her family. She condemned ""a regime that has institutionalized deprivation and poverty in society for 45 years,"" adding that it was ""built on lies, deception, cunning, and intimidation"".Arrested 13 times, sentenced five times to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes, and imprisoned again since 2021, Narges Mohammadi is one of the women spearheading the ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" uprising in Iran.The movement, which has seen women take off their headdresses, cut their hair, and demonstrate in the streets, was sparked by the death of a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, last year after she was arrested in Tehran for failing to comply with the strict Islamic dress code.On Saturday, Armita Garawand, a 17-year-old ethnic Kurd, died a week after she was declared ""brain dead"". She had been hospitalized since October 1 after falling unconscious on the metro. Rights groups have said the teen was critically wounded during an alleged assault by female members of Iran's morality police. The authorities dispute this account, saying she suddenly fell ill.""We, the people of Iran, demand democracy, freedom, human rights, and equality, and the Islamic Republic is the main obstacle in the way of realizing these national demands,"" Mohammadi said in her message. ""We[...] are struggling to transition away from this religious authoritarian regime through solidarity and drawing on the power of a non-violent and unstoppable process in order to revive the honor and pride of Iran and human dignity and prestige for its people,"" she continued in the message from Evin prison.""Victory is not easy, but it is certain,"" she concluded. It was not disclosed how the message was smuggled out.Kiana Rahmani, who read out the 10-minute message sent by Narges Mohammadi, and her twin brother Ali will represent their imprisoned mother at the award ceremony in Oslo on December 10, the Norwegian Nobel Institute announced Wednesday.The Peace Prize has on five occasions honored jailed activists, including last year's winner Ales Bialiatski of Belarus, whose prize was accepted by his wife, and Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo in 2010, whose chair remained empty.",Global-issues,victory easy certain imprisoned nobel peace prize winner womens rights activist narges mohammadi said message smuggled tehran cell published late tuesday october message read french daughter kiana rahmani posted official nobel website year old activist journalist expressed sincere gratitude norwegian nobel committee mohammadi awarded prize early october fight oppression women iran criticized requirement women iran wear head scarf denounced iranian authorities compulsory hijab means control repression imposed society continuation survival authoritarian religious regime depends declared year old daughter taken refuge france along family condemned regime institutionalized deprivation poverty society years adding built lies deception cunning intimidation arrested times sentenced five times total years prison lashes imprisoned since narges mohammadi one women spearheading woman life freedom uprising iran movement seen women take headdresses cut hair demonstrate streets sparked death year old iranian kurdish woman mahsa amini last year arrested tehran failing comply strict islamic dress code saturday armita garawand year old ethnic kurd died week declared brain dead hospitalized since october falling unconscious metro rights groups said teen critically wounded alleged assault female members irans morality police authorities dispute account saying suddenly fell ill people iran demand democracy freedom human rights equality islamic republic main obstacle way realizing national demands mohammadi said message struggling transition away religious authoritarian regime solidarity drawing power non violent unstoppable process order revive honor pride iran human dignity prestige people continued message evin prison victory easy certain concluded disclosed message smuggled kiana rahmani read minute message sent narges mohammadi twin brother ali represent imprisoned mother award ceremony oslo december norwegian nobel institute announced wednesday peace prize five occasions honored jailed activists including last years winner ales bialiatski belarus whose prize accepted wife chinese dissident liu xiaobo whose chair remained empty,victori easi certain imprison nobel peac prize winner women right activist narg mohammadi said messag smuggl tehran cell publish late tuesday octob messag read french daughter kiana rahmani post offici nobel websit year old activist journalist express sincer gratitud norwegian nobel committe mohammadi award prize earli octob fight oppress women iran critic requir women iran wear head scarf denounc iranian author compulsori hijab mean control repress impos societi continu surviv authoritarian religi regim depend declar year old daughter taken refug franc along famili condemn regim institution depriv poverti societi year ad built lie decept cun intimid arrest time sentenc five time total year prison lash imprison sinc narg mohammadi one women spearhead woman life freedom upris iran movement seen women take headdress cut hair demonstr street spark death year old iranian kurdish woman mahsa amini last year arrest tehran fail compli strict islam dress code saturday armita garawand year old ethnic kurd die week declar brain dead hospit sinc octob fall unconsci metro right group said teen critic wound alleg assault femal member iran moral polic author disput account say suddenli fell ill peopl iran demand democraci freedom human right equal islam republ main obstacl way realiz nation demand mohammadi said messag struggl transit away religi authoritarian regim solidar draw power non violent unstopp process order reviv honor pride iran human digniti prestig peopl continu messag evin prison victori easi certain conclud disclos messag smuggl kiana rahmani read minut messag sent narg mohammadi twin brother ali repres imprison mother award ceremoni oslo decemb norwegian nobel institut announc wednesday peac prize five occas honor jail activist includ last year winner ale bialiatski belaru whose prize accept wife chines dissid liu xiaobo whose chair remain empti
French wines and spirits set new export record,"    Overseas sales of champagne, cognac, Burgundy wine and other French spirits have exceeded the €17-billion mark for the first time ","Has the Covid crisis dissipated in fumes of alcohol? Whether it's champagne, cognac or wine, never before has the French trade balance done so well from the export of these home-grown products as it did in 2022. According to figures published on Tuesday, February 14, by the Federation of French Wine and Spirits Exporters (FEVS), the amount of French alcohol sold outside France has exceeded the historical record of €17 billion. This reflects a 10.8% increase from 2021, a year that had already seen a strong rebound after the bumpy ride caused by the global pandemic. The net balance reached €15.7 billion, up 10%, consolidating the wine and spirits sector's position as the second largest contributor to the balance of trade surplus after aeronautics.""The 2022 balance sheet is both momentous and surprising,"" said FEVS Chairman César Giron, who is pleased with this performance given the ""turbulent context and significant logistical limitations."" However, Giron does not deny that part of this growth in the value of exports is driven by inflation, which has soared worldwide. And he acknowledged that volumes sold have fallen by 3.8%. But he said he is satisfied to see that the growth is ""fairly evenly distributed between wines and spirits and across all geographical areas.""One particular driving force behind this stood out in 2022 and continues to do so, namely the American market. Exports of cognac, champagne, rosé from Provence and red wine from Burgundy jumped a further 14% to €4.7 billion across the Atlantic. The United States confirmed its position as the number one destination for French spirits, way ahead of the United Kingdom which, two years after Brexit, is still very fond of French beverages. Next in line are China, where growth was stopped short; Germany; and Singapore. The FEVS also points to new potential, particularly in Africa, which has seen exports to the continent increase by 21%, or €440 million.Among the most widely acclaimed alcoholic drinks, champagne was particularly popular in 2022. International trade in this sparkling wine increased by 20%, reaching a record level of €4.2 billion, with sales of 187 million bottles. This figure is also rising, enough to outpace cognac, which has seen a fall in the number of bottles sold despite a continuing increase in value, with a turnover of €3.9 billion.Cognac has been particularly affected by the slowdown in the Chinese market, where the zero-Covid strategy disrupted the daily lives of its inhabitants. This slowdown has also affected the Bordeaux vineyards, with China importing almost a quarter fewer bottles of French wine.

"A burger (vegetarian, or not) for lunch? Le Monde's 5 favorite Paris burger joints","    Thick, melting beef or a tasty chickpea patty grilled between two tempting buns: The burger is in the mix more than ever and is inspired by all countries. Now that the January detox is over, we can indulge ourselves, right? ","The first French fast-food restaurant was born in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris in 1961. It was the French version of the Wimpy chain, created in Chicago. Since then, the capital has seen a succession of trends and a parade of just about anything and everything between buns, since the burger is a mutable product. Popularized in France by McDonald's and Quick, it was the embodiment of junk food for a long time before being adopted first by bistros, then by the great French chefs at the beginning of the 21st century. Joël Robuchon and Eric Frechon dared to pair the American icon with foie gras. Alain Ducasse tried a big boudin burger and a more classic beef burger, coated with Bearnaise sauce.One would have thought that the Parisian history of the burger would end with this gourmet cultural appropriation. But a new generation of small establishments (Blend, Dumbo, Sold Out, Cuties Burger, Blossom Burgers) have decided to go back to the roots, taking their cue from American chains like Shake Shack, Five Guys and In-N-Out. Even better, some mad scientists are now daring unprecedented cultural mixes: Asian (at Shiso Burger), Peruvian (at APU) and African (at Bomaye).In our selection, we have tried to highlight these different facets of the fast food star. You can try them all if you feel like it... and if you have a strong stomach!At Dumbo, the cooks play patty-cake with the meat! The ball of matured ground beef, from the meticulous butcher Huguenin, is skilfully crushed on the cooking plate to form a thin patty. This is called smashing the meat. The advantage? When it is sufficiently fatty (as is the case here), it browns to become fabulously crispy. The rest of the formula? A Parisian potato bun (a brioche bun made from potatoes, designed by Bread Shop), homemade pickles, American cheese (a melted paste similar to cheddar), mustard and ketchup. This cheeseburger (€10) is the only reference on the menu, with a vegetarian version, the earth burger (€13), a little less convincing. The formula is minimal, the two locations too small to fit many in, and Dumbo, created in 2019, is now followed by very serious competitors (like Echo or Bikini). But it still remains a timeless HQ for street food lovers and ""the"" reference point for the smash burger in the capital. And bam!Lovers of XXL burgers, Goiko should become your canteen. This company born in Madrid quickly conquered Spain before offering its decadent delights in Paris. Here, one clearly does not come for the décor, lit with multicolored neon lights, nor for the slightly hesitant service (the staff is essentially Spanish-speaking), but for the unabashedly sumptuous and calorie-drenched burgers. The best-seller is called the Kevin Bacon (€13.50). You might laugh, but not for long, in front of a husky cook who mixes pieces of bacon directly on the grill into the minced beef (also from Spain). Layered atop this invigorating mixture, between ultra-moist and plump buns, you will find fried onions, cheddar cheese and... a little bit of whatever we want. The fast-food restaurant offers a little bit of everything: Mexican jalapeños, goat cheese, egg, candied tomato, or even extra red and white meat. But think twice before playing the mad scientist: The basic recipes are tasty and are more than enough to fill you up, or even to get you started on a good nap.This two-story establishment in the Beaupassage food court, with large photos of fathers and sons, is more than just another burger joint. Since Antoine's sudden death in a hit-and-run accident, his multi-starred father Yannick Alléno has turned it into a temple of transmission. But it's a gastronomic and joyful temple where street food and haute cuisine frolic together to create gourmet burgers. Here, the meat is from Normandy, the fried buns are prepared at the Pavillon Ledoyen (Alléno's parent company, near the Champs-Elysées) and the sauces are seasonal (the house mayonnaise is flavored with parsley in winter and with lovage in summer). As for the potatoes cut ""coin de rue” (“corner of the street,"" following irregular angles), perfectly crunchy and soft, electrified by paprika, we have rarely eaten such good ones. We recommend the house classics: Arsène (meat seasoned like a pepper steak, €15), Nikita (with the classic combo of cheddar and bacon, €17) and Lupin (vegetarian steak, beetroot, semolina, €14). Also try the ephemeral creations of chef Anisa Usmanova, who, for example, concocted a Japanese delicacy by marinating beef in soy and wrapping it in a shiso leaf.The name doesn't lie. These cutie burgers are really cute with their potato buns (ultra-chewy brioche buns) puffed up like cozy pillows. The owner, Nadji Taright, wanted to replicate the flavors of iconic American fast food chains like In-N-Out and Shake Shack. His little establishment stands out, with its resolutely modern, pastel and uncluttered décor, in the charming old France gallery of the Passage des Panoramas. At Cuties Burger, you can find small fat-rich beef steaks (120 grams), mayo, ketchup, lemonade... just like in the United States. Yes, but the meat is matured Montbéliarde and the lemonade is homemade, as are the sauces. The ketchup (the first one we taste with delight) is a mixture of crushed tomatoes, tarragon, mint, coriander and mustard seeds. In short, the venue has succeeded in combining American tradition with French savoir faire. A special mention goes to the veggie burger, whose steak, made of chickpeas and shiitake, is a mini-patty as crispy as it is tasty. Burger-side-drink option at €17.Purists, avert your eyes! The concept of this new venue on the Rue de Paradis, already full of restaurants, is to cross continents. The owners Camille Gozé and Laurent Kalala have traveled through North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa to devise their hybrid burgers (from €12.90), which are inspired by traditional recipes. The Lion de la Teranga, with its onions and lemon sauce, takes its inspiration from Senegalese yassa chicken. Babi la Douce, putting seared tuna in a homemade bun with plantain flour, draws on the Ivorian garba. Champion d'Afrique 2022 puts a mafé sauce (made of peanut paste) on a matured black angus steak. And, here, vegetarians are catered to thanks to the Allocovor, made with plantain hummus and yogurt and mint sauce. Of course, these ""ethnic"" burgers are very far from the originals, but they punch with their sumptuousness and boldly renew the palate.",Food,first french fast food restaurant born arrondissement

'Best chef in the world' Guy Savoy stripped of Michelin star,    The 69-year-old has held Michelin's top three-star status since 2002 for his Monnaie de Paris restaurant overlooking the Seine. ,"The Michelin Guide announced on Monday, February 27, the shock decision to knock a star off the Paris restaurant of Guy Savoy, frequently named the best chef in the world.The 69-year-old has held Michelin's top three-star status since 2002 for his Monnaie de Paris restaurant overlooking the Seine, which has a sister version in Caesars Palace, Las Vegas.In November he was named best chef in the world for the sixth year running by La Liste, which aggregates thousands of reviews from around the world.Savoy's fame goes beyond the kitchen as an ambassador for the French ""art de vivre"" – he has pointedly rejected the fad for non-alcoholic drinks, for instance – and he lent his voice to the French version of the Pixar film Ratatouille.But that has not stopped Michelin from downgrading his establishment to two stars in its latest edition, published next Monday. It did the same for the upmarket seafood eatery of Christopher Coutanceau in La Rochelle.""These are exceptional restaurants, so you can imagine that these decisions are carefully considered, supported by numerous visits from our inspectors throughout the year,"" Gwendal Poullennec, head of the guide, told Agence France-Presse.The reasons are not made public and are communicated only to the chefs involved.""For such important decisions, we include not just French inspectors but also some from other countries,"" said Poullennec.The move to downgrade restaurants is always hugely controversial, especially since the suicide 20 years ago of Bernard Loiseau – a close friend of Savoy – after his restaurant lost a star. One chef, Marc Veyrat, unsuccessfully took the guide to court in 2019 after being stripped of a star and said he never again wanted to see a Michelin inspector in his restaurants.Around 20 French restaurants have also been downgraded from two to one star in the latest edition of the guide. It had not downgraded anyone since 2019, conscious of the difficulties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.Those difficulties have continued with restaurants facing staffing shortages and, in the last year, soaring prices. But the guide says downgrades are now necessary if it is to stay relevant.""Yes, there are challenges, but they are challenges for everyone,"" said Poullennec.Created in 1900 by tire manufacturers Andre and Edouard Michelin as a guide for motorists, it now has editions across Europe, Asia, North and South America.",Food,michelin guide announced monday february shock decision knock star paris restaurant guy savoy frequently named best chef world year old held michelins top three star status since monnaie paris restaurant overlooking seine sister version caesars palace las vegas november named best chef world sixth year running liste aggregates thousands reviews around world savoys fame goes beyond kitchen ambassador french art vivre pointedly rejected fad non alcoholic drinks instance lent voice french version pixar film ratatouille stopped michelin downgrading establishment two stars latest edition published next monday upmarket seafood eatery christopher coutanceau rochelle exceptional restaurants imagine decisions carefully considered supported numerous visits inspectors throughout year gwendal poullennec head guide told agence france presse reasons made public communicated chefs involved important decisions include french inspectors also countries said poullennec move downgrade restaurants always hugely controversial especially since suicide years ago bernard loiseau close friend savoy restaurant lost star one chef marc veyrat unsuccessfully took guide court stripped star said never wanted see michelin inspector restaurants around french restaurants also downgraded two one star latest edition guide downgraded anyone since conscious difficulties caused covid pandemic difficulties continued restaurants facing staffing shortages last year soaring prices guide says downgrades necessary stay relevant yes challenges challenges everyone said poullennec created tire manufacturers andre edouard michelin guide motorists editions across europe asia north south america,michelin guid announc monday februari shock decis knock star pari restaur guy savoy frequent name best chef world year old held michelin top three star statu sinc monnai pari restaur overlook sein sister version caesar palac la vega novemb name best chef world sixth year run list aggreg thousand review around world savoy fame goe beyond kitchen ambassador french art vivr pointedli reject fad non alcohol drink instanc lent voic french version pixar film ratatouil stop michelin downgrad establish two star latest edit publish next monday upmarket seafood eateri christoph coutanceau rochel except restaur imagin decis care consid support numer visit inspector throughout year gwendal poullennec head guid told agenc franc press reason made public commun chef involv import decis includ french inspector also countri said poullennec move downgrad restaur alway huge controversi especi sinc suicid year ago bernard loiseau close friend savoy restaur lost star one chef marc veyrat unsuccess took guid court strip star said never want see michelin inspector restaur around french restaur also downgrad two one star latest edit guid downgrad anyon sinc consciou difficulti caus covid pandem difficulti continu restaur face staf shortag last year soar price guid say downgrad necessari stay relev ye challeng challeng everyon said poullennec creat tire manufactur andr edouard michelin guid motorist edit across europ asia north south america
"In France, food inflation continues to rise","    As negotations between manufacturers and retailers end tensely, consumers can brace for further price increases in grocery costs. ","A year ago, the subject of food inflation was beginning to stir up a debate. Manufacturers and distributors were negotiating average price increases of around 3.5%. Since then, prices on supermarket shelves have continued to increase, reaching as high as 14.5% in some rare instances. The inexorable rise in grocery prices has not ended – far from it. On Wednesday, March 1, discussions of 2023 rates held between manufacturers of consumer brand products and major chain stores ended tensely. And, with inflation expected to peak this spring, consumers will soon have to dig even deeper into their wallets.At the end of the negotiations, industry representatives shared their assessments of the situation. The prices paid by distributors to major brand manufacturers should increase by ""about 10%,"" said Jacques Creyssel, managing director of the French Federation of Commerce and Distribution (FCD). That figure was corroborated by Richard Panquiault, managing director of the Consumer Business Liaison Institute (ILEC), which represents major suppliers. He added that the average increase requested at the beginning of the negotiations was between 14% and 15%.Small businesses seem to have asked for less. ""We had formulated average rate increases of 10 to 11%, and we should reach 7 to 8%,"" said Léonard Prunier, president of the Federation of French Companies and Entrepreneurs (FEEF), an organization for small business suppliers of large retailers.The inflationary context furthered tensions in the discussions (which began on December 1, 2022), particularly between multinational corporations and large retailers. The heads of major chains were quick to criticize price proposals described as exaggerated or even ""delusional."" Putting Nestlé, Coca-Cola, Mondelez and Unilever in their sights was a way of dealing with consumers by warning them of an impending new wave of inflation.Though discussions usually come down to the final hours, the situation was more extreme this time around. ""The day before, [on] Tuesday, February 28, 40% of the contracts were not signed. Normally, that rate is more like 20%, or even 25%,"" said Panquiault. Jean-Philippe André, president of the National Association of Food Industries (ANIA) and head of Haribo, said, ""At noon on Wednesday, March 1, we had signed agreements with two major distribution networks out of five.""He wanted a 26% increase in the price of his candy. However, he believed that overall, at the stroke of midnight, ""95% of the contracts will be signed, as usual. But what matters is the quality of the signature."" In cases of deadlock, stakeholders can refer to a commercial relations mediator. ""This year, for the first time, the mediator has been called on as much by manufacturers as by distributors,"" said André.",Food,year ago subject food inflation beginning stir debate manufacturers distributors negotiating average price increases around since prices supermarket shelves continued increase reaching high rare instances inexorable rise grocery prices ended far wednesday march discussions rates held manufacturers consumer brand products major chain stores ended tensely inflation expected peak spring consumers soon dig even deeper wallets end negotiations industry representatives shared assessments situation prices paid distributors major brand manufacturers increase said jacques creyssel managing director french federation commerce distribution fcd figure corroborated richard panquiault managing director consumer business liaison institute ilec represents major suppliers added average increase requested beginning negotiations small businesses seem asked less formulated average rate increases reach said onard prunier president federation french companies entrepreneurs feef organization small business suppliers large retailers inflationary context furthered tensions discussions began december particularly multinational corporations large retailers heads major chains quick criticize price proposals described exaggerated even delusional putting nestl coca cola mondelez unilever sights way dealing consumers warning impending new wave inflation though discussions usually come final hours situation extreme time around day tuesday february contracts signed normally rate like even said panquiault jean philippe andr president national association food industries ania head haribo said noon wednesday march signed agreements two major distribution networks five wanted increase price candy however believed overall stroke midnight contracts signed usual matters quality signature cases deadlock stakeholders refer commercial relations mediator year first time mediator called much manufacturers distributors said andr,year ago subject food inflat begin stir debat manufactur distributor negoti averag price increas around sinc price supermarket shelv continu increas reach high rare instanc inexor rise groceri price end far wednesday march discuss rate held manufactur consum brand product major chain store end tens inflat expect peak spring consum soon dig even deeper wallet end negoti industri repres share assess situat price paid distributor major brand manufactur increas said jacqu creyssel manag director french feder commerc distribut fcd figur corrobor richard panquiault manag director consum busi liaison institut ilec repres major supplier ad averag increas request begin negoti small busi seem ask less formul averag rate increas reach said onard prunier presid feder french compani entrepreneur feef organ small busi supplier larg retail inflationari context further tension discuss began decemb particularli multin corpor larg retail head major chain quick critic price propos describ exagger even delusion put nestl coca cola mondelez unilev sight way deal consum warn impend new wave inflat though discuss usual come final hour situat extrem time around day tuesday februari contract sign normal rate like even said panquiault jean philipp andr presid nation associ food industri ania head haribo said noon wednesday march sign agreement two major distribut network five want increas price candi howev believ overal stroke midnight contract sign usual matter qualiti signatur case deadlock stakehold refer commerci relat mediat year first time mediat call much manufactur distributor said andr
"In Copenhagen, Noma is closing while Geranium is growing",Feature,"How do you define Danish gastronomy? Until recently, those interested in the subject would have answered 'Noma' without hesitation. Inaugurated in 2004, the three-Michelin-star restaurant in Copenhagen changed Denmark's image by promoting local ingredients. The country has gone from being the homeland of the frikadelle (meatball) to a major player in global gastronomy, capable of overshadowing France.Today, the definition seems to be about to change: In July 2022, Copenhagen's Geranium was named world's best restaurant in the 50 Best Restaurants ranking, a place long held by Noma. And in January 2023, the latter announced, to everyone's surprise, that it would close in 2024, a revolution in a small city with a high level of influence.Copenhagen has been dictating global trends in gastronomy for nearly two decades. Its rise began in the early 2000s, when Danish chef René Redzepi and restaurateur Claus Meyer came up with the idea of opening a restaurant that would showcase local produce – which no one had previously assumed could provide the raw material for a gourmet meal. ""Before, everything was imported. We showed that we could do incredible things without using foie gras, turbot or caviar,"" said Meyer (who is no longer associated with the restaurant).At Noma, the world discovered that berries, mushrooms, flowers and wild plants picked in the Danish forest tasted good, that fermenting and canning summer crops makes them last through the winter and that fish from the Baltic can compete with fish from the Mediterranean. Most of the celebrated products are recognizable on the plate: shrimp served live on ice, radishes buried in an edible soil of malt flour and hazelnuts and sorrel leaves sprinkled with a grasshopper-based powder.""From the beginning, Redzepi and Meyer gave their venture a political dimension by establishing a manifesto of new Nordic cuisine [seasonal and locavore], designed by several chefs,"" said Nicolas Chatenier, author of the book La Clé anglaise (""The Monkey Wrench""), which explores culinary geopolitics. This new Nordic cuisine has been financially supported since 2006 by the Nordic Council of Ministers, then by the Danish Tourism Board.Innovative and driven by Denmark's ambition to promote its culture, Noma drew the spotlight on Copenhagen and was soon emulated by others. Abroad, Peruvian and South African chefs were embracing the idea of using only local ingredients without importing anything. The locavore trend has affected all types of restaurants, from street food stalls to small bistros and large venues. ""[In Denmark,] many of us followed suit,"" said Nicolai Norregaard, chef at Kadeau, a locavore haute cuisine restaurant, which launched on the island of Bornholm, in 2007.",Food,define danish gastronomy recently interested subject would answered noma without hesitation inaugurated three michelin star restaurant copenhagen changed denmarks image promoting local ingredients country gone homeland frikadelle meatball major player global gastronomy capable overshadowing france today definition seems change july copenhagens geranium named worlds best restaurant best restaurants ranking place long held noma january latter announced everyones surprise would close revolution small city high level influence copenhagen dictating global trends gastronomy nearly two decades rise began early danish chef ren redzepi restaurateur claus meyer came idea opening restaurant would showcase local produce one previously assumed could provide raw material gourmet meal everything imported showed could incredible things without using foie gras turbot caviar said meyer longer associated restaurant noma world discovered berries mushrooms flowers wild plants danish forest tasted good fermenting canning summer crops makes last winter fish baltic compete fish mediterranean celebrated products recognizable plate shrimp served live ice radishes buried edible soil malt flour hazelnuts sorrel leaves sprinkled grasshopper based powder beginning redzepi meyer gave venture political dimension establishing manifesto new nordic cuisine seasonal locavore designed several chefs said nicolas chatenier author book anglaise monkey wrench explores culinary geopolitics new nordic cuisine financially supported since nordic council ministers danish tourism board innovative driven denmarks ambition promote culture noma drew spotlight copenhagen soon emulated others abroad peruvian south african chefs embracing idea using local ingredients without importing anything locavore trend affected types restaurants street food stalls small bistros large venues denmark many followed suit said nicolai norregaard chef kadeau locavore haute cuisine restaurant launched island bornholm,defin danish gastronomi recent interest subject would answer noma without hesit inaugur three michelin star restaur copenhagen chang denmark imag promot local ingredi countri gone homeland frikadel meatbal major player global gastronomi capabl overshadow franc today definit seem chang juli copenhagen geranium name world best restaur best restaur rank place long held noma januari latter announc everyon surpris would close revolut small citi high level influenc copenhagen dictat global trend gastronomi nearli two decad rise began earli danish chef ren redzepi restaurateur clau meyer came idea open restaur would showcas local produc one previous assum could provid raw materi gourmet meal everyth import show could incred thing without use foie gra turbot caviar said meyer longer associ restaur noma world discov berri mushroom flower wild plant danish forest tast good ferment canning summer crop make last winter fish baltic compet fish mediterranean celebr product recogniz plate shrimp serv live ice radish buri edibl soil malt flour hazelnut sorrel leav sprinkl grasshopp base powder begin redzepi meyer gave ventur polit dimens establish manifesto new nordic cuisin season locavor design sever chef said nicola chateni author book anglais monkey wrench explor culinari geopolit new nordic cuisin financi support sinc nordic council minist danish tourism board innov driven denmark ambit promot cultur noma drew spotlight copenhagen soon emul other abroad peruvian south african chef embrac idea use local ingredi without import anyth locavor trend affect type restaur street food stall small bistro larg venu denmark mani follow suit said nicolai norregaard chef kadeau locavor haut cuisin restaur launch island bornholm
Paris' Ecole Ferrandi young cooks are ready to shake up the industry,"    A new generation of restaurant entrepreneurs is inspired by contemporary codes made of short circuits, social media and culinary identity. ","Gathered around a work surface, the young members of the brigade are receiving their final instructions. ""Be ready at 11:50 am sharp. I'd also like to see more respect for silence in the kitchen during service, it's important,"" briefs the chef for the day, Juliette Coignet, 20.In the kitchen and in the pastry corner, only students in their third year of training at the cooking school Ecole Ferrandi in Paris, are attending. That day, however, nearly sixty guests are waiting for them in the school's training restaurant.Entirely redesigned, from the decoration to the menu, it was renamed ""En soi,"" the name of the original concept imagined by the students of the class. This is the highlight of the ""culinary arts and entrepreneurship"" bachelor's degree program, which also exists in Rennes and Bordeaux. Students worked for several weeks on new restaurant concepts, formulated business plans and then brought them to life over the course of a few days.In this first concept, the students offer to rediscover spices, by giving center stage to the initial raw plant, often forgotten. Berries, bark, flowers... These dried plants, which give birth to colored powders, are featured at the restaurant's entrance and customers are invited to smell and touch them before tasting their dish.""We wanted to offer a complete sensory experience,"" said Barbara Mazaud, 22, who switched to the Bachelor's program at Ferrandi after two years of medical studies. ""This type of added value has become necessary to stand out: It's something we're reminded of for the day we want to start our own business.""This is what almost all students aspire to in the short or medium term.

In the kitchens, students, smartphones in hand, film their preparations in close-up to post them on social media.

"In France, frog legs are still going strong","The emblematic amphibian of French gastronomy has become increasingly rare. But the appetite for its delicate meat persists, as renowned chefs are putting it back on the menu.","In the beginning, the frogs, six in all, were curled up in a small cast iron pan. The protruding torsos and fleshy thighs, browned in olive oil and arranged in a ""Y"" shape, splashed for the last time in a pool of foaming butter delicately flavored with garlic. The dish arrived hot. As the waitress placed it on the table, we all heard a faint sizzling sound, like a dull, diffuse crackling, the result of the meat caramelizing. As the noise reached our ears, all I could hear was the song of crickets and the distant croaking of frogs – the original soundtrack of woods and thickets, of long summer nights in the countryside.We were seated at Allard's amidst white tablecloths, flowered tapestries and varnished woodwork with a time-worn patina. In this typical Parisian bistro, founded in 1932 and taken over by Alain Ducasse in 2013, frog legs, the jewel of French gastronomy, has never really left the menu. They hold a place of honor here alongside Burgundy snails, beef bourguignon, roasted salmon steaks and all those old culinary acquaintances the house has developed as specialties.But to me, frog legs seemed to belong to another category that day: one of the gastronomic experiences that summon the imagination and provoke a whole series of chain reactions. In the center of the plate, the amphibians' legs looked to me like dismantled puppet legs. ""After all, it's only a frog,"" I said to myself for encouragement, as I brought the first victim to my lips. Once in my mouth, the texture of the meat, both tender and lean, somewhere between that of poultry and freshwater fish, was hard to define. As I pulled the meat apart with my teeth, frog bones about the size of toothpicks piled up in the corner of my plate. The larger the pile, the more giant my hands became in proportion, and the more I felt like an ogre. Was this a restaurant or a Grimm Brothers fairy tale? I asked for my plate to be cleared quickly, so as to avoid seeing a young, dazed prince appear in it, like a remake of The Frog Prince flavored with parsley butter.In the fantasy world of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, young wizards sometimes sink their teeth into chocolate frogs that have the annoying habit of suddenly coming to life, leaping up and escaping from whoever tries to swallow them. In gastronomy, the reality is different. In an old episode of La Cuisine des mousquetaires posted on the INA YouTube account and entitled ""Les cuisses de grenouilles à la gasconne de Maïté,"" (Maïté's Gascon Frogs), the most well-known southwestern French chef on television explained how difficult this rare and expensive dish can be to prepare. ""To begin with, unfortunately, you'll have to manage to keep them still and peel them,"" she said, referring to the animals that she purchased alive and that were already difficult to find at the end of the 1990s.",Food,beginning frogs six curled small cast iron pan protruding torsos fleshy thighs browned olive oil arranged shape splashed last time pool foaming butter delicately flavored garlic dish arrived hot waitress placed table heard faint sizzling sound like dull diffuse crackling result meat caramelizing noise reached ears could hear song crickets distant croaking frogs original soundtrack woods thickets long summer nights countryside seated allards amidst white tablecloths flowered tapestries varnished woodwork time worn patina parisian bistro founded taken alain ducasse frog legs jewel french gastronomy never really left menu hold place honor alongside burgundy snails beef bourguignon roasted salmon steaks old culinary acquaintances house developed specialties frog legs seemed belong another category day one gastronomic experiences summon imagination provoke whole series chain reactions center plate amphibians legs looked like dismantled puppet legs frog said encouragement brought first victim lips mouth texture meat tender lean somewhere poultry freshwater fish hard define pulled meat apart teeth frog bones size tooth piled corner plate larger pile giant hands became proportion felt like ogre restaurant grimm brothers fairy tale asked plate cleared quickly avoid seeing young dazed prince appear like remake frog prince flavored parsley butter fantasy world rowlings harry potter young wizards sometimes sink teeth chocolate frogs annoying habit suddenly coming life leaping escaping whoever tries swallow gastronomy reality different old episode cuisine des mousquetaires posted ina youtube account entitled les cuisses grenouilles gasconne gascon frogs well known southwestern french chef television explained difficult rare expensive dish prepare begin unfortunately youll manage keep still peel said referring animals purchased alive already difficult find end,begin frog six curl small cast iron pan protrud torso fleshi thigh brown oliv oil arrang shape splash last time pool foam butter delic flavor garlic dish arriv hot waitress place tabl heard faint sizzl sound like dull diffus crackl result meat caramel nois reach ear could hear song cricket distant croak frog origin soundtrack wood thicket long summer night countrysid seat allard amidst white tablecloth flower tapestri varnish woodwork time worn patina parisian bistro found taken alain ducass frog leg jewel french gastronomi never realli left menu hold place honor alongsid burgundi snail beef bourguignon roast salmon steak old culinari acquaint hous develop specialti frog leg seem belong anoth categori day one gastronom experi summon imagin provok whole seri chain reaction center plate amphibian leg look like dismantl puppet leg frog said encourag brought first victim lip mouth textur meat tender lean somewher poultri freshwat fish hard defin pull meat apart teeth frog bone size tooth pile corner plate larger pile giant hand becam proport felt like ogr restaur grimm brother fairi tale ask plate clear quickli avoid see young daze princ appear like remak frog princ flavor parsley butter fantasi world rowl harri potter young wizard sometim sink teeth chocol frog annoy habit suddenli come life leap escap whoever tri swallow gastronomi realiti differ old episod cuisin de mousquetair post ina youtub account entitl le cuiss grenouil gasconn gascon frog well known southwestern french chef televis explain difficult rare expens dish prepar begin unfortun youll manag keep still peel said refer anim purchas aliv alreadi difficult find end
Michelin 2023 awards: List of winners gives pride of place to French regions,"    One new three-star, four new two-stars, 39 newcomers to the ranking and 90 green stars distinguish an edition that also highlights some very young talents. ","After inviting itself to Cognac in 2022, this year's Michelin stars were awarded in Strasbourg on Monday, March 6, at the Palais de la Musique et des Congrès. More than 1,500 guests (French and foreign chefs and journalists) attended the event, which included a reception the day before with a folkloric flavor, hostesses in traditional costume and an enormous meal with sauerkraut and Munster cheese.The Michelin machine was determined to flex its muscles in the face of its rivals (Gault & Millau, 50 Best) and to continue to build on its provincial momentum, in order to raise the profile of the winners, the vast majority of which are located outside Paris. Out of 44 establishments receiving stars, 37 are situated outside of the capital, while due to a lack of means, or for convenience, critics and the press often remain focused on the French capital.Only one three-star restaurant was awarded this year, compared to two last year (Dimitri Droisneau and Arnaud Donckele): Alexandre Couillon, whose remote restaurant La Marine is based in Noirmoutier in the west of the country, had long been among the favorites for this promotion. Although the fish virtuoso is far from being an unknown, it is not certain that his rise will be enough to distract from the news of the stars that have been withdrawn from chefs who receive much more media coverage, notably Michel Sarran (who went from two to one star) and especially Guy Savoy, a monument who lost his third star (acquired in 2002).Four new two-star hotels, 39 newcomers: The number of establishments honored in this edition is slightly lower than in previous editions. The list of winners highlights some of the trends already identified in the guide. First of all, excluding the overseas territories (which unfortunately are not inspected), all of France is represented. ""The dynamics we are observing are even affecting regions that were previously under-represented, such as the Pays de la Loire and Hauts-de-France,"" observed the guide's director, Gwendal Poullennec. These starred chefs are defending the traditional terroir, but it is a terroir often jostled by exotic influences. At Rozó, in the northern department of Marcq-en-Barœul (whose star Le Monde predicted), herring can be found wriggling under a Korean chili pepper.Women remain poorly represented. Only one who works alone was awarded a star: Georgiana Viou, who creates Mediterranean plates with a hint of her native Benin at Rouge, in Nîmes. ""There is no discrimination, no quota, related to the gender of the chefs or any other criteria whatsoever,"" says Gwendal Poullennec. Our inspectors base their judgments on the quality of the establishment."" However, many couples working together have been highlighted. This is the case again at Rozó, where chef Diego Delbecq and pastry chef Camille Pailleau work in tandem. This is also true for the Strasbourg one-star restaurant led by the duo Jeanne Satori and David Degoursy.It is also possible to identify the rise of an ambitious young guard: Camille Saint-M'Leux, Thibaut Spiwack, Omar Dhiab, Mallory Gabsi and so on. Gabsi, a 26-year-old former ""Top Chef"" candidate, obtained a star (and the Michelin Young Chef Award) after less than a year of opening a Parisian restaurant in his name! The red guide has already been accused of succumbing to youthism. When Mory Sacko received his first star in 2021, at 28, the culinary journalist François-Régis Gaudry compared the guide to ""an old lady who walks with her walker and tries to chase after the trends"". Sometimes, the Michelin Man also arrives a bit late. Couillon was crowned ""cook of the year"" by Gault & Millau... in 2017.This list will not put an end to another recurring complaint: the opacity of the guide's choices. It is hard not to wonder, for example, how Pascal Barbot, who only reopened Astrance on December 31, could so quickly regain a star. And the green stars, which reward sustainable gastronomy (this year, 90 French restaurants were selected in total), lack clarity and visibility. No particular plaque is proposed to be placed on the distinguished restaurants.",Food,inviting cognac years michelin stars awarded strasbourg monday march palais musique des congr guests french

How raclette became a cheery cheesy life philosophy,Nicolas Santolaria manages not to melt as he examines this meltingly friendly fromage dish that drips with positivity across the charcuterie board.,"We've all seen the videos of wood fires that are available on YouTube and other streaming platforms and give gas-heated city dwellers the soothing feeling of sitting before a crackling alpine fire. In a similarly anxiety-provoking vein, along with Patagonia fleece jackets and sessions on indoor rock-climbing walls, melted cheese has crept to the forefront of our dreamy lowland mountain lives. Delivery app Getir recently announced a 50% increase in raclette cheese orders on its site between October 2022 and January 2023 compared to the same period in 2021-2022. According to the same app, consumers started their orders two weeks earlier this year, beginning on October 24.But enjoying this convivial dish is not enough, it also has to be shared. This means the creamy goodness is flowing as much across our plates as it is on social networks where the cascade of melting cheese can be seen as entertainment in its own right, a sort of ""raclettetainment,"" if you pardon the French pun. Type ""raclette"" into the TikTok search bar, and you'll see how much the comforting dish has become event-driven: people celebrate the opening of the raclette season in pictures, document their first times as in a video entitled ""Tu fais découvrir la raclette à ton mari le blédard"" (""Introducing your hick of a husband to raclette), and organize the most unlikely challenges (having raclette during class, having a raclette on the subway, be careful for cheese lava flows).Generally, the message is that this shared meal exudes positivity. Raclette is an almost ideal form of sociability, a way of weaving cheese threads around the table, while each person sticks to their own tray. DJ Matafan, an up-and-coming artist from Savoie, the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region that celebrates this dish, has made a specialty of extolling the merits of what he considers a real panacea. In his video ""Magic Raclette,"" he says: ""When I feel unhappy, I eat raclette, when I feel so lonely, I eat raclette (...) and suddenly I have no more problems.""As an antidote to all our ills, raclette as a metaphor allows the visual transformation of something hard (a cheese, an era, a world) into something soft and comforting. But believing that this idea sprang up by itself would be a bit naive. In order to triumph in France as Camembert declines, the raclette industry is consciously using a Gramsci-like strategy, named after the Italian theorist of the early 20th century, who argued that any takeover of power (in this case over stomachs) should be preceded by a conquest in the cultural sphere.",Food,weve seen videos wood fires available youtube streaming platforms give gas heated city dwellers soothing feeling sitting crackling alpine fire similarly anxiety provoking vein along patagonia fleece jackets sessions indoor rock climbing walls melted cheese crept forefront dreamy lowland mountain lives delivery app getir recently announced increase raclette cheese orders site october january compared period according app consumers started orders two weeks earlier year beginning october enjoying convivial dish enough also shared means creamy goodness flowing much across plates social networks cascade melting cheese seen entertainment right sort raclettetainment pardon french pun type raclette tiktok search bar youll see much comforting dish become event driven people celebrate opening raclette season document first times video entitled fais couvrir raclette ton mari dard introducing hick husband raclette organize unlikely challenges raclette class raclette subway careful cheese lava flows generally message shared meal exudes positivity raclette almost ideal form sociability way weaving cheese threads around table person sticks tray matafan coming artist savoie auvergne alpes region celebrates dish made specialty extolling merits considers real panacea video magic raclette says feel unhappy eat raclette feel lonely eat raclette suddenly problems antidote ills raclette metaphor allows visual transformation something hard cheese era world something soft comforting believing idea sprang would bit naive order triumph france camembert declines raclette industry consciously using gramsci like strategy named italian theorist early century argued takeover power case stomachs preceded conquest cultural sphere,weve seen video wood fire avail youtub stream platform give ga heat citi dweller sooth feel sit crackl alpin fire similarli anxieti provok vein along patagonia fleec jacket session indoor rock climb wall melt chees crept forefront dreami lowland mountain live deliveri app getir recent announc increas raclett chees order site octob januari compar period accord app consum start order two week earlier year begin octob enjoy convivi dish enough also share mean creami good flow much across plate social network cascad melt chees seen entertain right sort raclettetain pardon french pun type raclett tiktok search bar youll see much comfort dish becom event driven peopl celebr open raclett season document first time video entitl fai couvrir raclett ton mari dard introduc hick husband raclett organ unlik challeng raclett class raclett subway care chees lava flow gener messag share meal exud posit raclett almost ideal form sociabl way weav chees thread around tabl person stick tray matafan come artist savoi auvergn alp region celebr dish made specialti extol merit consid real panacea video magic raclett say feel unhappi eat raclett feel lone eat raclett suddenli problem antidot ill raclett metaphor allow visual transform someth hard chees era world someth soft comfort believ idea sprang would bit naiv order triumph franc camembert declin raclett industri conscious use gramsci like strategi name italian theorist earli centuri argu takeov power case stomach preced conquest cultur sphere
Best pizza for lunch? Our five favorite addresses in Paris (and a bit beyond),"    Whether they offer Roman-style thin crust or Neapolitan-style with puffed edges, topped with burrata as big as an ostrich egg or Black Bigorre ham, our choices of pizzerias will brighten up your lunches (and dinners). ","Choosing the top pizzerias in Paris is a task as challenging as watching the 2006 France-Italy World Cup final with an Italian friend without fighting. Over the past decade, the quality of pizzas made in the capital has greatly improved. Professional ovens, high-quality ingredients, often imported, and extended fermentation processes are now the norm, leading to a new standard of excellence, directly influenced by Italian models. Gone are the days when one would sprinkle Gruyère cheese on their pizzas (yes, yes, horrified young people, that was once a thing that we did).While this selection may not include all of the fantastic pizzerias out there, some notable mentions are: Bonvivant Pizza (featuring organic flour dough that's light and easy to digest), Oxymore (using French ingredients), Da Vito (offering soft and fragrant pizzas thanks to a blend of white and wholemeal flours), Daroco and Chez Giorgio (serving perfectly crafted Neapolitan pizzas in stunning surroundings). This selection strives to bring together both new and established venues, blend Neapolitan (puffed crust) and Roman (thin crust) traditions, and offer a mix of both affordable options and indulgent treats. Buon appetito!The trend of Neapolitan pizzas has led to a neglect of Roman-style pizzas, which are often wrongly associated with the frozen horrors found in supermarkets. AVE Pizza Romana sets the record straight, serving up delicious thin-crust pizzas. Located in a charmingly dilapidated restaurant (featuring a concrete bar, stripped walls, and floor tiles), the highlight is the oven, situated in the center of the room and surrounded by an elegant oval counter. Service is prompt and prices are unbeatable (pizzas starting at just €6 during lunchtime from Tuesday to Friday).It's the pizza that truly stands out. Each pie is a large – more than 35 centimeters in diameter – thin-crusted delight, crispy at the edges and served on a plate. All of the ingredients, imported from Italy (with the exception of the yeast, as noted by pizza maker Anthony Di Mambro), stay true to the flavors of the home country. You won't find bacon here, but instead, guanciale in the carbonara pizza (€16). The cinque formaggi (€14) offers only cheeses ""made in Italy,"" including ricotta, mozzarella, taleggio, gorgonzola, and pecorino. A pizzeria worthy of Rome: top-notch.Watching Giuseppe Cutraro in action is a must to grasp why this 30-year-old Neapolitan chef has earned the title of world pizza champion multiple times. The former executive chef of the Big Mamma group now runs three locations in Paris and scoots from one to the next. He places a special emphasis on the dough, allowing it to ferment for over 24 hours for optimal hydration. The dough then undergoes a thermal shock of 390°C, resulting in a perfectly puffed crust with Neapolitan-style over-inflated and soft edges.At this Italian-style pizzeria, the majority of the products (including the waiters) are imported from Italy, featuring gorgonzola, mozzarella di bufala, cured meats, and of course, juicy tomatoes. Treat yourself to luxury toppings like the seasonal truffle-topped Queen Tartufo (€21). For a classic option, we recommend the simple Margherita (€12) to fully appreciate the tender, plump crust that's as enjoyable as a pastry.Dining at Gruppomimo feels like stepping into a Fellini film. The mini-chain turns every meal into a celebratory feast, with plenty of options for playful diners. The chunky arancini trio (truffle, bolognese, and cacio e pepe) served in a pot of creamy sauce and the pasta dishes made directly in a wheel of parmesan cheese are must-tries. The pizzas at Gruppomimo are generously sized, pushing the boundaries of Neapolitan fashion with the approval of Sicilian chef Pietro Rabboni, who is known for his expansive, over-inflated pizza crusts.Gruppomimo's rapid expansion is a testament to its generous offerings. Despite being a relatively new brand, having opened its first location in February 2021, it now boasts five locations in and around Paris. Although not necessarily renowned for its refinement, the menu at Gruppomimo offers dishes that are both visually and flavorfully pleasing, such as the basil devil pizza (€16). Topped with homemade basil pesto, juicy cherry tomatoes, and a dollop of creamy burratina in the center, the pizza is a feast for both the eyes and the taste buds. But, of course, this is not just about appearances, it is about deliciousness.The pizzeria located in the bustling Rue de Charonne boasts a unique blend of sophistication and creativity. With its refined Scandinavian-inspired decor and a drink menu focusing on sake, it offers an unexpected and daring twist to the traditional pizzeria experience. The toppings, which showcase ingredients like camembert and pastrami, are a testament to the restaurant's commitment to creativity and seasonality.The pizzeria, with its New York-inspired pies and creative toppings, has been attracting foodies for seven years on Rue de Charonne. Each month, a new ""pizza of the day"" is offered, pushing the limits of traditional toppings with unique and seasonal ingredients. The spicy honey pizza (€16) balances sweet and spicy flavors with chorizo and honey, while the cosmic ninja (€18) showcases a variety of mushrooms. Although the classic margherita is reasonably priced at €12, the notorious Bigorre (€21) with its premium black ham from Bigorre is a splurge-worthy treat. The audacious owner, Romane Gonzalez, has even contemplated adding a Hawaiian pizza to the menu.If you're looking for a true taste of Naples in Paris, look no further than this charming pizzeria in the 15th arrondissement. With its fresh ingredients, wood-fired cooking, and waiters sporting green-white-red accents, Chef Guillaume Grasso (a proud grandson of a pizza maker) has created a truly authentic dining experience. Despite its small size, the restaurant is a popular destination and early reservations are a must to secure your spot and savor its delicious offerings.At an incredible starting price of just €6, the cosacca is a must-try with its delectable tomato sauce that boasts a hint of acidity, Grana Padano cheese, fresh basil, and a drizzle of olive oil. Meanwhile, the classic pizzas, such as the one topped with anchovies and mozzarella di bufala, can be savored for just €10. For those looking to indulge, the most expensive offering on the menu is a creation made with premium bresaola and 24-month aged parmesan, priced at €18. The pizzas are baked to perfection in a wood-fired oven, resulting in a slightly puffed crust that is golden brown and infused with the aromatic scents of basil and oregano. Just a heads up, refrain from mentioning chili oil or tuna pizza to the owner as it might upset him.",Food,choosing top pizzerias paris task challenging watching france italy world cup final italian

"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: 'For good global health, let's eliminate trans fatty acids from the diet for good'","Trans fatty acids are responsible for 'bad cholesterol' and many cardiovascular diseases. Eliminating them would have a considerable health benefit, but it's urgent to involve public authorities and industry, explains the WHO director general.","Trans fat is a killer: Up to 500,000 people a year die worldwide from the consequences of eating it. Trans fat increases LDL (or ""bad"") cholesterol, the compound that clogs arteries and causes heart attacks and deaths from heart disease.Most trans fat comes from artificial, industrially-produced Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils (PHO), and is used in many baked foods, frying oils, fried foods and hardened fats, like margarine and vegetable ghee. They are cheap and increase the shelf life of processed food.But they have no known health benefit and can be readily replaced with other ingredients to preserve taste and consistency. They do nothing but harm our hearts; in essence, they are the tobacco of food products.And yet it would be so simple to eliminate them. PHO can easily be substituted with other vegetable oils that are healthier, no more expensive and taste good too, such as high-oleic vegetable oils.In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for the complete elimination of industrially-produced trans fat from the global food supply by the end of 2023. Since then, we have been supporting countries to implement policies prohibiting trans fat, and to replace it with healthier oils.There are two best-practice policy alternatives. The first is a national limit of 2 grams of industrially produced trans fat per 100 grams of total fat in all foods. The second is a national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils (a major source of trans fat).To date, more than 40 countries accounting for more than one-third of the world’s population had implemented one of the WHO’s best-practice policies on trans fat.A further 17 countries, with an additional 400 million people, are using less restrictive policies, but are still on a good path toward implementing the WHO’s package of recommended best practices.This is remarkable progress, with an almost six-fold increase in the number of people protected by best-practice policies since the launch of the initiative. The results are clear. In Denmark, the first country to eliminate trans fat, studies show that after the introduction of the regulation in 2004, there was a decrease in mortality from heart disease.However, time is of the essence if we are to achieve the goal of complete elimination by the year 2023.Many nations are heading in the right direction. For example, the United States has passed a law banning the production and use of PHO in its food supply.",Food,trans fat killer people year die worldwide consequences eating trans fat increases ldl bad cholesterol compound clogs arteries causes heart attacks deaths heart disease trans fat comes artificial industrially produced partially hydrogenated vegetable oils pho used many baked foods frying oils fried foods hardened fats like margarine vegetable ghee cheap increase shelf life processed food known health benefit readily replaced ingredients preserve taste consistency nothing harm hearts essence tobacco food products yet would simple eliminate pho easily substituted vegetable oils healthier expensive taste good high oleic vegetable oils world health organization called complete elimination industrially produced trans fat global food supply end since supporting countries implement policies prohibiting trans fat replace healthier oils two best practice policy alternatives first national limit grams industrially produced trans fat per grams total fat foods second national ban production use partially hydrogenated oils major source trans fat date countries accounting one third world population implemented one best practice policies trans fat countries additional million people using less restrictive policies still good path toward implementing package recommended best practices remarkable progress almost six fold increase number people protected best practice policies since launch initiative results clear denmark first country eliminate trans fat studies show introduction regulation decrease mortality heart disease however time essence achieve goal complete elimination year many nations heading right direction example united states passed law banning production use pho food supply,tran fat killer peopl year die worldwid consequ eat tran fat increas ldl bad cholesterol compound clog arteri caus heart attack death heart diseas tran fat come artifici industri produc partial hydrogen veget oil pho use mani bake food fri oil fri food harden fat like margarin veget ghee cheap increas shelf life process food known health benefit readili replac ingredi preserv tast consist noth harm heart essenc tobacco food product yet would simpl elimin pho easili substitut veget oil healthier expens tast good high oleic veget oil world health organ call complet elimin industri produc tran fat global food suppli end sinc support countri implement polici prohibit tran fat replac healthier oil two best practic polici altern first nation limit gram industri produc tran fat per gram total fat food second nation ban product use partial hydrogen oil major sourc tran fat date countri account one third world popul implement one best practic polici tran fat countri addit million peopl use less restrict polici still good path toward implement packag recommend best practic remark progress almost six fold increas number peopl protect best practic polici sinc launch initi result clear denmark first countri elimin tran fat studi show introduct regul decreas mortal heart diseas howev time essenc achiev goal complet elimin year mani nation head right direct exampl unit state pass law ban product use pho food suppli
"Fried chicken, hot wings and chicken waffles, 'soul food' coming to Paris from the South of the US","Forget about KFC's oil-soaked chicken drumsticks. For 15 years, another kind of tasty, more authentic fried chicken has been bringing 'soul food' to France.","I remember very well the first time I bit into a piece of fried chicken. It was in the early 2000s, I was still a teenager and the Unites States' fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), which was then expanding all over France, had just opened a franchise in the small town where I lived. The restaurant – a large gray concrete cube with the red, white and black logo of the brand – was located in the middle of nowhere, on the outskirts of an industrial zone.The bus dropped me off at one of those anonymous stops on the edge of a ring road and, with a determined effort, I walked the two kilometers to the restaurant, clutching the promotional coupon I had cut out of the local newspaper a few hours earlier. ""5 Hot Wings bought = 5 free"": Surely, it had to be worth it, I told myself, still wondering what had made me put so much effort to go out and taste 10 pieces of oil-soaked poultry. Perhaps it was the appeal of novelty? The suggestive power of a well-executed marketing operation?Looking back, I know now that I was looking for something else. I wanted to go eat at KFC like I would go see a blockbuster at the movies or like I would wear a pair of Nike sneakers or display a Michael Jordan poster in my room: To treat myself to a dose of Yankee exoticism, a little slice of the American lifestyle.Once there, I finally got my hands on the Hot Wings. In this case, a cardboard box stained with grease, in which lay an assortment of drumsticks and chicken wings. They had been seasoned with a mixture of herbs and spices, then coated with a thick layer of breadcrumbs before being briefly cooked and deep fried. An unpleasant smell of grease instantly seized my nostrils, it stuck to my fingers and embedded itself in my clothes. But strangely, that day, I enjoyed filling my mouth with fat, feeling the skin crisp under my teeth and sucking the wings to the bone. In this unappetizing junk food dish, I found a form of guilty pleasure, the taste of which would live in me from then on as a strong gustatory memory.More than fifteen years later, I met another kind of fried chicken, less heavy, tastier and above all, more authentic. I was writing an article for Le Monde's magazine on the origins of ""soul food"" and I had gone to meet the few Parisian chefs who claimed it. Alongside mac and cheese, cornbread and black-eyed peas, one of the main dishes of this ""soul food"" originating from the South of the US, which constitutes the culinary heritage of African-Americans, is fried chicken.",Food,remember well first time bit piece fried chicken early still teenager unites states fast food chain kentucky fried chicken kfc expanding france opened franchise small town lived restaurant large gray concrete cube red white black logo brand located middle nowhere outskirts industrial zone bus dropped one anonymous stops edge ring road determined effort walked two kilometers restaurant clutching promotional coupon cut local newspaper hours earlier hot wings bought free surely worth told still wondering made put much effort taste pieces oil soaked poultry perhaps appeal novelty suggestive power well executed marketing operation looking back know looking something else wanted eat kfc like would see blockbuster movies like would wear pair nike sneakers display michael jordan poster room treat dose yankee exoticism little slice american lifestyle finally got hands hot wings case cardboard box stained grease lay assortment drumsticks chicken wings seasoned mixture herbs coated thick layer breadcrumbs briefly cooked deep fried unpleasant smell grease instantly seized nostrils stuck fingers embedded clothes strangely day enjoyed filling mouth fat feeling skin crisp teeth sucking wings bone unappetizing junk food dish found form guilty pleasure taste would live strong gustatory memory fifteen years later met another kind fried chicken less heavy tastier authentic writing article mondes magazine origins soul food gone meet parisian chefs claimed alongside mac cheese cornbread black eyed peas one main dishes soul food originating south constitutes culinary heritage african americans fried chicken,rememb well first time bit piec fri chicken earli still teenag unit state fast food chain kentucki fri chicken kfc expand franc open franchis small town live restaur larg gray concret cube red white black logo brand locat middl nowher outskirt industri zone bu drop one anonym stop edg ring road determin effort walk two kilomet restaur clutch promot coupon cut local newspap hour earlier hot wing bought free sure worth told still wonder made put much effort tast piec oil soak poultri perhap appeal novelti suggest power well execut market oper look back know look someth els want eat kfc like would see blockbust movi like would wear pair nike sneaker display michael jordan poster room treat dose yanke exotic littl slice american lifestyl final got hand hot wing case cardboard box stain greas lay assort drumstick chicken wing season mixtur herb coat thick layer breadcrumb briefli cook deep fri unpleas smell greas instantli seiz nostril stuck finger embed cloth strang day enjoy fill mouth fat feel skin crisp teeth suck wing bone unappet junk food dish found form guilti pleasur tast would live strong gustatori memori fifteen year later met anoth kind fri chicken less heavi tastier authent write articl mond magazin origin soul food gone meet parisian chef claim alongsid mac chees cornbread black eye pea one main dish soul food origin south constitut culinari heritag african american fri chicken
"Alexandre Couillon, the only French chef to win the coveted three Michelin stars","    After a difficult start, the chef has made his isolated restaurant La Marine a destination thanks to a highly personal cuisine that gives pride of place to products from the sea and his vegetable garden. ","In a year that has been notably sparse in awards, Alexandre Couillon is the chosen one, the only chef to win the three-star award in the Michelin Guide France 2023. Couillon's name was not among those that were circulating – perhaps because of his remote location. His restaurant, La Marine, is located at the extreme tip of the Noirmoutier peninsula (a French island in the Bay of Biscay, connected to the mainland by the Passage du Gois causeway), facing the Atlantic Ocean and far from the gastronomic trails.Couillon's story is not one of overwhelming culinary ambition. An unsettled student, he was sent in the direction of cooking because he needed something to keep his ten fingers busy and because there was a hotel school in Noirmoutier. If he ended up settling there with his wife Céline in the family restaurant facing the harbor in 1999, at only 24 years old, it was at the request of his parents, natives of the island. His mother, a seamstress, and his father, a shrimp fisherman, had become restaurateurs at a late age and urged their son to take over the business they had bought 15 years earlier, thwarting his plans. At the time, Couillon was working with acclaimed French chef Michel Guérard, one of the founders of nouvelle cuisine. He had planned to perfect his skills by working at Alain Ducasse's restaurant and Joël  Robuchon's before setting off on his own.The beginning was difficult. ""From the end of September to June, Noirmoutier was like the Gobi desert,"" recalled the now 47-year-old chef. Obliged to open seven days a week and to have 80 covers to compensate for the vagaries of the frequentation, he chose a ""simple and traditional cuisine, without worrying too much about the produce. With Céline, we were young, carefree, insolent, we wanted to prove that we were capable of doing it,"" he analyzed.The birth of their first daughter in 2002 left the chef feeling disorganized, especially when she reached talking age and declared, ""Daddy always work."" His frustration was reinforced by a conversation with a fisherman in the harbor across from the restaurant from whom he wanted to buy fish. The fisherman laughed in his face: ""It's too expensive for you! This goes to Paris!""In 2007, Alexandre and Céline had finished paying back the restaurant's loan and were thinking of shutting up shop. But Michelin had other ideas. ""We were in the car, discussing closing when we heard on [local radio station] Alouette that La Marine had earned a star."" That distinction changed everything, ensuring an increase and regularity in patronage, especially in the region.",Food,year notably sparse awards alexandre couillon chosen one chef win three star award michelin guide france couillons name among circulating perhaps remote location restaurant marine located extreme tip noirmoutier peninsula french island bay biscay connected mainland passage gois causeway facing atlantic ocean far gastronomic trails couillons story one overwhelming culinary ambition unsettled student sent direction cooking needed something keep ten fingers busy hotel school noirmoutier ended settling wife line family restaurant facing harbor years old request parents natives island mother seamstress father shrimp fisherman become restaurateurs late age urged son take business bought years earlier thwarting plans time couillon working acclaimed french chef michel rard one founders nouvelle cuisine planned perfect skills working alain ducasses restaurant robuchons setting beginning difficult end september june noirmoutier like gobi desert recalled year old chef obliged open seven days week covers compensate vagaries frequentation chose simple traditional cuisine without worrying much produce line young carefree insolent wanted prove capable analyzed birth first daughter left chef feeling disorganized especially reached talking age declared daddy always work frustration reinforced conversation fisherman harbor across restaurant wanted buy fish fisherman laughed face expensive goes paris alexandre line finished paying back restaurants loan thinking shutting shop michelin ideas car discussing closing heard local radio station alouette marine earned star distinction changed everything ensuring increase regularity patronage especially region,year notabl spars award alexandr couillon chosen one chef win three star award michelin guid franc couillon name among circul perhap remot locat restaur marin locat extrem tip noirmouti peninsula french island bay biscay connect mainland passag goi causeway face atlant ocean far gastronom trail couillon stori one overwhelm culinari ambit unsettl student sent direct cook need someth keep ten finger busi hotel school noirmouti end settl wife line famili restaur face harbor year old request parent nativ island mother seamstress father shrimp fisherman becom restaurateur late age urg son take busi bought year earlier thwart plan time couillon work acclaim french chef michel rard one founder nouvel cuisin plan perfect skill work alain ducass restaur robuchon set begin difficult end septemb june noirmouti like gobi desert recal year old chef oblig open seven day week cover compens vagari frequent chose simpl tradit cuisin without worri much produc line young carefre insol want prove capabl analyz birth first daughter left chef feel disorgan especi reach talk age declar daddi alway work frustrat reinforc convers fisherman harbor across restaur want buy fish fisherman laugh face expens goe pari alexandr line finish pay back restaur loan think shut shop michelin idea car discuss close heard local radio station alouett marin earn star distinct chang everyth ensur increas regular patronag especi region
"Paris, capital of gastronomy: A journey through French cuisine at the Conciergerie Museum","    From royal banquets to heads of state lunches and bouillons to brasseries, the exhibition goes back over eight centuries of French culinary art from the Middle Ages to the present day. ","In people’s minds, the Conciergerie de Paris remains the last home of Marie-Antoinette before the guillotine. This former prison, which suffered greatly from the lack of foreign visitors during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, is trying to change its image by organizing exhibitions capable of arousing the interest of not only tourists but also Parisians. This is evidenced by its newest exhibition: ""Paris, capital of gastronomy, from the Middle Ages to today.""Behind the boastful title, the aim is to show the plural role of Paris, both as a melting pot where gastronomy was structured and developed and as a place of power where cuisine takes on challenges that go far beyond the pleasure of good food. This is evident as soon as you step into the impressive Salle des Gens d’Armes – the largest non-religious Gothic hall in Europe – which hosts the exhibition. It begins with the banquet held by King Charles V of France in honor of the Germanic Roman Emperor on January 6, 1378. The plethoric and poetic menu is preserved between a fragment of an engraved marble table and a small selection of period tableware borrowed from the Louvre Museum. It includes ""stuffed and gilded rabbits,"" ""eels sweetened with mud"" and ""stuffed figs covered with gold leaves.""""There is a tendency to think that French gastronomy started in the 17th century, or even with Escoffier, at the end of the 19th century,"" said Loïc Bienassis, historian at the European Institute of History and Cultures of Food and co-curator of the exhibition. ""It is actually a much older story."" It includes the feast offered by the Parisian municipal authorities to Queen Catherine de Medici in 1549 and the reception at City Hall to celebrate the recovery of Louis XIV after a serious illness in 1687. It is followed by a journey through the table of the powerful, which leads to 2015, the lunch of heads of state at COP21, chaired by François Hollande, where the menu draws its inspiration from multiple regions: scallops from Normandy, Licques in the Pas-de-Calais poultry, Reblochon from Savoie, Corsican citrus fruit from Paris-Brest.""The discourse around the richness of France’s provinces has always existed, but for a very long time, it was in Paris that these riches were transcended by political and economic elites. French political centralism can be found in French cuisine,"" said Loïc Bienassis, for whom there is a real historical legitimacy in speaking of Paris as a ""gastronomic capital."" In the exhibition, this Parisian hegemony can be seen through several narrative threads: Paris is not only the city that receives prestigious guests, but also a laboratory where the concept of the restaurant was born, ""the great invention that tipped gastronomy into modernity in the mid-1800s"", summarized Cécile Rives, administrator of the Conciergerie.",Food,people minds conciergerie paris remains last home marie antoinette guillotine former prison suffered greatly lack foreign visitors pandemic trying change image organizing exhibitions capable arousing interest tourists also parisians evidenced newest exhibition paris capital gastronomy middle ages today behind boastful title aim show plural role paris melting pot gastronomy structured developed place power cuisine takes challenges far beyond pleasure good food evident soon step impressive salle des gens armes largest non religious gothic hall europe hosts exhibition begins banquet held king charles france honor germanic roman emperor january plethoric poetic menu preserved fragment engraved marble table small selection period tableware borrowed louvre museum includes stuffed gilded rabbits eels sweetened mud stuffed figs covered gold leaves tendency think french gastronomy started century even escoffier end century said bienassis historian european institute history cultures food curator exhibition actually much older story includes feast offered parisian municipal authorities queen catherine medici reception city hall celebrate recovery louis xiv serious illness followed journey table powerful leads lunch heads state cop chaired fran ois hollande menu draws inspiration multiple regions scallops normandy licques pas calais poultry reblochon savoie corsican citrus fruit paris brest discourse around richness france provinces always existed long time paris riches transcended political economic elites french political centralism found french cuisine said bienassis real historical legitimacy speaking paris gastronomic capital exhibition parisian hegemony seen several narrative threads paris city receives prestigious guests also laboratory concept restaurant born great invention tipped gastronomy modernity mid summarized cile rives administrator conciergerie,peopl mind conciergeri pari remain last home mari antoinett guillotin former prison suffer greatli lack foreign visitor pandem tri chang imag organ exhibit capabl arous interest tourist also parisian evidenc newest exhibit pari capit gastronomi middl age today behind boast titl aim show plural role pari melt pot gastronomi structur develop place power cuisin take challeng far beyond pleasur good food evid soon step impress sall de gen arm largest non religi gothic hall europ host exhibit begin banquet held king charl franc honor german roman emperor januari plethor poetic menu preserv fragment engrav marbl tabl small select period tablewar borrow louvr museum includ stuf gild rabbit eel sweeten mud stuf fig cover gold leav tendenc think french gastronomi start centuri even escoffi end centuri said bienassi historian european institut histori cultur food curat exhibit actual much older stori includ feast offer parisian municip author queen catherin medici recept citi hall celebr recoveri loui xiv seriou ill follow journey tabl power lead lunch head state cop chair fran oi holland menu draw inspir multipl region scallop normandi licqu pa calai poultri reblochon savoi corsican citru fruit pari brest discours around rich franc provinc alway exist long time pari rich transcend polit econom elit french polit central found french cuisin said bienassi real histor legitimaci speak pari gastronom capit exhibit parisian hegemoni seen sever narr thread pari citi receiv prestigi guest also laboratori concept restaur born great invent tip gastronomi modern mid summar cile rive administr conciergeri
"In central France, an African restaurant is cherished by its customers but angers its neighbors","Appreciated by the regulars of Gnama Cissé's restaurant, the smells of her kitchen inconvenience the landlords of the apartments located above, who have taken the chef to court.","In Poitiers, central France, Gnama Cissé cooks an attiéké – a dish made from cassava semolina – that is to die for. Cheese samosas, shrimp fritters, sweet potato fries, cod acras, chicken with mafé sauce, and Yassa-style fish complete the menu of her small African and Caribbean restaurant, located in the city center. An exhilarating aroma tickles the noses of the customers as soon as they enter Chez Gnama. However, the smell is not to everyone's liking.The owners of the three apartments located above the establishment took the restaurant owner to court at the end of 2022, claiming that cooking odors were spreading freely in the building, making it impossible to rent or resell the vacant apartments. In a rare move, the interim judge and his clerk visited the building in mid-January to ""smell"" the apartments. On Wednesday, March 1, the court rejected the plaintiffs' request to close the restaurant on Rue du Moulin-à-Vent.Cissé has good reason to feel ""relieved."" Opened at the end of 2020, her four-table restaurant is the culmination of her life, which began in Guinea 33 years ago. Before opening her restaurant, the young woman roamed the markets of Poitiers and the surrounding area in a van, selling African specialties. ""When are you going to open your own restaurant?,"" her regular customers asked her. Cissé then invested ""all her savings"" in this ground-floor establishment on the edge of the pedestrian district. The first letters arrived fairly quickly asking her to stop embalming the building with her ""exotic cuisine."" ""That was the beginning of a real harassment, almost racist,"" she said. ""Whether there are odors or not, what is the problem with the 'exotic' nature of my cuisine?""To ease the conflict, the restaurateur replaced her hood with a custom-made model costing €4,000. She had the air duct lined by the owner of her storefront. She even removed ""long simmering sauces"" from her menu in order to restrict the volume of scents. At the same time, a petition was launched online by loyal customers: more than 1,500 signatories expresssed their support for this mother of three with a ""long history of fighting.""Cissé arrived in France at the age of 15 with a baby and was taken in by the child welfare system. Her studies in the social and family economy sector (BTS, state diploma) then opened the doors of a neighborhood house in Poitiers, but the experience of ""referent"" – a role as a support for residents and their projects – did not lead to a job. The young woman then remembered that her Guinean cooking was appreciated by her host family. She also remembered her grandmother's recipes in the small town of Kindia: ""She taught me everything.

French cognac is flowing in American rap music,Investigation,"""I have a story for you. And not just a story but a part of our history. What is the link between the land of cognac, jazz, blues and hip hop?"" The voice-over pauses while a video shows a van moving bumpily through vineyards. On board is a cluster of Black American soldiers, all of them wearing military uniforms, with grim looks on their faces. The singer Usher (one of the top-selling artists in the early 2000s) is among them. He is also the narrator of this surprising promotional clip for the cognac brand Rémy Martin.The video, uploaded to YouTube in 2021, lasts six minutes. The visual production is reminiscent of a Hollywood blockbuster and it features the American star delivering a crash course in history between dance moves. Usher tells how the American troops who landed in France in 1917 fell in love with cognac, brought it back home and remained faithful to it from one generation to the next. ""From this gathering [between the French and Americans], something almost magical happened,"" says Usher with a broad smile. ""Each culture inspired the other.""The story he tells may be somewhat simplified, but it is nevertheless true. The brown spirit was indeed embraced on a massive scale by GIs who fought in France during the first and second world wars. ""We know Hennessy cognac was present much earlier on American soil, as early as 1794,"" explained Fabienne Moreau, the historian in charge of the brand's heritage. ""But when they came to France, the soldiers discovered a country where racial equality was institutionalized. Black jazzmen could play freely in the clubs. Cognac ended up embodying these values of equality and freedom. And it became a marker of identity: It is the anti-whisky, which was seen as the alcohol of White people.""Cognac's historical roots in the Afro-American community have benefited from an unexpected development. Since the 1990s, rappers across the Atlantic have become the most powerful advocates for this traditional alcohol from Charente, in southwestern France.The hushed world of spirits and the boisterous world of hip-hop came together for a somewhat unconventional love affair that has played a major role in cognac's revival. The United States is the leading market for this French product, an unparalleled 97% of which is sold abroad. In the US, 111.3 million bottles were sold in 2022, over half of the exports and three times more than China, its second-largest importer. Rappers have played an important role in this American triumph.",Food,story story part history link land cognac jazz blues hip hop voice pauses video shows van moving bumpily vineyards board cluster black american soldiers wearing military uniforms grim looks faces singer usher one top selling artists early among also narrator surprising promotional clip cognac brand martin video uploaded youtube lasts six minutes visual production reminiscent hollywood blockbuster features american star delivering crash course history dance moves usher tells american troops landed france fell love cognac brought back home remained faithful one generation next gathering french americans something almost magical happened says usher broad smile culture inspired story tells may somewhat simplified nevertheless true brown spirit indeed embraced massive scale gis fought france first second world wars know hennessy cognac present much earlier american soil early explained fabienne moreau historian charge brands heritage came france soldiers discovered country racial equality institutionalized black jazzmen could play freely clubs cognac ended embodying values equality freedom became marker identity anti whisky seen alcohol white people cognacs historical roots afro american community benefited unexpected development since rappers across atlantic become powerful advocates traditional alcohol charente southwestern france hushed world spirits boisterous world hip hop came together somewhat unconventional love affair played major role cognacs revival united states leading market french product unparalleled sold abroad million bottles sold half exports three times china second largest importer rappers played important role american triumph,stori stori part histori link land cognac jazz blue hip hop voic paus video show van move bumpili vineyard board cluster black american soldier wear militari uniform grim look face singer usher one top sell artist earli among also narrat surpris promot clip cognac brand martin video upload youtub last six minut visual product reminisc hollywood blockbust featur american star deliv crash cours histori danc move usher tell american troop land franc fell love cognac brought back home remain faith one gener next gather french american someth almost magic happen say usher broad smile cultur inspir stori tell may somewhat simplifi nevertheless true brown spirit inde embrac massiv scale gi fought franc first second world war know hennessi cognac present much earlier american soil earli explain fabienn moreau historian charg brand heritag came franc soldier discov countri racial equal institution black jazzmen could play freeli club cognac end embodi valu equal freedom becam marker ident anti whiski seen alcohol white peopl cognac histor root afro american commun benefit unexpect develop sinc rapper across atlant becom power advoc tradit alcohol charent southwestern franc hush world spirit boister world hip hop came togeth somewhat unconvent love affair play major role cognac reviv unit state lead market french product unparallel sold abroad million bottl sold half export three time china second largest import rapper play import role american triumph
"Maxime Frédéric, an exceptional pastry chef",Profile,"Lined up with preciosity under glass cloches, Louis Vuitton eclairs, meringue tarts with checkerboard patterns reminiscent of the trunks, and chocolate desserts decorated with the famous monogram attract an eclectic crowd every day on the second floor of LV Dream. The Parisian exhibition space was opened by the luxury house in December 2022 on the Pont-Neuf, in place of the former Conforama store.There is nothing radically new in this concept of a café-chocolate shop launched by a fashion brand. Armani, Prada and Ralph Lauren already tried it several years ago. The view of the Seine and the iconic saffron-colored boxes that hold the delicacies are sure to delight the eye. But the signature of pastry chef Maxime Frédéric, displayed in large letters above the display case on a background of white tropical foliage, has generated a frenzy.At just 33 years old, the Normandy native, named best pastry chef of the year in 2022 by the Gault & Millau guide, is now head pastry chef of the three restaurants at the Cheval Blanc, the luxury hotel into which LVMH has transformed the floors of the Samaritaine. His millefeuille, which took him nearly two years to design, won the Madeleine prize from the jury at the Fou de Pâtisserie awards. ""We've already tasted thousands of millefeuilles,"" commented Julie Mathieu, editor-in-chief of Fou de Pâtisserie magazine. ""This one, however, managed to surprise us and today embodies the most accomplished expression of French patisserie.""Reinterpreting the classics, the prodigy is known more for his obsession with taste than his concern for appearances. On his 145,000-subscriber Instagram account, there are no viral videos of dough kneading and joyful glazing set to a musical backdrop, the trademark of pastry chef Cédric Grolet. Maxime Frédéric, whose sense of teamwork is emphasized by everyone, prefers to highlight his team, and the intricate detailing of his rocking horse-shaped Christmas yule log evokes more the aesthetics of savoir-faire and excellence than that of TikTok.Maxime Frédéric is a man of the soil and proudly showcases his Normandy heritage. Since harnessing his countryman's sense and focusing on a reinterpreted rusticity – rice pudding appears as a mignardise on the menu at Plénitude, the three-starred restaurant of chef Arnaud Donckele at the Cheval Blanc – his fame has soared. The pastry chef even dreams of cultivating the land on his own farm.In the meantime, with his sister, Noémie, and his partner, Claire, he has revitalized his grandparents' farm in Tourville-sur-Sienne (Manche, Normandy), with hazelnut production and heritage chicken farming. Their exceptional eggs supply the kitchens of Cheval Blanc and those of other chefs, such as Bernard Pacaud, of L'Ambroisie, and Jean-François Piège, who uses them for the blancmange, the floating island he has reworked at the Grand Restaurant.",Food,lined preciosity glass cloches louis vuitton eclairs meringue tarts checkerboard patterns reminiscent trunks chocolate desserts decorated famous monogram attract eclectic crowd every day second floor dream parisian exhibition space opened luxury house december pont neuf place former conforama store nothing radically new concept caf chocolate shop launched fashion brand armani prada ralph lauren already tried several years ago view seine iconic saffron colored boxes hold delicacies sure delight eye signature pastry chef maxime ric displayed large letters display case background white tro foliage generated frenzy years old normandy native named best pastry chef year gault millau guide head pastry chef three restaurants cheval blanc luxury hotel lvmh transformed floors samaritaine millefeuille took nearly two years design madeleine prize jury fou tisserie awards weve already tasted thousands millefeuilles commented julie mathieu editor chief fou tisserie magazine one however managed surprise today embodies accomplished expression french patisserie reinterpreting classics prodigy known obsession taste concern appearances subscriber instagram account viral videos dough kneading joyful glazing set musical backdrop trademark pastry chef dric grolet maxime ric whose sense teamwork emphasized everyone prefers highlight team intricate detailing rocking horse shaped christmas yule log evokes aesthetics savoir faire excellence tiktok maxime ric man soil proudly showcases normandy heritage since harnessing countrymans sense focusing reinterpreted rusticity rice pudding appears mignardise menu nitude three starred restaurant chef arnaud donckele cheval blanc fame soared pastry chef even dreams cultivating land farm meantime sister mie partner claire revitalized grandparents farm tourville sur sienne manche normandy hazelnut production heritage chicken farming exceptional eggs supply kitchens cheval blanc chefs bernard pacaud lambroisie jean fran ois uses blancmange floating island reworked grand restaurant,line precios glass cloch loui vuitton eclair meringu tart checkerboard pattern reminisc trunk chocol dessert decor famou monogram attract eclect crowd everi day second floor dream parisian exhibit space open luxuri hous decemb pont neuf place former conforama store noth radic new concept caf chocol shop launch fashion brand armani prada ralph lauren alreadi tri sever year ago view sein icon saffron color box hold delicaci sure delight eye signatur pastri chef maxim ric display larg letter display case background white tro foliag gener frenzi year old normandi nativ name best pastri chef year gault millau guid head pastri chef three restaur cheval blanc luxuri hotel lvmh transform floor samaritain millefeuil took nearli two year design madelein prize juri fou tisseri award weve alreadi tast thousand millefeuil comment juli mathieu editor chief fou tisseri magazin one howev manag surpris today embodi accomplish express french patisseri reinterpret classic prodigi known obsess tast concern appear subscrib instagram account viral video dough knead joy glaze set music backdrop trademark pastri chef dric grolet maxim ric whose sens teamwork emphas everyon prefer highlight team intric detail rock hors shape christma yule log evok aesthet savoir fair excel tiktok maxim ric man soil proudli showcas normandi heritag sinc har countryman sens focus reinterpret rustic rice pud appear mignardis menu nitud three star restaur chef arnaud donckel cheval blanc fame soar pastri chef even dream cultiv land farm meantim sister mie partner clair revit grandpar farm tourvil sur sienn manch normandi hazelnut product heritag chicken farm except egg suppli kitchen cheval blanc chef bernard pacaud lambroisi jean fran oi use blancmang float island rework grand restaur
'Drops of God': The intoxicating manga that rocked the world of wine,"    Launched nearly 20 years ago, the Japanese saga is coming to Apple TV+ as a mini-series on April 21. It has changed the way we talk about wine and even affected the destiny of certain wineries. ","Just like droplets that flow together to create vast rivers, Drops of God, a Japanese manga imagined by a brother and sister some 20 years ago, to present the wines they tasted, became a 44-volume saga and a worldwide triumph. It also changed the destiny of several wineries along the way. Now they are being adapted for TV as a French miniseries, available on video-on-demand on Apple TV+ starting April 21.The work is a true ode to the nectar of the vine. This, for example, is how a Chevalier-Montrachet, 2000 vintage, from Michel Colin-Deléger, is described in volume 18 of Drops of God: ""There is an austerity to this wine that doesn't let those who treat it imprudently approach it. But despite... no, precisely because of this, we cannot help but feel immeasurable expectations. Because at the summit that bliss that will never disappoint us inevitably awaits. An all-embracing emotion – fear, despair, sorrow – which draws us up towards joy, is certainly waiting for us there. The essence of this wine is the 'test.' And what we can only taste when we have mastered it, an immense sense of accomplishment.""The manga, published in France between 2008 and 2016 by Glénat, evoked some 700 wines over 439 episodes. All of them are described in a vivid, poetic manner, immersing the reader in a unique world for each label tasted (in the case of the Chevalier-Montrachet, the ascent of the Matterhorn Mountain accompanies the description). Most of the wines are French, but there are also Italian, Spanish, Californian, Australian and Japanese vintages. The pair of writers – who sign under the pseudonym Tadashi Agi – tasted all the wines in order to translate them into words, before the artist Shu Okimoto herself would get involved.And so, a comic book intended primarily for well-versed readers has become a colossal success in France, with 1.4 million copies sold. 15 million were sold worldwide. It also marks a turning point: ""Drops of God opened the door for seinen in France, the manga for young adults,"" said Satoko Inaba, editorial director of Glénat Manga. ""Until then, this literary genre had been wrongly associated with a teenage audience, with action stories, often violent.""Above all, no book had dared tackle wine with such proud lyricism. ""Fiction in France tends to focus on the storyline, whereas manga is based on the characters and their emotions, shared with the reader,"" said the Glénat publisher. ""It is therefore an excellent medium to talk about wine. And since the essence of manga is also to popularize, to reach the widest audience, we learn a lot when reading Drops of God. But it's also dangerous, because after reading it, all you want to do is go drink wine!""",Food,like droplets flow together create vast rivers drops god japanese manga imagined brother sister years ago present wines tasted became volume saga worldwide triumph also changed destiny several wineries along way adapted french miniseries available video demand apple starting april work true ode nectar vine example chevalier montrachet vintage michel colin del ger described volume drops god austerity wine doesnt let treat imprudently approach despite precisely help feel immeasurable expectations summit bliss never disappoint inevitably awaits embracing emotion fear despair sorrow draws towards joy certainly waiting essence wine test taste mastered immense sense accomplishment manga published france nat evoked wines episodes described vivid poetic manner immersing reader unique world label tasted case chevalier montrachet ascent matterhorn mountain accompanies description wines french also italian spanish californian australian japanese vintages pair writers sign pseudonym tadashi agi tasted wines order translate words artist shu okimoto would get involved comic book intended primarily well versed readers become colossal success france million copies sold million sold worldwide also marks turning point drops god opened door seinen france manga young adults said satoko inaba editorial director nat manga literary genre wrongly associated teenage audience action stories often violent book dared tackle wine proud lyricism fiction france tends focus storyline whereas manga based characters emotions shared reader said nat publisher therefore excellent medium talk wine since essence manga also popularize reach widest audience learn lot reading drops god also dangerous reading want drink wine,like droplet flow togeth creat vast river drop god japanes manga imagin brother sister year ago present wine tast becam volum saga worldwid triumph also chang destini sever wineri along way adapt french miniseri avail video demand appl start april work true ode nectar vine exampl chevali montrachet vintag michel colin del ger describ volum drop god auster wine doesnt let treat imprud approach despit precis help feel immeasur expect summit bliss never disappoint inevit await embrac emot fear despair sorrow draw toward joy certainli wait essenc wine test tast master immens sens accomplish manga publish franc nat evok wine episod describ vivid poetic manner immers reader uniqu world label tast case chevali montrachet ascent matterhorn mountain accompani descript wine french also italian spanish californian australian japanes vintag pair writer sign pseudonym tadashi agi tast wine order translat word artist shu okimoto would get involv comic book intend primarili well vers reader becom coloss success franc million copi sold million sold worldwid also mark turn point drop god open door seinen franc manga young adult said satoko inaba editori director nat manga literari genr wrongli associ teenag audienc action stori often violent book dare tackl wine proud lyric fiction franc tend focu storylin wherea manga base charact emot share reader said nat publish therefor excel medium talk wine sinc essenc manga also popular reach widest audienc learn lot read drop god also danger read want drink wine
"Tony Parker talks wine: 'I've always loved rosé – for me, it's associated with memories of vacations'","    The former NBA star owns his own vineyard in Provence, and now he's invested in the Château La Mascaronne to create a high-quality rosé. ","Tony Parker is regarded as the greatest French basketball player of all time. From 2001 to 2018, he played for the San Antonio Spurs in Texas and won four NBA championships, being named the Most Valuable Player at the 2007 finals. The 40-year-old point guard will be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in August, cementing his legacy in the game.Parker has told his story in a book, Beyond All Of My Dreams (Solar/L'Equipe, 2019), and in the documentary Tony Parker: The Final Shot, which was aired on Netflix in 2020. Born in Bruges to an American basketball player father and a Dutch model mother, Parker held his first basketball at the age of three. He led the French national team to victory in the 2013 European Championships. He has been the president of the ASVEL Lyon-Villeurbanne basketball club since 2014 and is the founder of the Tony Parker Adéquat Academy in Lyon, and, as of this year, an Adidas ambassador. He has also recently expanded his business ventures in the wine industry, investing in Château La Mascaronne to create a high-quality rosé.I consider myself lucky because 1982 was a fantastic vintage for wine. Whenever I visit a Bordeaux château, I request a bottle from that year, and I've been fortunate enough to sample many of the best wines from 1982. The Château Angelus 1982 from Saint-Émilion is a standout – it has aged beautifully and I loved everything about it. The Château Cos d'Estournel 1982 from Saint-Estèphe was also incredible. And then, there's the legendary Pétrus 1982 from Pomerol. I'm thrilled to have some of these exceptional wines in my own cellar.I'm an avid wine drinker, but I don't collect bottles – I purchase them to enjoy. I have 1,500 bottles to share with friends; I consider myself a lover of the good life. In France, we're fortunate to have access to exceptional wine, and I take advantage of that. I celebrate every major achievement in my basketball career with a bottle of wine – often great Bordeaux wines, which are my favorite. I'm also learning to appreciate Burgundies and wines from the Provence region. However, if I had to choose, Bordeaux would be my top pick.I've been offered opportunities to invest in wine in California but for me, wine is primarily associated with France. It's a reference point, I don't want to disrespect the Spanish, Italian, or Californian winemakers.

Taiwan and the fusion of world cuisine,"The island's cuisine offers a rich palette of flavors, textures and dishes with roots in the Netherlands, Japan and, of course, China. It makes for a delightful experience.","Until now, I didn't know anything about Taiwanese cuisine. Nada, walou. I just knew where to stick a pin on a map for the country: a large island in East Asia, roughly four times the size of Corsica, located off the coast of China, north of the Philippines and south of Japan. And then, one sleepless night, it unexpectedly offered itself up to me in a way that was as delicious as it was direct. It was one o'clock in the morning, my eyelids were heavy, my stomach was empty and I'd just started replaying Eat Drink Man Woman on the Arte website. This third film by famous Taiwanese director Ang Lee was released in 1994 and nominated the following year for the Oscar for best foreign language film.The opening scene completely drew me in and I'm still salivating over it to this day. It's daytime and the camera has entered the kitchen of an elderly man wearing an apron, his sleeves rolled up. For six long minutes, we watch as he prepares a meal, the lens zooming in on his skilled hands, examining his every move. In the middle of a tiled wall, the movements of various utensils (ladles, a colander, bamboo baskets, an enormous array of sharp knives) above a wok gradually allow us to hear the sizzling sound of ingredients cooking. For a moment, the smell of cooking seems to pass right through the screen and into my nose. The color of the food changes before my very eyes and I can almost imagine what its texture feels like. In fact, I am witnessing the creation of several typical Taiwanese dishes as if I were right there in the same room instead of on the other side of the screen. And at this late hour of the night nothing can make me want to start cooking more.To achieve this masterful sequence, which required more than a week of shooting, Lee used three professional chefs. The main actor, Sihung Lung, had to be trained how to use the utensils. The film begins like this: A pair of hands immersed in a fish tank catches a fish. Using a pair of chopsticks, the chef immobilizes the animal and then guts it on a block. After lifting out the fillets, he crisscrosses the flesh with a knife. Once floured, the fish is transformed by being dunked into a bath of boiling oil, before being returned to room temperature. The man then removes two beautiful pieces of pork belly from a dark marinade, fries them and puts them in a bowl filled with ice cubes. He delicately slices several thin, juicy-looking strips of meat and puts them in the bottom of a bowl with spring onions, sugar and star anise. A few seconds later, the concoction disappears underneath the lid of a large, steaming basket. The cook then goes to his yard in search of a chicken. After an interval, the chicken has been plucked and is ready to simmer inside a terracotta pot, in a broth that we can assume is thick and intensely flavorful.",Food,didnt know anything taiwanese cuisine nada walou knew stick pin map country large island east asia roughly four times size corsica located coast china north philippines south japan one sleepless night unexpectedly offered way delicious direct one oclock morning eyelids heavy stomach empty started replaying eat drink man woman arte website third film famous taiwanese director ang lee released nominated following year oscar best foreign language film opening scene completely drew still salivating day daytime camera entered kitchen elderly man wearing apron sleeves rolled six long minutes watch prepares meal lens zooming skilled hands examining every move middle tiled wall movements various utensils ladles colander bamboo baskets enormous array sharp knives wok gradually allow hear sizzling sound ingredients cooking moment smell cooking seems pass right screen nose color food changes eyes almost imagine texture feels like fact witnessing creation several taiwanese dishes right room instead side screen late hour night nothing make want start cooking achieve masterful sequence required week shooting lee used three professional chefs main actor sihung lung trained use utensils film begins like pair hands immersed fish tank catches fish using pair chopsticks chef immobilizes animal guts block lifting fillets crisscrosses flesh knife floured fish transformed dunked bath boiling oil returned room temperature man removes two beautiful pieces pork belly dark marinade fries puts bowl filled ice cubes delicately slices several thin juicy looking strips meat puts bottom bowl spring onions sugar star anise seconds later concoction disappears underneath lid large steaming basket cook goes yard search chicken interval chicken plucked ready simmer inside terracotta pot broth assume thick intensely flavorful,didnt know anyth taiwanes cuisin nada walou knew stick pin map countri larg island east asia roughli four time size corsica locat coast china north philippin south japan one sleepless night unexpectedli offer way delici direct one oclock morn eyelid heavi stomach empti start replay eat drink man woman art websit third film famou taiwanes director ang lee releas nomin follow year oscar best foreign languag film open scene complet drew still saliv day daytim camera enter kitchen elderli man wear apron sleev roll six long minut watch prepar meal len zoom skill hand examin everi move middl tile wall movement variou utensil ladl coland bamboo basket enorm array sharp knive wok gradual allow hear sizzl sound ingredi cook moment smell cook seem pass right screen nose color food chang eye almost imagin textur feel like fact wit creation sever taiwanes dish right room instead side screen late hour night noth make want start cook achiev master sequenc requir week shoot lee use three profession chef main actor sihung lung train use utensil film begin like pair hand immers fish tank catch fish use pair chopstick chef immobil anim gut block lift fillet crisscross flesh knife flour fish transform dunk bath boil oil return room temperatur man remov two beauti piec pork belli dark marinad fri put bowl fill ice cube delic slice sever thin juici look strip meat put bottom bowl spring onion sugar star anis second later concoct disappear underneath lid larg steam basket cook goe yard search chicken interv chicken pluck readi simmer insid terracotta pot broth assum thick intens flavor
From car trunks to supermarket trolleys: the real street food of Paris,"    Street food might be taking over restaurant menus, but the real thing, sold for a pittance from makeshift facilities, is an underground economy that allows immigrants to survive. ","The Sunday afternoon Spanish-language mass had barely finished at this Paris church, when a car pulled up at the edge of the square. A couple got out and opened the trunk, which was filled with interesting things to eat like empanadas (savory pasties, filled with meat and vegetables) and pan de queso (cheese bread).As the congregation left mass, a line formed behind the vehicle to pick up a cafecito (""small coffee"") and a pasteleria (""pastry"") to enjoy there, as well as food to take home. Everyone knew each other and gathered around the couple; Diana and Nelson (their first names have been changed), Colombians in their fifties. Like many of their customers, they left Colombia for Spain in the 2000s to find a better life. But the 2008 financial crisis hit their host country hard. They resettled in Paris in 2012. They began selling their homemade dishes outside the churches attended by their compatriots, as well as making home deliveries.While most of the customers are Colombian, there are also Peruvians, Ecuadorians, and a few French people. ""We're loyal to them because it's food we don't see here. But it's also a way to build a community with Latinos. By buying their food, we're supporting them,"" said 39-year-old Carmen. We took a first bite of a pan de queso, designed to be eaten on the go, on the street or at home. We'd buy more, but to our frustration the crates were empty within 20 minutes. A new customer arrived. Nelson struck up conversation: ""We've run out! Where are you from?"" The young man replied proudly that he was Venezuelan.Diana and Nelson work underground. In France, itinerant sales – known as au déballage – are prohibited, and incur a penalty of €15,000 (Article L. 310-5 of the Commercial Code). Along with many other street vendors in major French cities, they are representatives of an authentic street food culture, directly imported from countries where setting up a wobbly stall on a street corner or roadside is tradition. This is the case in all the Latin American countries, as well as those of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, for instance.In the Paris neighborhood of Belleville, elderly ladies sat and opened their carts filled with sauces, peanuts and dumplings outside the specialist Asian food outlet, Paris Store.

That's unconscionable,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. It was ""a stinging indictment of humanity's failure to make progress... to end hunger, and achieve food security and improved nutrition for all,"" he said.More than 40% of those in serious need of food lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Yemen, the UN report said.""Conflicts and mass displacement continue to drive global hunger,"" Guterres said. ""Rising poverty, deepening inequalities, rampant underdevelopment, the climate crisis and natural disasters also contribute to food insecurity.""In 2022, 258 million people faced high levels of acute food insecurity in 58 countries or territories, up from 193 million in 53 countries the previous year, the report said.

Israel has become a new promised land for winegrowers,"    Since 2000, Israeli wine production has experienced strong growth and moved upmarket. In 2022, the creation of its first appellation, Judean Hills, was a crowning moment for producers in search of their own identity. ","The history of Israeli wine is very old but chaotic, with long stretches of inactivity and a few rebirths linked to its complicated past and the successive conflicts of recent decades. Like in neighboring Lebanon, traces of wine production can be found well before our era, including vestiges of over 2,000-year-old wine presses, but vines laid dormant for centuries following Islam's arrival in Palestine. Only in the second half of the 19th century did the wine industry begin to structure itself with the support of Baron James de Rothschild (1792-1868), but this momentum was quickly destroyed by phylloxera. In the 1950s, the sector rebounded when European winegrowers settled and built a few large wine-growing entities. The final stage began with the creation of small estates, first at the end of the 1980s and then especially at the turn of the millennium, which breathed new life into the industry.This history has led to a contrasting viticultural landscape, with on one side a ""big five"" – Carmel, Barkan, Golan Heights, Teperberg and Binyamina – accounting for 80% of all production, and on the other some 300 wineries, many of which were created just 20 or 30 years ago. Production is in line with the scale of a country twice the size of the Ile-de-France region: 8,000 hectares and 40 million bottles per year – by comparison, France produces well over a hundred times more.Vineyards have fled the hot plains and their dry soils for the hills at higher altitudes to seek cooler temperatures. Most of them are located in northern Israel near the Lebanese border, where the Galilee highlands are swept by the breezes from Mount Hermon. Not far away, the Golan Heights and its water-rich mountains are home to a few hundred hectares of plantations. A handful of estates are also present in the southern Negev region, at least where the land lies between 500 and 1,000 meters above sea level. In 2022, they applied for an appellation to have their wines' uniqueness recognized.And then there is Judea. Here, in the hills of Jerusalem in central Israel, is where the country's wine renaissance is happening. As a symbol, its producers obtained in August 2020 the country's first official appellation, Judean Hills, produced by passionate winemakers heading small private wineries, some of which have gained worldwide notoriety.One of the pioneers of this revival is Eli Ben Zaken, the bright-eyed, white-haired and patriarchal-bearded figurehead of the Judean wine industry with his Domaine du Castel, located on a hill near Jerusalem. In a book released in February, Domaine du Castel. The Biography, journalist Adam S. Montefiore tells the story of this winemaker and his estate that have contributed to spreading Israeli wine's recognition beyond its borders.",Food,history israeli wine old chaotic long stretches inactivity rebirths linked complicated past successive conflicts recent decades like neighboring lebanon traces wine production found well era including vestiges year old wine presses vines laid dormant centuries following islams arrival palestine second half century wine industry begin structure support baron james rothschild momentum quickly destroyed phylloxera sector rebounded european winegrowers settled built large wine growing entities final stage began creation small estates first end especially turn millennium breathed new life industry history led contrasting viticultural landscape one side big five carmel barkan golan heights teperberg binyamina accounting production wineries many created years ago production line scale country twice size ile france region hectares million bottles per year comparison france produces well hundred times vineyards fled hot plains dry soils hills higher altitudes seek cooler temperatures located northern israel near lebanese border galilee highlands swept breezes mount hermon far away golan heights water rich mountains home hundred hectares plantations handful estates also present southern negev region least land lies meters sea level applied appellation wines uniqueness recognized judea hills jerusalem central israel countrys wine renaissance happening symbol producers obtained august countrys first official appellation judean hills produced passionate winemakers heading small private wineries gained worldwide notoriety one pioneers revival eli ben zaken bright eyed white haired patriarchal bearded figurehead judean wine industry domaine castel located hill near jerusalem book released february domaine castel biography journalist adam montefiore tells story winemaker estate contributed spreading israeli wines recognition beyond borders,histori isra wine old chaotic long stretch inact rebirth link complic past success conflict recent decad like neighbor lebanon trace wine product found well era includ vestig year old wine press vine laid dormant centuri follow islam arriv palestin second half centuri wine industri begin structur support baron jame rothschild momentum quickli destroy phylloxera sector rebound european winegrow settl built larg wine grow entiti final stage began creation small estat first end especi turn millennium breath new life industri histori led contrast viticultur landscap one side big five carmel barkan golan height teperberg binyamina account product wineri mani creat year ago product line scale countri twice size ile franc region hectar million bottl per year comparison franc produc well hundr time vineyard fled hot plain dri soil hill higher altitud seek cooler temperatur locat northern israel near lebanes border galile highland swept breez mount hermon far away golan height water rich mountain home hundr hectar plantat hand estat also present southern negev region least land lie meter sea level appli appel wine uniqu recogn judea hill jerusalem central israel countri wine renaiss happen symbol produc obtain august countri first offici appel judean hill produc passion winemak head small privat wineri gain worldwid notorieti one pioneer reviv eli ben zaken bright eye white hair patriarch beard figurehead judean wine industri domain castel locat hill near jerusalem book releas februari domain castel biographi journalist adam montefior tell stori winemak estat contribut spread isra wine recognit beyond border
"After K-pop, K-food is conquering France","    With its decorated dalgona candy and its kimbap rice and vegetable rolls, Korean food is making is becoming a fixture. ","Walking through the door of the Kick Café in the center of Paris, one gets the feeling of entering a gigantic box of sweets. Candy pink walls, white chocolate pastries disguised as lollipops, shortbreads shaped like teddy bears, blue, green, purple cocktails topped with whipped cream, cookie powder and cotton candy syrup. It's an accumulation of glucose that would make Hansel and Gretel's gingerbread house jealous. The boutique café is the headquarters of K-pop fans. Moreover, at the back of the room, near cardboard silhouettes of stars, groupies in their twenties were blowing up balloons while munching on sesame cakes, currently the trend in Seoul. Their favorite band, CIX, was due to play at the Bataclan the next day. And it is here that music lovers from Orléans, Lille or Metz have chosen to meet to celebrate the event.Singers and fans are not the only ones to stop by the Kick Café. A little over a year ago, the establishment welcomed Korean Culture Minister, Hwang Hee, who came to meet French K-pop fans. ""I feel very supported by the country's institutions,"" said the café's founder, Savannah Truong, 28, with a broad smile. She is assisted by the Korean Cultural Center, the embassy, Kocca (the agency for the promotion of trade and investment), and Kotra (the agency for creative content). ""In November 2022, Kotra even paid for my trip to Seoul to learn about local coffees and products I could import."" After publishing a book about her homemade cocktails, K-pop Drinks (Hachette, 2022), the young boss feels supported enough to open another café in London this year. ""I want to open 10 around the world!"" she said without blinking.In France, cafés celebrating Korean culture have already spread: Joha Café in Lille, Café 750 in Bordeaux, Kiwa Café in Lyon. There are colorful pastries and oddities like bungeoppang, a fish-shaped cake filled with sweetened red bean paste. The number of Korean restaurants has also soared. According to the French-Korean media Francezone, they have increased from 40 to 200 in Paris alone in 20 years. In addition, there are more than 80 establishments in the rest of France.It's not a massive increase, but it's a big wave that has not happened by chance. K-food is a tool of the country's soft power. The flagship of this influence campaign, the K-food Festival, is a gastronomic festival funded by the Korean Ministry of Agriculture which took place in July 2022 at Le Carrousel du Louvre, a symbolic location. There, visitors could learn how to make kimbap (a kind of rice roll filled with vegetables) and line up with hundreds of fans – most of them under 25 years old – to nibble on skewers coated with sweet and sour sauce or bingsu (a dessert made of crushed ice and red beans).It would be wrong to dismiss the adolescent enthusiasm surrounding K-food because it has many assets to invite itself permanently onto our tables. First of all, it is inseparable from Korean pop culture, which is itself very powerful. ""In music videos, TV shows and Korean movies, the stars eat all the time,"" said Korean-born Walloon chef Sang Hoon Degeimbre, who has become an ambassador for the cuisine of his native country. ""And their fans imitate them, all over the world.""Following the global success of Squid Game, the recipe for dalgonas, caramels decorated with heart or umbrella designs that appear in the series, has gone viral. Meanwhile, director Bong Joon-ho's 2019 Palme d'Or winner Parasite has boosted sales of jjapaguri, an instant noodle dish prepared in the film.Another strength is that Korean cuisine is based on fermentation, which has made a comeback in high-end restaurants. Sang Hoon Degeimbre uses his country's ancestral techniques in his two-star restaurant L'Air du Temps in Liernu, in the Belgian province of Namur. ""Our farm is in the middle of five hectares of vegetables,"" explained the chef. ""In winter, we serve them fermented, Korean style. We make pickles (jang-a-jji), soy sauce (ganjang), chili paste (gochujang).""The Walloon chef's table also includes kimchi, a mainstay of Korean cuisine, a powerful lacto-fermented mixture made from cabbage, chili and garlic. In France, William Ledeuil was one of the first Michelin-starred chefs to use it. ""It allowed me to replace salt and pepper, which I try to stop using. I can use it as a condiment that adds a fragrant note,"" he explained in his Ze Kitchen Galerie restaurant, one of the most renowned Asian-inspired eateries in Paris.Pierre Sang, born in Korea and adopted at the age of 7 by a family in the Haute-Loire, has also contributed to familiarizing the French palette with Korean flavors. He uses kimchi to give ""pep"" to his dishes, especially the green lentils of Puy, a tribute to his adopted roots. His menu is very affordable: In his restaurant, the vegetarian bibimbap (a rice-based mixture, here enriched with lentils) is sold for €12.This is the other great strength of K-food: its accessibility. ""The country, which has had a very low standard of living for a long time, has remained faithful to 'poor people's dishes' from the vegetable garden,"" explained Sang Hoon Degeimbre. ""The Buddhist and vegetarian influence is still felt. And some street food is very popular."" Dong Né, a tiny Korean canteen in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, with a monastic decor (no posters or paintings, just a few wooden tables facing the open kitchen), is a good example.The first menu, priced at €15, contains three delicious plates, each of which is enough for a full meal. On the menu, a variety of kimbaps, Korean rolls prepared before our eyes, containing carrots, cucumbers and radishes wrapped in a ring of rice (held together by a ribbon of dried seaweed). Then come the tteokbokki, sticks of rice flour dough dipped in a very spicy sauce. And finally, the fried sweet potato noodles. The freshness, the variety of textures and the range of flavors, from sweet to spicy, make it a very good meal at a very reasonable price, especially since the cooks can prepare dishes without animal protein.The conquest of French taste buds has been achieved more recently through a clever fusion with French cuisine, often subtle. At Perception, a new Parisian restaurant, located near Pigalle, whose dining room is similar to a black box, the menu is not immediately distinguishable from that of a bistro-type establishment. Except that the beet pie is spiced up with bokbunja (black raspberry fermentation), the sesame salmon comes to life with Korean celery pickles and the chocolate ice cream is flavored with nori seaweed.""I wanted to bring as many people together as possible and for them to realize my influences only after they've eaten,"" explained Sukwon Yong in the kitchen. After training in Korea and perfecting his skills at the international Le Cordon Bleu network of schools, the chef honed his French recipes with William Ledeuil, who helped him move to France. ""The differences in technique between our cuisines are important,"" explained Sukwon Yong. ""Meat or fish stocks don't exist in Korea. But there are also similarities. The flavors are varied, we like condiments and we take our time. For some game dishes, I can marinate the meat for 48 hours!""At Octave, a stone's throw from the Trocadero in Paris, the Franco-Korean marriage reaches new heights of refinement. Owner Juliette Ju, born in Seoul but living in France for the past 23 years, has an impressive culinary resume, including stints with Joël Robuchon and William Ledeuil (him again). Don't be fooled by the discreet atmosphere of her gourmet restaurant, with its minimalist décor, tulips on the tables and sweet jazz melodies – the chef and her cuisine have character.To whet the appetite, guests are invited to squeeze a pipette of spicy soy sauce onto a vegetable ravioli before an exquisitely delicate foie gras makes its appearance. ""The liver has been marinated in miso,"" she explained. ""I use this soy paste as a seasoning instead of salt."" The rest is full of delights and surprises, like a mussel broth where grilled scallops splash around with green algae and a trio of cabbages (pointed, romanesco and Brussels sprouts). The Korean chef knows how to sublimate French dishes. The versatility of K-food seems to bring gourmets together and will prolong the ""trend"" for a few more centuries.",Food,walking door kick caf center paris one gets feeling entering gigantic box

Hiroshima's sake wants to conquer the world,"    The prestigious Sempuku house has released a special brew for the G7 summit held in Japan. In response to declining alcohol sales in the archipelago, producers are betting on exports. ","For Hiroshima, the G7 summit scheduled from May 19 to 21 isn't merely a gathering of world leaders confined within the Prince Hotel at the edge of Ujina Island. It's also an opportunity to highlight the culinary gems of the eponymous prefecture in southwestern Japan, starting with its sakes. While it isn't the top sake producer in Japan – a title held by Niigata in the north of the archipelago – it prides itself on a distinctive terroir and continues to be a stronghold of innovation, leading notably to the creation of the highly esteemed ginjo sake (made from rice that's polished to at least 60%). They are eager to make this known to the world.The esteemed Sempuku brewery has, in response, unveiled a special edition sake – a sweet, easy-to-drink variety, best served chilled and bearing the G7 label – which might feature on the tasting menu for the attending world leaders. ""We're crossing our fingers,"" said Kiyotsugu Miyake, the sixth of his name, the dynamic and eloquent leader of the sake brewery nestled in the heights of Kure, a major military port located roughly 20 kilometers south of Hiroshima.Sempuku boasts an annual production of approximately 1.4 million liters of a variety of sakes, ranging from futsushu, or everyday sake, to junmai daiginjo, the most refined type. Established in 1856, the company thrived thanks to the naval activities and its arsenal set up in the late 19th century. ""In 1920, our Kuretsuru sake was brought aboard the Asama cruiser. After 220 days at sea, journeying through South Africa and Latin America, it remained unspoiled. It was then designated as the official sake of the naval bases,"" said Miyake, who is always eager to share the story of the resilient family business that survived the 1945 American bombings and the 2001 earthquake that partially destroyed its facilities.Sempuku is one of the main kura (a nickname given to sake producers) in Hiroshima, which are found in Kure as well as in the city of Higashi-Hiroshima, where eight establishments of the Saijo Association maintain their activity in a neighborhood with old-time charm, featuring buildings with white walls highlighted by dark wood and covered with black tiles, topped with red brick chimneys.These large companies are neighbors to smaller producers like Morikawa. The company, which still adheres to traditional methods, produces 45,000 liters per year in its premises adorned with a pleasant Japanese garden, located at the entrance of a hamlet in the heart of a vast plain of rice fields. Here, the sake is ""rather light, ideal to complement a meal,"" explained Tomonori Morikawa, head of the family business. This is due to the water that flows from Mount Noro, which overlooks the valley. ""It is very soft, without calcium or magnesium and with very little iron. It lacks some minerals to feed the fungi, but we have a special method to compensate,"" explained Motoharu Morikawa, in charge of sake-making – two fermentations with the addition of fungi and yeasts.",Food,hiroshima summit scheduled may isnt merely gathering world leaders confined within prince hotel edge ujina island also opportunity highlight culinary gems eponymous prefecture southwestern japan starting sakes isnt top sake producer japan title held niigata north archipelago prides distinctive terroir continues stronghold innovation leading notably creation highly esteemed ginjo sake made rice thats polished least eager make known world esteemed sempuku brewery response unveiled special edition sake sweet easy drink variety best served chilled bearing label might feature tasting menu attending world leaders crossing fingers said kiyotsugu miyake sixth name dynamic eloquent leader sake brewery nestled heights kure major military port located roughly kilometers south hiroshima sempuku boasts annual production approximately million liters variety sakes ranging futsushu everyday sake junmai daiginjo refined type established company thrived thanks naval activities arsenal set late century kuretsuru sake brought aboard asama cruiser days sea journeying south africa latin america remained unspoiled designated official sake naval bases said miyake always eager share story resilient family business survived american bombings earthquake partially destroyed facilities sempuku one main kura nickname given sake producers hiroshima found kure well city higashi hiroshima eight establishments saijo association maintain activity neighborhood old time charm featuring buildings white walls highlighted dark wood covered black tiles topped red brick chimneys large companies neighbors smaller producers like morikawa company still adheres traditional methods produces liters per year premises adorned pleasant japanese garden located entrance hamlet heart vast plain rice fields sake rather light ideal complement meal explained tomonori morikawa head family business due water flows mount noro overlooks valley soft without calcium magnesium little iron lacks minerals feed fungi special method compensate explained motoharu morikawa charge sake making two fermentations addition fungi yeasts,hiroshima summit schedul may isnt mere gather world leader confin within princ hotel edg ujina island also opportun highlight culinari gem eponym prefectur southwestern japan start sake isnt top sake produc japan titl held niigata north archipelago pride distinct terroir continu stronghold innov lead notabl creation highli esteem ginjo sake made rice that polish least eager make known world esteem sempuku breweri respons unveil special edit sake sweet easi drink varieti best serv chill bear label might featur tast menu attend world leader cross finger said kiyotsugu miyak sixth name dynam eloqu leader sake breweri nestl height kure major militari port locat roughli kilomet south hiroshima sempuku boast annual product approxim million liter varieti sake rang futsushu everyday sake junmai daiginjo refin type establish compani thrive thank naval activ arsen set late centuri kuretsuru sake brought aboard asama cruiser day sea journey south africa latin america remain unspoil design offici sake naval base said miyak alway eager share stori resili famili busi surviv american bomb earthquak partial destroy facil sempuku one main kura nicknam given sake produc hiroshima found kure well citi higashi hiroshima eight establish saijo associ maintain activ neighborhood old time charm featur build white wall highlight dark wood cover black tile top red brick chimney larg compani neighbor smaller produc like morikawa compani still adher tradit method produc liter per year premis adorn pleasant japanes garden locat entranc hamlet heart vast plain rice field sake rather light ideal complement meal explain tomonori morikawa head famili busi due water flow mount noro overlook valley soft without calcium magnesium littl iron lack miner feed fungi special method compens explain motoharu morikawa charg sake make two ferment addit fungi yeast
Desperate race for water in drought-hit vineyards of southern France,Investigation,"Everything is now in place to irrigate the vineyards of Saint-Etienne-des-Sorts (southern France): the large floating pipe that draws water from the Rhône, the brand-new pumping station, and the network of black pipes that climb the slopes and deploy their sprawling drip irrigation system, row after row. Inaugurated in April, this new network supplies water to around 400 hectares of vineyards. It standardizes a practice that was previously limited to a few individual wells and makeshift setups, subject to drought restrictions every summer. In May, a large part of the region is already under reinforced alert, and the neighboring sector is in crisis.""The project has come at just the right time,"" said David Genty, vice president of l’Association du Terroir des 3 Châteaux, which brings together the 46 participating owners. Thanks to the greater abundance of water from the Rhône river, the winegrowers can avoid irrigation restrictions. ""The vines are already suffering even though we started watering in April,"" explained Genty.Despite being well-suited to hot and dry climates, this Mediterranean crop is reaching its limits with global warming. ""Vines need very little water. But even this very little, we don't have it anymore: We're missing the rains of April, the storms of July and August 15,"" said the winemaker. Irrigation is intended to compensate for this changing climate and replace the rain that no longer falls at the right time, when the vine needs to take root and bear fruit.And never mind if it increases production costs and working hours. ""It's a matter of survival. Without water, this vineyard wouldn't be replanted,"" said Genty, pointing to piles of dead vines in the middle of a cleared plot. ""We're not inflating production; we just want to maintain yields close to the AOC [controlled designation of origin] ceiling of 40 to 50 hectolitres per hectare, and guarantee quality grapes.""Harvest taking place two weeks earlier than before 1980, reduced yields due to droughts and extreme heat, vine decline, increased alcohol content, decreased acidity: The effects of climate change on vineyards are now well-documented.In its report titled ""Stratégie Face Au Changement Climatique,"" (climate change strategy) published in February, the wine industry presents irrigation as one of the adaptation measures, calling for the development of water networks and storage facilities. On the ground, in the south of France, this solution is increasingly seen as the primary response to global warming, a necessary condition for the sustainability of vineyards.",Food,everything place irrigate vineyards saint etienne des sorts southern france large floating pipe draws water brand new pumping station network black pipes climb slopes deploy sprawling drip irrigation system row row inaugurated april new network supplies water around hectares vineyards standardizes practice previously limited individual wells makeshift setups subject drought restrictions every summer may large part region already reinforced alert neighboring sector crisis project come right time said david genty vice president association terroir des teaux brings together participating owners thanks greater abundance water river winegrowers avoid irrigation restrictions vines already suffering even though started watering april explained genty despite well suited hot dry climates mediterranean crop reaching limits global warming vines need little water even little dont anymore missing rains april storms july august said winemaker irrigation intended compensate changing climate replace rain longer falls right time vine needs take root bear fruit never mind increases production costs working hours matter survival without water vineyard wouldnt replanted said genty pointing piles dead vines middle cleared plot inflating production want maintain yields close aoc controlled designation origin ceiling hectolitres per hectare guarantee quality grapes harvest taking place two weeks earlier reduced yields due droughts extreme heat vine decline increased alcohol content decreased acidity effects climate change vineyards well documented report titled strat gie face changement climatique climate change strategy published february wine industry presents irrigation one adaptation measures calling development water networks storage facilities ground south france solution increasingly seen primary response global warming necessary condition sustainability vineyards,everyth place irrig vineyard saint etienn de sort southern franc larg float pipe draw water brand new pump station network black pipe climb slope deploy sprawl drip irrig system row row inaugur april new network suppli water around hectar vineyard standard practic previous limit individu well makeshift setup subject drought restrict everi summer may larg part region alreadi reinforc alert neighbor sector crisi project come right time said david genti vice presid associ terroir de teaux bring togeth particip owner thank greater abund water river winegrow avoid irrig restrict vine alreadi suffer even though start water april explain genti despit well suit hot dri climat mediterranean crop reach limit global warm vine need littl water even littl dont anymor miss rain april storm juli august said winemak irrig intend compens chang climat replac rain longer fall right time vine need take root bear fruit never mind increas product cost work hour matter surviv without water vineyard wouldnt replant said genti point pile dead vine middl clear plot inflat product want maintain yield close aoc control design origin ceil hectolitr per hectar guarante qualiti grape harvest take place two week earlier reduc yield due drought extrem heat vine declin increas alcohol content decreas acid effect climat chang vineyard well document report titl strat gie face changement climatiqu climat chang strategi publish februari wine industri present irrig one adapt measur call develop water network storag facil ground south franc solut increasingli seen primari respons global warm necessari condit sustain vineyard
The United States approves sales of the first-ever lab-grown chicken,    Doubts remain however as to whether artificial meat is actually an environmentally friendly alternative given the energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions involved in producing it. ,"The United States has granted its first-ever approvals to two companies to sell chicken grown directly from animal cells, becoming only the second country to allow lab-grown meat to be offered to consumers.The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved food safety systems at facilities of Upside Foods and Good Meat, a spokesperson for the agency told AFP on Wednesday, June 21, with the companies adding the products would be available soon at select restaurants.Both Upside Foods and Good Meat were cleared on safety grounds by the Food and Drug Administration in November, and the USDA last week reviewed and approved their product labels to ensure they were not misleading.""This approval will fundamentally change how meat makes it to our table,"" said Uma Valeti, CEO and founder of Upside Foods, in a statement. ""It's a giant step forward towards a more sustainable future – one that preserves choice and life.""Josh Tetrick, CEO of Good Meat, the cell-cultured food division of Eat Just, added its ""cultivated meat"" was now ""approved to sell to consumers in the world's largest economy.""Producing the meat in large, high-quality volumes is expensive. But, following approval, Upside processed its first order, placed by three-Michelin-star Chef Dominique Crenn's restaurant Bar Crenn in San Francisco.Good Meat, meanwhile, started production of its first batch that will be sold to celebrity chef and philanthropist Jose Andres. Andres will sell the product at a yet-to-be-revealed restaurant in the capital Washington.Several start-ups are aiming to produce the so-called lab-grown meat, which would allow humans to consume animal protein without the associated environmental harms of farming or animal suffering.The products differ from plant-based substitutes such as soy burgers that mimic the texture and flavor of meat but do not contain any animal protein. Eat Just was the first to receive authorization to make artificial meat, in Singapore in 2020.While succeeding in the general lab-meat market has proven complicated, some companies have set their sights on pet food, whose consumers are less picky. Bond Pet Foods, a Colorado start-up, is creating animal protein from a microbial fermentation process to feed dogs.Lab-grown meat involves first harvesting cells from a living animal or a fertilized egg, to establish a cell bank that can be kept for decades in deep freeze. They are then cultivated in steel tanks where they are fed nutrients similar to what animals would eat. After several weeks, the resulting product is ""harvested"" from the tank and molded into shapes, such as chicken filets or satay.While lab-grown meat has been billed as an environmentally friendly alternative, researchers from the University of California, Davis pushed back against this assumption in a study out last month, which hasn't yet been peer-reviewed. They found cultivated meat's environmental impact is likely to be ""orders of magnitude"" higher – at least in the case of beef, based on production methods. This is because of the energy required and greenhouse gasses emitted across all stages of production.One of the most significant factors is the use of ""purified growth media"" or the ingredients used to help animal cells multiply, in methods similar to those used by biotechnology firms to make pharmaceuticals. ""If companies are having to purify growth media to pharmaceutical levels, it uses more resources, which then increases global warming potential,"" said lead author Derrick Risner.A widely reported 2022 survey of 2,000 US adults by the nonprofit Farm Forward found two-thirds said they would eat cultivated-meat products.",Food,united states granted first ever approvals two companies sell chicken

Ceviche could disappear from Peruvian plates,"    Overfishing and oil spills are threatening the country's marine life – and endangering the national dish, for which fish is the main ingredient. ","How much longer will ceviche be served up in Peru? The dish of raw fish marinated in lime has become a national emblem. But the country's rich sealife is increasingly under threat from human activity. ""There is growing pressure on the ocean. Some species are showing clear signs of overexploitation and could disappear,"" said Juan Carlos Sueiro, a fishing expert with the NGO Oceana, the driving force behind the campaign for ocean preservation and sustainable fishing in the country.Along its 2,600-kilometer coastline, Peru boasts some of the world's best fishing. It benefits from a unique, phytoplankton-rich ecosystem, generated by the cold Humboldt Current, the most productive in the world. Peruvian waters are home to more than 1,000 species of fish, just as many molluscs, and nearly 600 crustaceans.Despite this abundance, scientists have been sounding the alarm for years over the overexploitation of resources. Fishermen too have expressed their concern. At the end of May, Lorenzo Vasquez, secretary-general of the fishermen's union in Chimbote in the north of Peru, told the newspaper La Republica,: ""The industry does not respect minimum catch sizes and juvenile species are caught at all times of the year.""Overfishing and illegal fishing are in the firing line. Industrialists are regularly accused of entering the forbidden 5-mile zone (about 9.5 kilometers off the coast) – a limit that is intended to protect coastal waters from deep-sea nets. ""Those 5 miles represent an extremely important zone for the reproduction and growth of the majority of species,"" said Sueiro. ""However, the poorly selective nets [used by industrial fishermen] do not distinguish between species or their size and indiscriminately catch larvae, young, adults, fish and molluscs."" The lack of checks and the absence of quotas often allow fishermen to operate with impunity.A legislative breakthrough may well bring positive change to the sector. Passed unanimously on April 12, by a Congress deemed largely inefficient and divided in the extreme, the new law redefines traditional artisanal fishing, regulates the size of boats and reinforces protection and controls within the 5-mile area.These are welcome measures to provide a framework for what is a key economic sector in Peru, providing a livelihood for 250,000 people and generating more than $3.2 billion (€2.9 billion) a year. Fish is exported, but also destined for the local market. Peruvians consume an average of 25 kilos per person per year, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Their diet includes bonito, sea bream, sole, giant squid and seafood (mainly scallops and prawns), 80% of which come from small-scale fishing.",Food,much longer ceviche served peru dish raw fish marinated lime become national emblem countrys rich sealife increasingly threat human activity growing pressure ocean species showing clear signs overexploitation could disappear said juan carlos sueiro fishing expert ngo oceana driving force behind campaign ocean preservation sustainable fishing country along kilometer coastline peru boasts worlds best fishing benefits unique phytoplankton rich ecosystem generated cold humboldt current productive world peruvian waters home species fish many molluscs nearly crustaceans despite abundance scientists sounding alarm years overexploitation resources fishermen expressed concern end may lorenzo vasquez secretary general fishermens union chimbote north peru told newspaper republica industry respect minimum catch sizes juvenile species caught times year overfishing illegal fishing firing line industrialists regularly accused entering forbidden mile zone kilometers coast limit intended protect coastal waters deep sea nets miles represent extremely important zone reproduction growth majority species said sueiro however poorly selective nets used industrial fishermen distinguish species size indiscriminately catch larvae young adults fish molluscs lack checks absence quotas often allow fishermen operate impunity legislative breakthrough may well bring positive change sector passed unanimously april congress deemed largely inefficient divided extreme new law redefines traditional artisanal fishing regulates size boats reinforces protection controls within mile area welcome measures provide framework key economic sector peru providing livelihood people generating billion billion year fish exported also destined local market peruvians consume average kilos per person per year according united nations food agriculture organization fao diet includes bonito sea bream sole giant squid seafood mainly scallops prawns come small scale fishing,much longer cevich serv peru dish raw fish marin lime becom nation emblem countri rich sealif increasingli threat human activ grow pressur ocean speci show clear sign overexploit could disappear said juan carlo sueiro fish expert ngo oceana drive forc behind campaign ocean preserv sustain fish countri along kilomet coastlin peru boast world best fish benefit uniqu phytoplankton rich ecosystem gener cold humboldt current product world peruvian water home speci fish mani mollusc nearli crustacean despit abund scientist sound alarm year overexploit resourc fishermen express concern end may lorenzo vasquez secretari gener fishermen union chimbot north peru told newspap republica industri respect minimum catch size juvenil speci caught time year overfish illeg fish fire line industrialist regularli accus enter forbidden mile zone kilomet coast limit intend protect coastal water deep sea net mile repres extrem import zone reproduct growth major speci said sueiro howev poorli select net use industri fishermen distinguish speci size indiscrimin catch larva young adult fish mollusc lack check absenc quota often allow fishermen oper impun legisl breakthrough may well bring posit chang sector pass unanim april congress deem larg ineffici divid extrem new law redefin tradit artisan fish regul size boat reinforc protect control within mile area welcom measur provid framework key econom sector peru provid livelihood peopl gener billion billion year fish export also destin local market peruvian consum averag kilo per person per year accord unit nation food agricultur organ fao diet includ bonito sea bream sole giant squid seafood mainli scallop prawn come small scale fish
Where to have lunch in Paris for less than €20? Our (new) selection of 15 spots,Selection,"Finding a very nice lunch spot for less than €20 in Paris is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge. In order to digest the inflation of costs (in wages, raw materials and energy), restaurant owners are naturally inflating their prices. According to the union Groupement des Hôtelleries et Restaurations de France, restaurant prices increased by 8% in the second half of 2022. Of the 100 gourmet and accessible places that we compiled last year, many have had to revise their menus and their ambitions.Here is a new selection of stylish spots at reasonable prices. Our criteria have remained the same: a set menu for €20 or less (prices observed at the time of our visit), seasonal products that are not imported from the other side of the planet and a warm welcome. In short, places to eat good, beautiful food, and to feel good.The selected locations are mostly located in the east of Paris, where the prices are more attractive. They all have their tricks to keep their costs low. Sometimes, they use leftovers and offal (the chic bistro Orgueil); other times, restaurateurs get away with playing on the quantity of dishes served (the tiny Korean stall Dong Né), replacing meat with vegetables (the canteen Aujourd'hui demain and its vegetarian burgers) or a ""noble"" fish with an underrated equivalent (Le Jourdain). Other establishments, such as OTTO, a Japanese dining cellar created by Michelin-starred chef Eric Trochon, rely on a very attractive lunchtime set menu to make their establishment known.Everywhere, these restaurants are going out of their way to entertain their customers without robbing them. And the energy they put into their work makes you want to encourage them. Bon appetite!This is a gem that we didn't expect in this narrow street parallel to Rue Rambuteau, just behind the Centre Pompidou. There are no tourists here, but there have been more and more regulars every day since this tiny restaurant (about 15 seats) opened in March 2022. The owner Mathieu Ciarlet, 50, left the IT sector to start this business with delight and generosity. The establishment is called ""C'est comme à la maison"" (""it's like what you cook at home"")and the name doesn't lie (as long as you cook very well!).Everything is made on the premises, ""except for the cream,"" said the owner who buries the tables under huge portions of marinated herring, stuffed cabbage, rabbit with mustard and seasonal fruit clafoutis. The weekly menu features a vegetarian dish every Wednesday and a fish dish every Friday. And there's even a nice Breton specialty like kig ha farz, a kind of Armorican stew. Prices are inversely proportional to the size and quality of the plates: starter/main course or main course/dessert costs €19 at lunchtime.",Food,finding nice lunch spot less paris becoming increasingly difficult challenge order digest inflation costs wages raw materials energy restaurant owners naturally inflating prices according union groupement des telleries restaurations france restaurant prices increased second half gourmet accessible places compiled last year many revise menus ambitions new selection stylish spots reasonable prices criteria remained set menu less prices observed time visit seasonal products imported side planet warm welcome short places eat good beautiful food feel good selected locations mostly located east paris prices attractive tricks keep costs low sometimes use leftovers offal chic bistro orgueil times restaurateurs get away playing quantity dishes served tiny korean stall dong replacing meat vegetables canteen aujourdhui demain vegetarian burgers noble fish underrated equivalent jourdain establishments otto japanese dining cellar created michelin starred chef eric trochon rely attractive lunchtime set menu make establishment known everywhere restaurants going way entertain customers without robbing energy put work makes want encourage bon appetite gem didnt expect narrow street parallel rue rambuteau behind centre pompidou tourists regulars every day since tiny restaurant seats opened march owner mathieu ciarlet left sector start business delight generosity establishment called cest comme maison like cook home name doesnt lie long cook well everything made premises except cream said owner buries tables huge portions marinated herring stuffed cabbage rabbit mustard seasonal fruit clafoutis weekly menu features vegetarian dish every wednesday fish dish every friday theres even nice breton specialty like kig farz kind armorican stew prices inversely proportional size quality plates starter main course main course dessert costs lunchtime,find nice lunch spot less pari becom increasingli difficult challeng order digest inflat cost wage raw materi energi restaur owner natur inflat price accord union groupement de telleri restaur franc restaur price increas second half gourmet access place compil last year mani revis menu ambit new select stylish spot reason price criteria remain set menu less price observ time visit season product import side planet warm welcom short place eat good beauti food feel good select locat mostli locat east pari price attract trick keep cost low sometim use leftov offal chic bistro orgueil time restaurateur get away play quantiti dish serv tini korean stall dong replac meat veget canteen aujourdhui demain vegetarian burger nobl fish underr equival jourdain establish otto japanes dine cellar creat michelin star chef eric trochon reli attract lunchtim set menu make establish known everywher restaur go way entertain custom without rob energi put work make want encourag bon appetit gem didnt expect narrow street parallel rue rambuteau behind centr pompid tourist regular everi day sinc tini restaur seat open march owner mathieu ciarlet left sector start busi delight generos establish call cest comm maison like cook home name doesnt lie long cook well everyth made premis except cream said owner buri tabl huge portion marin her stuf cabbag rabbit mustard season fruit clafouti weekli menu featur vegetarian dish everi wednesday fish dish everi friday there even nice breton specialti like kig farz kind armorican stew price invers proport size qualiti plate starter main cours main cours dessert cost lunchtim
"Meat: French totem, political battle","    Long the preserve of the upper classes, meat is now an ideological icon. The 'greening' of personal practices is coming up against an almost identity-based resistance to this food with its many symbolic features. ","It's not so long ago that Roland Barthes wrote, in his 1957 Mythologies: ""Like wine, steak is, in France, a basic element, nationalized even more than socialized; it figures in all the settings of food life."" And yet, while meat – and red meat in particular – may remain ""in all the settings,"" it is no longer a matter of course. Long seen as a guarantor of good health, it now comes under scrutiny when consumed in excess – and is criticized in the name of the fight against climate change.To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the French will definitely have to eat less meat, a reduction ranging from 20% to 70% depending on different scenarios. Even the Cour des Comptes – responsible for overseeing French public finances – advised in May that the number of cows in France should be reduced to meet national climate commitments.While the government is taking up the issue, few politicians dare criticize France's meat consumption, which is twice the global average. They are too afraid of being accused of ""pissing off the French,"" as President Georges Pompidou put it, when it comes to such a symbolically charged food. Certainly, some on the left have taken up the issue. There are the abolitionists, like Aymeric Caron, Ecological Revolution for the Living MP for Paris. Likewise, the Green MP for Paris, Sandrine Rousseau, has also put forward her own arguments.But the rest of France's political leaders are either treading carefully or, on the contrary, jumping to meat's defense. In May, Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire visited a factory producing plant-based sausages and other highly processed substitute products. Nevertheless, it didn't stop him from pledging his love for real meat: ""I love eating a good steak and I don't like extremists who say we should stop eating meat altogether."" After leading his 2022 presidential campaign around meat, with a visit to a butchery school and defending the place of ""good meat"" in French cuisine, communist Fabien Roussel placed other symbols of popular authenticity this summer: He filmed himself sitting at a table in his Corsican campsite, preparing a herring salad.Like the car, meat is now at the heart of a cultural conflict that is all the more sensitive because it affects lifestyles. ""Regarding meat, I am leading a cultural battle,"" said Rousseau. ""It's the easiest and most effective individual gesture you can make to reduce your carbon footprint. Whether you live in a rural or urban area, in a single-parent family or not, everyone can do it."" Despite health and scientific arguments, there is continued resistance. ""We can't pretend that the fight against global warming is consensual, as some people claim, but at least I'm managing to bring this resistance to light,"" she continued.",Food,long ago roland barthes wrote mythologies like wine steak france basic element nationalized even socialized figures settings food life yet meat red meat particular may remain settings longer matter course long seen guarantor good health comes scrutiny consumed excess criticized name fight climate change achieve carbon neutrality french definitely eat less meat reduction ranging depending different scenarios even cour des comptes responsible overseeing french public finances advised may number cows france reduced meet national climate commitments government taking issue politicians dare criticize frances meat consumption twice global average afraid accused pissing french president georges pompidou put comes symbolically charged food certainly left taken issue abolitionists like aymeric caron ecological revolution living paris likewise green paris sandrine rousseau also put forward arguments rest frances political leaders either treading carefully contrary jumping meats defense may economy minister bruno maire visited factory producing plant based sausages highly processed substitute products nevertheless didnt stop pledging love real meat love eating good steak dont like extremists say stop eating meat altogether leading presidential campaign around meat visit butchery school defending place good meat french cuisine communist fabien roussel placed symbols popular authenticity summer filmed sitting table corsican campsite preparing herring salad like car meat heart cultural conflict sensitive affects lifestyles regarding meat leading cultural battle said rousseau easiest effective individual gesture make reduce carbon footprint whether live rural urban area single parent family everyone despite health scientific arguments continued resistance cant pretend fight global warming consensual people claim least managing bring resistance light continued,long ago roland barth wrote mytholog like wine steak franc basic element nation even social figur set food life yet meat red meat particular may remain set longer matter cours long seen guarantor good health come scrutini consum excess critic name fight climat chang achiev carbon neutral french definit eat less meat reduct rang depend differ scenario even cour de compt respons overse french public financ advis may number cow franc reduc meet nation climat commit govern take issu politician dare critic franc meat consumpt twice global averag afraid accus piss french presid georg pompid put come symbol charg food certainli left taken issu abolitionist like aymer caron ecolog revolut live pari likewis green pari sandrin rousseau also put forward argument rest franc polit leader either tread care contrari jump meat defens may economi minist bruno mair visit factori produc plant base sausag highli process substitut product nevertheless didnt stop pledg love real meat love eat good steak dont like extremist say stop eat meat altogeth lead presidenti campaign around meat visit butcheri school defend place good meat french cuisin communist fabien roussel place symbol popular authent summer film sit tabl corsican campsit prepar her salad like car meat heart cultur conflict sensit affect lifestyl regard meat lead cultur battl said rousseau easiest effect individu gestur make reduc carbon footprint whether live rural urban area singl parent famili everyon despit health scientif argument continu resist cant pretend fight global warm consensu peopl claim least manag bring resist light continu
Say cheesecake! Our selection of 15 shops in France to put a sweet smile on your face,Selection,"Cheesecake has been popular in England since the Middle Ages, before being imported to the United States by immigrants at the of the 19th century. The cake then developed with the creation of cream cheese in 1872, and then with the invention of pasteurized cheese by James L. Kraft in 1912. Within a few years, it was the traditional Jewish recipe developed in New York that proved to be the most popular. Some Eastern European countries including Poland have also developed their own recipe for cake made with cream cheese.The cheesecake is most often made with a base using crumbled hard cookies, with a topping made from cream cheese, cottage cheese or ricotta cheese, along with sugar and eggs. Baked (or not), this cake is sometimes served covered with fruit or a red berry coulis. In France, although there are many different kinds of cheesecake, from the Corsican fiadone to the white cheesecake from Alsace, the American-style cheesecake has long been the preserve of specialist bakeries and tea rooms. It became a real craze in Paris and in some French cities in the early 2010s.Having tasted roughly 40 cakes and taken into account various criteria (visual appeal, texture of the biscuit base, flavor of the cheese cream and not forgetting the sacrosanct quality-quantity-price ratio), here is our list of the best in France – in no particular order – for 2023.After learning his trade in various high-quality establishments (such as the Mandarin Oriental, Arnaud Larher and Pascal Lac), Julien Lambert settled with his wife in Epinal, his birthplace, in 2018. With specialties ranging from chocolates (including bars, candies and sweet treats), to cakes (individual portions and desserts to share), pastries and cookies, he also has a delightful and relaxed tea room where you can sit down.Our opinion: The first flavor we get is the acidity of the citrus jelly, followed by the creaminess of the cheese mousse. Then, the comforting, tangy softness of the lemon cake takes over, before ending with the textured sweetness of the thin layer of sweet pastry.Composition: Sweet pastry, lemon cake, lemon syrup, lemon cream, cheesecake mousse, citrus jelly.Price: €4.

Carrying on the legacy of the 'Pope of Beaujolais' at the Domaine Marcel Lapierre,Feature,"The scene takes place on the day of the Beaujolais Nouveau celebration, in the early 2010s, in a chic establishment in Biarritz, southwestern France. A young oenologist is preparing wines for tasting when she is taken to task by a stranger: ""Are you still working with Lapierre? Be careful. Since Marcel died, it's his son who's taken over, and he's making a mess!"" The young woman listens, gritting her teeth. Then, as she was about to greet the intruder, she slipped him her business card: ""Here, I'll leave you my contact details. That way, you'll know how to reach the sister of Lapierre's son, the one whose work is shit!""While Camille Lapierre recounts the anecdote with a smile, the look on her face is unmistakable: time has passed, but she hasn't forgiven that moment of stupidity. Marcel Lapierre died of cancer on October 11, 2010, and it's an understatement to say that many of his competitors in the Beaujolais region were eagerly anticipating the people who would carry on his work. Lapierre had become a benchmark in France and around the world, the king of Morgon and natural wine alike, after years of being regarded as a madman. Shortly before his death, the French Wine Review even referred to him as the ""Pope of Beaujolais."" And everyone knows that being the son of a pope is not a comfortable position to be in.Twelve years have passed. That's a long time in human terms, but for a vineyard, it's no time at all. We're sitting in the shade of a tree, in Villié-Morgon, some 50 kilometers north of Lyon. The pretty courtyard separates the houses from the winery, at the heart of the estate. Opposite us is Mathieu Lapierre, 41. While watching the fire – he was a cook in a previous life and hasn't lost his touch – he listens to his sister Camille, 36, who joined him in 2013.This story in Biarritz makes Mathieu laugh more than it annoys him. ""It's human, and it's true that I had no interest in failing for the first vintage, in 2011. In fact, I was lucky because it was a superb year. But in reality, I'd been working with Marcel for quite some time. We'd made the last few vintages together, so I wasn't a newcomer at all.""The idea of taking over from his father was not an easy one. At least, Mathieu wasn't prepared for it. ""It fell into my lap in 2004,"" he says. ""I was living in Canada when my father came to me and said, 'you know, my mole... well, it's not a mole.' He had melanoma. He knew he was doomed, so he added that if I wanted to take over, I had to get back to France fast."" Of course, the children had always been involved with the life of the estate, punctuated by the immutable chronology and joyous tumult of the grape harvest. They knew all the joys and constraints, the anguish of the little mistakes that can ruin everything, and the joy of producing wine that you believe in. But they had left to make their lives elsewhere – Mathieu in the kitchen, Camille as an oenologist.",Food,scene takes place day beaujolais nouveau celebration early chic establishment biarritz southwestern france young oenologist preparing wines tasting taken task stranger still working lapierre careful since marcel died son whos taken hes making mess young woman listens gritting teeth greet intruder slipped business card ill leave contact details way youll know reach sister lapierres son one whose work shit camille lapierre recounts anecdote smile look face unmistakable time passed hasnt forgiven moment stupidity marcel lapierre died cancer october understatement say many competitors beaujolais region eagerly anticipating people would carry work lapierre become benchmark france around world king morgon natural wine alike years regarded madman shortly death french wine review even referred pope beaujolais everyone knows son pope comfortable position twelve years passed thats long time human terms vineyard time sitting shade tree villi morgon kilometers north lyon pretty courtyard separates houses winery heart estate opposite mathieu lapierre watching fire cook previous life hasnt lost touch listens sister camille joined story biarritz makes mathieu laugh annoys human true interest failing first vintage fact lucky superb year reality working marcel quite time wed made last vintages together wasnt newcomer idea taking father easy one least mathieu wasnt prepared fell lap says living canada father came said know mole well mole melanoma knew doomed added wanted take get back france fast course children always involved life estate punctuated immutable chronology joyous tumult grape harvest knew joys constraints anguish little mistakes ruin everything joy producing wine believe left make lives elsewhere mathieu kitchen camille oenologist,scene take place day beaujolai nouveau celebr earli chic establish biarritz southwestern franc young oenologist prepar wine tast taken task stranger still work lapierr care sinc marcel die son who taken he make mess young woman listen grit teeth greet intrud slip busi card ill leav contact detail way youll know reach sister lapierr son one whose work shit camil lapierr recount anecdot smile look face unmistak time pass hasnt forgiven moment stupid marcel lapierr die cancer octob understat say mani competitor beaujolai region eagerli anticip peopl would carri work lapierr becom benchmark franc around world king morgon natur wine alik year regard madman shortli death french wine review even refer pope beaujolai everyon know son pope comfort posit twelv year pass that long time human term vineyard time sit shade tree villi morgon kilomet north lyon pretti courtyard separ hous wineri heart estat opposit mathieu lapierr watch fire cook previou life hasnt lost touch listen sister camil join stori biarritz make mathieu laugh annoy human true interest fail first vintag fact lucki superb year realiti work marcel quit time wed made last vintag togeth wasnt newcom idea take father easi one least mathieu wasnt prepar fell lap say live canada father came said know mole well mole melanoma knew doom ad want take get back franc fast cours children alway involv life estat punctuat immut chronolog joyou tumult grape harvest knew joy constraint anguish littl mistak ruin everyth joy produc wine believ left make live elsewher mathieu kitchen camil oenologist
"In Argentina, the boom of 'specialty coffee shops'","    In the land of maté, the coffee served in coffee shops has long been of poor quality, but things are changing with the emergence of numerous highly profitable businesses that offer entrepreneurs an anti-crisis formula. ","Rita, Posta, Franja... Almost everywhere in Buenos Aires' trendy neighborhoods, short-named and similarly-styled shops have been flourishing: small, tidy, with short menus featuring the essential flat whites, lattes and espressos. Over the past three years or so, Argentina has seen a boom in these 'specialty coffee shops' – establishments offering a higher-quality beverage, from the beans to the way they are roasted and the maintenance of the machines.The trend started where all gastronomic fashions begin, in Palermo, Buenos Aires' fashionable and touristy district, before taking over the rest of the city. But it has also spread to the rest of the country. ""There's been a change in taste. Coffee culture has always existed here: Argentines love to meet outside for a snack or to have breakfast with a croissant [""medialuna,"" in its Argentine version] and a coffee. But now they do it with a good drink,"" remarked the barista Ramsès Balzan as he sipped a filtered Honduran infusion with notes of chocolate and red fruit on one of the capital's terraces. For a long time, the idea of drinking espresso in Argentina was enough to make black coffee lovers wince – the local bars offered buttery-flavored mugs and sometimes burnt beverages served too hot.In an article published in 2019, BBC Mundo tried to explain ""why coffee is so bad in Buenos Aires, the city of the most beautiful cafés."" Even in the sumptuous ""historic cafes,"" declared cultural heritage because of their architecture or history, ""the coffee itself has never been important. What is important is physically being in the space,"" Carlos Cantini, the author of the Café Contado blog, explained to the British media at the time. Especially since, according to the specialist, among the millions of Italian and Spanish immigrants who landed in Argentina between the late 19th and early 20th century, the Spaniards were the ones who imposed their poor-quality coffee culture. Moreover, in the land of maté (the region's traditional infusion), the press agency Télam reported that annual per capita consumption amounts to just 1 kg (against 5 kg in the European Union).""We prepare coffee with a high level of concentration. For an espresso, it's 30 milliliters of water and 18 grams of coffee weighed on the scales. We serve it at 70 degrees Celsius so that it retains all its flavor,"" boasted Eugenia Cuttat, the manager of the first Cuervo, a pioneer of specialty coffee shop in Buenos Aires he opened in 2017 before launching three similarly-named establishments in the following years.",Food,rita posta franja almost everywhere buenos aires trendy neighborhoods short named similarly styled shops flourishing small tidy short menus featuring essential flat whites lattes espressos past three years argentina seen boom specialty coffee shops establishments offering higher quality beverage beans way roasted maintenance machines trend started gastronomic fashions begin palermo buenos aires fashionable touristy district taking rest city also spread rest country theres change taste coffee culture always existed argentines love meet outside snack breakfast croissant medialuna argentine version coffee good drink remarked barista rams balzan sipped filtered honduran infusion notes chocolate red fruit one capitals terraces long time idea drinking espresso argentina enough make black coffee lovers wince local bars offered buttery flavored mugs sometimes burnt beverages served hot article published bbc mundo tried explain coffee bad buenos aires city beautiful caf even sumptuous historic cafes declared cultural heritage architecture history coffee never important important physically space carlos cantini author caf contado blog explained british media time especially since according specialist among millions italian spanish immigrants landed argentina late early century spaniards ones imposed poor quality coffee culture moreover land mat regions traditional infusion press agency lam reported annual per capita consumption amounts european union prepare coffee high level concentration espresso milliliters water grams coffee weighed scales serve degrees celsius retains flavor boasted eugenia cuttat manager first cuervo pioneer specialty coffee shop buenos aires opened launching three similarly named establishments following years,rita posta franja almost everywher bueno air trendi neighborhood short name similarli style shop flourish small tidi short menu featur essenti flat white latt espresso past three year argentina seen boom specialti coffe shop establish offer higher qualiti beverag bean way roast mainten machin trend start gastronom fashion begin palermo bueno air fashion touristi district take rest citi also spread rest countri there chang tast coffe cultur alway exist argentin love meet outsid snack breakfast croissant medialuna argentin version coffe good drink remark barista ram balzan sip filter honduran infus note chocol red fruit one capit terrac long time idea drink espresso argentina enough make black coffe lover winc local bar offer butteri flavor mug sometim burnt beverag serv hot articl publish bbc mundo tri explain coffe bad bueno air citi beauti caf even sumptuou histor cafe declar cultur heritag architectur histori coffe never import import physic space carlo cantini author caf contado blog explain british media time especi sinc accord specialist among million italian spanish immigr land argentina late earli centuri spaniard one impos poor qualiti coffe cultur moreov land mat region tradit infus press agenc lam report annual per capita consumpt amount european union prepar coffe high level concentr espresso millilit water gram coffe weigh scale serv degre celsiu retain flavor boast eugenia cuttat manag first cuervo pioneer specialti coffe shop bueno air open launch three similarli name establish follow year
Pilot study identifies widespread presence of pesticides in French agricultural soils,"    Over 100 molecules were detected at 47 sites across France. At least one agent was found on 46 of the 47 sites examined, including on land that had never been sprayed. ","Regarding pesticides, Brussels's legislative and regulatory work has never been so out of step with current scientific developments. While the draft European regulation on the ""sustainable use"" of agricultural toxins is being held up in Strasbourg's European Parliament, French researchers published the first nationwide pilot study on the presence of these products in French agricultural soils in the May 25 issue of the journal Environmental Science & Technology.Based on a sample of 47 sites, their findings point to the almost widespread presence of around 60 active substances in arable land and on land that has never been treated. For the researchers, the presence of such products in soils is not surprising. Still, their persistence, number and the concentrations measured are ""unexpected and concerning,"" with levels frequently posing a risk to soil organisms.The scientists monitored 111 pesticide residues at 47 sites across France, selected from the 2,200 Soil Quality Measurement Network locations, launched some 20 years ago and led by the country's National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE). At least one substance was found on 46 of the 47 sites included in the study, which is 98%. On average, 15 distinct molecules were detected in each sample, with a maximum of 33 distinct products on a single site. All the arable soils tested contained at least seven different substances.""It was ANSES [France's French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety, a French government agency] that asked us, in 2018, to look into the possibility of using our soil monitoring network for phytopharmacovigilance purposes,"" said Claire Froger, a researcher with INRAE and primary author of the study. ""The budget allocated to this work enabled us to select around 50 sites, mainly field crop plots and, to a lesser extent, vineyards and orchards, but also 'control' sites, grasslands and forests that had not been treated.""Although spread across the country and representing a wide range of characteristics, the sample is too small to be generalized to mainland France, Froger said.Unsurprisingly, the most frequently found pesticide residues were herbicides and, first and foremost, glyphosate and its main degradation product, AMPA, found in 70% and 83% of the sites studied respectively. Fungicides from the controversial SDHI family (known as ""succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors"") were also present in over 40% of samples. As the authors point out, most of the products found are only used in conventional agriculture, with the exception of certain pyrethrum-derived insecticides which are also authorized for use in organic farming.",Food,regarding pesticides brusselss legislative regulatory work never step current scientific developments draft european regulation sustainable use agricultural toxins held strasbourgs european parliament french researchers published first nationwide pilot study presence products french agricultural soils may issue journal environmental science technology based sample sites findings point almost widespread presence around active substances arable land land never treated researchers presence products soils surprising still persistence number concentrations measured unexpected concerning levels frequently posing risk soil organisms scientists monitored pesticide residues sites across france selected soil quality measurement network locations launched years ago led countrys national research institute agriculture food environment inrae least one substance found sites included study average distinct molecules detected sample maximum distinct products single site arable soils tested contained least seven different substances anses frances french agency food environmental occupational health safety french government agency asked look possibility using soil monitoring network phytopharmacovigilance purposes said claire froger researcher inrae primary author study budget allocated work enabled select around sites mainly field crop plots lesser extent vineyards orchards also control sites grasslands forests treated although spread across country representing wide range characteristics sample small generalized mainland france froger said unsurprisingly frequently found pesticide residues herbicides first foremost glyphosate main degradation product ampa found sites studied respectively fungicides controversial sdhi family known succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors also present samples authors point products found used conventional agriculture exception certain pyrethrum derived insecticides also authorized use organic farming,regard pesticid brusselss legisl regulatori work never step current scientif develop draft european regul sustain use agricultur toxin held strasbourg european parliament french research publish first nationwid pilot studi presenc product french agricultur soil may issu journal environment scienc technolog base sampl site find point almost widespread presenc around activ substanc arabl land land never treat research presenc product soil surpris still persist number concentr measur unexpect concern level frequent pose risk soil organ scientist monitor pesticid residu site across franc select soil qualiti measur network locat launch year ago led countri nation research institut agricultur food environ inra least one substanc found site includ studi averag distinct molecul detect sampl maximum distinct product singl site arabl soil test contain least seven differ substanc ans franc french agenc food environment occup health safeti french govern agenc ask look possibl use soil monitor network phytopharmacovigil purpos said clair froger research inra primari author studi budget alloc work enabl select around site mainli field crop plot lesser extent vineyard orchard also control site grassland forest treat although spread across countri repres wide rang characterist sampl small gener mainland franc froger said unsurprisingli frequent found pesticid residu herbicid first foremost glyphos main degrad product ampa found site studi respect fungicid controversi sdhi famili known succin dehydrogenas inhibitor also present sampl author point product found use convent agricultur except certain pyrethrum deriv insecticid also author use organ farm
BNP Paribas: 'Leader of the energy transition' or bank of a 'burning world'?,"    France’s leading bank claims to be 'green,' but is regularly targeted by environmental NGOs, which denounce certain practices that are far from its commitments. ","For months now, BNP Paribas has been the target of environmental activists who believe that its policies ""condemn the climate,"" as proclaimed on a banner displayed in October 2022 on the steps of the Palais Brongniart, for Climate Finance Day.A milestone was reached when the French bank was sued for its financing of fossil fuels on February 23. At the helm are the non-governmental organizations Our Business, Oxfam and Friends of the Earth, which hope to bring about a ""historic"" trial. For many, the ""bank for a changing world,"" as its motto claims, has become the symbol of a ""burning world."" But is this right or wrong?While BNP Paribas estimates its direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1.65 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year and per employee, its carbon footprint goes much further. Banks are key players in the economy and finance many companies that pollute the environment.To limit this impact, financiers can direct their funds toward low-carbon activities. BNP Paribas believes it is ahead of the game in this area. Its CEO, Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, claims BNP's status as a ""leader of the energy transition."" According to him, the bank has already ""largely"" committed to ""moving away from fossil fuels.""The bank told Le Monde that it finances more low-carbon energy production than fossil fuels. At the end of September 2022, its outstanding loans linked to renewables, biofuel and nuclear were €28.2 billion, compared to €23.7 billion for oil, coal and gas. This is better than its main American and Asian rivals, it assured, referring in particular to a recent comparison by Bloomberg, which places it largely ahead of all major global banks. BNP Paribas is also proud to have supported projects such as the Swedish ""gigafactory"" for electric batteries in Northvolt, which opened at the end of 2022.However, another reality emerges from Banking on Climate Chaos, a reference report published each year by seven NGOs. In 2022, BNP remained the European institution that supported fossil fuels the most, with $20.1 billion (€18.43 billion) in financing, up 22% year-on-year, according to its latest report, released on Thursday, April 13. Since the 2016 Paris Agreement, the French bank has provided fossil fuel majors with more than $166 billion (€151 billion), even ranking as the world’s largest financier of Shell or BP.This discrepancy is due in particular to several indirect financing operations that BNP Paribas does not include in its environmental balance sheet, starting with the issuing of bonds. This service, which consists of helping a company issue securities to investors in return for a commission, is substantial and is not accompanied by any particular environmental constraints. The NGO Reclaim Finance noted that in February, BNP Paribas participated in the issuance of a $4.5 billion (more than €4.1 billion) bond package for Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, alongside France’s Crédit Agricole, Société Générale and Natixis. Unlike its loans, BNP does not quantify how much of its bonds finance fossil fuels.",Investigations,months bnp paribas target environmental activists believe policies condemn climate proclaimed banner displayed october steps palais brongniart climate finance day milestone reached french bank sued financing fossil fuels february helm non governmental organizations business oxfam friends earth hope bring historic trial many bank changing world motto claims become symbol burning world right wrong bnp paribas estimates direct greenhouse gas ghg emissions tonnes equivalent per year per employee carbon footprint goes much banks key players economy finance many companies pollute environment limit impact financiers direct funds toward low carbon activities bnp paribas believes ahead game area ceo jean laurent bonnaf claims bnps status leader energy transition according bank already largely committed moving away fossil fuels bank told monde finances low carbon energy production fossil fuels end september outstanding loans linked renewables biofuel nuclear billion compared billion oil coal gas better main american asian rivals assured referring particular recent comparison bloomberg places largely ahead major global banks bnp paribas also proud supported projects swedish gigafactory electric batteries northvolt opened end however another reality emerges banking climate chaos reference report published year seven ngos bnp remained european institution supported fossil fuels billion billion financing year year according latest report released thursday april since paris agreement french bank provided fossil fuel majors billion billion even ranking world largest financier shell discrepancy due particular several indirect financing operations bnp paribas include environmental balance sheet starting issuing bonds service consists helping company issue securities investors return commission substantial accompanied particular environmental constraints ngo reclaim finance noted february bnp paribas participated issuance billion billion bond package saudi aramco world largest oil company alongside france dit agricole soci rale natixis unlike loans bnp quantify much bonds finance fossil fuels,month bnp pariba target environment activist believ polici condemn climat proclaim banner display octob step palai brongniart climat financ day mileston reach french bank su financ fossil fuel februari helm non government organ busi oxfam friend earth hope bring histor trial mani bank chang world motto claim becom symbol burn world right wrong bnp pariba estim direct greenhous ga ghg emiss tonn equival per year per employe carbon footprint goe much bank key player economi financ mani compani pollut environ limit impact financi direct fund toward low carbon activ bnp pariba believ ahead game area ceo jean laurent bonnaf claim bnp statu leader energi transit accord bank alreadi larg commit move away fossil fuel bank told mond financ low carbon energi product fossil fuel end septemb outstand loan link renew biofuel nuclear billion compar billion oil coal ga better main american asian rival assur refer particular recent comparison bloomberg place larg ahead major global bank bnp pariba also proud support project swedish gigafactori electr batteri northvolt open end howev anoth realiti emerg bank climat chao refer report publish year seven ngo bnp remain european institut support fossil fuel billion billion financ year year accord latest report releas thursday april sinc pari agreement french bank provid fossil fuel major billion billion even rank world largest financi shell discrep due particular sever indirect financ oper bnp pariba includ environment balanc sheet start issu bond servic consist help compani issu secur investor return commiss substanti accompani particular environment constraint ngo reclaim financ note februari bnp pariba particip issuanc billion billion bond packag saudi aramco world largest oil compani alongsid franc dit agricol soci rale natixi unlik loan bnp quantifi much bond financ fossil fuel
The downfall of Paris' mysterious luxury real estate owner,Investigation,"Monday, March 6, was supposed to be a great day for Adrien Labi. The British businessman was in Paris to finalize a major real estate deal with Kering. The French luxury giant headed by François-Henri Pinault had agreed to pay the astronomical sum of one billion euros to buy two buildings located on Avenue Montaigne in Paris' 8th arrondissement, where property prices are among the highest in the capital. A lucrative deal for Labi, who more than doubled his initial wager when he bought the buildings eight years ago.Yet euphoria soon gave way to stupor after the sale was signed. Upon leaving the notary's office, he was arrested by agents of the Brigade Nationale de Répression de la Délinquance Fiscale (National Fiscal Offenses Repression Brigade, BNRDF) and placed in police custody. This improbable development marked the end of 20 years of real estate adventures during which Labi's name could be heard as often in the affluent Parisian districts as in the courts.The spotlight first fell on the man nicknamed the ""Ghost"" of Paris' prestigious neighborhood in the 8th arrondissement, known as the ""Golden Triangle,"" in 2015. An investigation by Le Monde's magazine M brought to light the vast prestigious real estate portfolio in this posh area of Paris' hyper-center, worth hundreds of millions of euros, held by this businessman unknown to the public at large. Yet Labi was already a very familiar figure to the French tax authorities, who started taking an interest in his dealings in the mid-2000s. Riddled with tax audits, his companies were forced to pay millions of euros in tax adjustments, but the ""ghost"" refused and exploited every possible legal recourse to avoid doing so.Slowly, however, the noose tightened as tax authorities referred the most serious cases to the courts. The first judicial investigation was dismissed in 2010. Two years later, the Paris Criminal Court sentenced a company that was part of Labi's empire for tax fraud for the first time. Tempolux was found guilty of having moved four Parisian properties between several companies in Luxembourg and France ""exclusively for tax purposes"" to dodge four million euros in capital gains taxes. Labi, who was not officially linked to any of these companies, managed to slip away. His daughter Clarissa, on the other hand, was sentenced to two years in prison as manager of Tempolux. The court noted that it ""appears highly probable"" that she ""was not the sole perpetrator.""",Investigations,monday march supposed great day adrien labi british businessman paris finalize major real estate deal kering french luxury giant headed fran ois henri pinault agreed pay astronomical sum one billion euros buy two buildings located avenue montaigne paris arrondissement property prices among highest capital lucrative deal labi doubled initial wager bought buildings eight years ago yet euphoria soon gave way stupor sale signed upon leaving notarys office arrested agents brigade nationale pression linquance fiscale national fiscal offenses repression brigade bnrdf placed police custody improbable development marked end years real estate adventures labis name could heard often affluent parisian districts courts spotlight first fell man nicknamed ghost paris prestigious neighborhood arrondissement known golden triangle investigation mondes magazine brought light vast prestigious real estate portfolio posh area paris hyper center worth hundreds millions euros held businessman unknown public large yet labi already familiar figure french tax authorities started taking interest dealings mid riddled tax audits companies forced pay millions euros tax adjustments ghost refused exploited every possible legal recourse avoid slowly however noose tightened tax authorities referred serious cases courts first judicial investigation dismissed two years later paris criminal court sentenced company part labis empire tax fraud first time tempolux found guilty moved four parisian properties several companies luxembourg france exclusively tax purposes dodge four million euros capital gains taxes labi officially linked companies managed slip away daughter clarissa hand sentenced two years prison manager tempolux court noted appears highly probable sole perpetrator,monday march suppos great day adrien labi british businessman pari final major real estat deal kere french luxuri giant head fran oi henri pinault agre pay astronom sum one billion euro buy two build locat avenu montaign pari arrondiss properti price among highest capit lucr deal labi doubl initi wager bought build eight year ago yet euphoria soon gave way stupor sale sign upon leav notari offic arrest agent brigad national pression linquanc fiscal nation fiscal offens repress brigad bnrdf place polic custodi improb develop mark end year real estat adventur labi name could heard often affluent parisian district court spotlight first fell man nicknam ghost pari prestigi neighborhood arrondiss known golden triangl investig mond magazin brought light vast prestigi real estat portfolio posh area pari hyper center worth hundr million euro held businessman unknown public larg yet labi alreadi familiar figur french tax author start take interest deal mid riddl tax audit compani forc pay million euro tax adjust ghost refus exploit everi possibl legal recours avoid slowli howev noos tighten tax author refer seriou case court first judici investig dismiss two year later pari crimin court sentenc compani part labi empir tax fraud first time tempolux found guilti move four parisian properti sever compani luxembourg franc exclus tax purpos dodg four million euro capit gain tax labi offici link compani manag slip away daughter clarissa hand sentenc two year prison manag tempolux court note appear highli probabl sole perpetr
Colombia: The murder of journalist Rafael Moreno and the corruption he exposed,    The investigative consortium Forbidden Stories has continued the work of a reporter who was killed in 2022 while investigating suspected clientelism in public contracts. ,"""If you want to kill me, kill me. But I'll tell you straight up: you won't silence me."" In a 37-minute video that was broadcast live on Facebook on July 21, 2022, journalist Rafael Moreno vigorously condemned the embezzlement of public money he was investigating in the province of Cordoba, in northern Colombia. With supporting evidence, he cited contracts that he believed were artificially inflated, mentioned work that was never completed, named companies and showed his determination. ""They are stealing from the municipality,"" he said, adding that someone has to highlight the wrongdoing. He wore a cap and a white polo shirt bearing the name of his media outlet, Voces de Cordoba (""The Voice of Cordoba"").This province, where he lived, is a strategic corridor of the drug trafficking route. The 2016 peace agreements with the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) have not put an end to civil unrest or corruption scandals, which the journalist made his specialty, almost to the point of obsession. On the Facebook page for his media company, which he launched in 2018, Moreno didn't spare anyone. His 56,000 subscribers didn't miss a single detail of the scandals he exposed almost daily, which concerned local politicians as well as mining companies and paramilitary groups. His tone, which was particularly scathing, had earned him a local notoriety that left him vulnerable.In his video dated July 21, the 37-year-old journalist talked about the last threat he received, found on July 2 in the trunk of his motorcycle: Facing the camera, he held a bullet from a revolver, accompanied by an anonymous note. ""You now know that we know every move you make (...) We know everything about you. We are not going to forgive you for what you do. So you know, my friend, that the rest of the magazine of this 9mm is ready for you?""Less than three months after the video was broadcast, on October 16, 2022, at shortly after 7 pm, Moreno was closing the cash register of Rafo Parilla, the fast-food restaurant that he ran in addition to his work as a journalist. A man entered the restaurant, his head covered with a cap. The man drew a revolver and shot the journalist three times. Moreno died on the spot. Today, his murderer is still at large.Just a few days before his death, he was in contact with the organization Forbidden Stories to keep his information safe. For six months, 30 investigative journalists took over his work, as he wished. By systematically analyzing all the public contracts of the municipalities that interested the journalist, by interviewing numerous sources and by investigating in the field, the consortium was able to uncover a system of clientelism in the province of Cordoba and has revealed a probable misappropriation of public money that could involve several million euros in five municipalities of the region.",Investigations,want kill kill ill tell straight wont silence minute video broadcast live facebook july journalist rafael moreno vigorously condemned embezzlement public money investigating province cordoba northern colombia supporting evidence cited contracts believed artificially inflated mentioned work never completed named companies showed determination stealing municipality said adding someone highlight wrongdoing wore cap white polo shirt bearing name media outlet voces cordoba voice cordoba province lived strategic corridor drug trafficking route peace agreements farc revolutionary armed forces colombia put end civil unrest corruption scandals journalist made specialty almost point obsession facebook page media company launched moreno didnt spare anyone subscribers didnt miss single detail scandals exposed almost daily concerned local politicians well mining companies paramilitary groups tone particularly scathing earned local notoriety left vulnerable video dated july year old journalist talked last threat received found july trunk motorcycle facing camera held bullet revolver accompanied anonymous note know know every move make know everything going forgive know friend rest magazine ready less three months video broadcast october shortly moreno closing cash register rafo parilla fast food restaurant ran addition work journalist man entered restaurant head covered cap man drew revolver shot journalist three times moreno died spot today murderer still large days death contact organization forbidden stories keep information safe six months investigative journalists took work wished systematically analyzing public contracts municipalities interested journalist interviewing numerous sources investigating field consortium able uncover system clientelism province cordoba revealed probable misappropriation public money could involve several million euros five municipalities region,want kill kill ill tell straight wont silenc minut video broadcast live facebook juli journalist rafael moreno vigor condemn embezzl public money investig provinc cordoba northern colombia support evid cite contract believ artifici inflat mention work never complet name compani show determin steal municip said ad someon highlight wrongdo wore cap white polo shirt bear name media outlet voce cordoba voic cordoba provinc live strateg corridor drug traffick rout peac agreement farc revolutionari arm forc colombia put end civil unrest corrupt scandal journalist made specialti almost point obsess facebook page media compani launch moreno didnt spare anyon subscrib didnt miss singl detail scandal expos almost daili concern local politician well mine compani paramilitari group tone particularli scath earn local notorieti left vulner video date juli year old journalist talk last threat receiv found juli trunk motorcycl face camera held bullet revolv accompani anonym note know know everi move make know everyth go forgiv know friend rest magazin readi less three month video broadcast octob shortli moreno close cash regist rafo parilla fast food restaur ran addit work journalist man enter restaur head cover cap man drew revolv shot journalist three time moreno die spot today murder still larg day death contact organ forbidden stori keep inform safe six month investig journalist took work wish systemat analyz public contract municip interest journalist interview numer sourc investig field consortium abl uncov system clientel provinc cordoba reveal probabl misappropri public money could involv sever million euro five municip region
"A Russian spy in Paris: Bulat Yanborisov, rally organizer and high-flying Kremlin agent",Investigation,"Face to face with Vladimir Alexeyev, the deputy head of Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, a smiling Bulat Yanborisov, 53, received the medal of the Order of Alexander Nevsky, a distinction named after a 13th-century Russian hero known for his military victories. On April 22, 2022, the medal, which recognizes long-standing dedication to the Russian armed forces, joined another on Yanborisov's suit jacket: Order of Valor, a decoration obtained for acts of bravery. ""State awards are not given very often,"" said the senior GRU officer. ""Particularly by decree of the president of the Russian Federation... for the contribution to the defense capabilities of the nation and for the success of several special operations.""In all, four men and one woman received this honor for the ""important mission"" carried out on the orders of Vladimir Putin. True to Russian military tradition, Yanborisov then placed his medal in a glass of vodka before drinking. At the end of this short ceremony, filmed with a cell phone and the video of which was obtained by the German magazine Der Spiegel, the Russian website The Insider, and Le Monde, the general said: ""Awards always find their heroes. Well, maybe not always, but thank God these awards have found you.""This Russian hero happens to live incognito in Paris, near Parc Monceau in the 17th arrondissement, with his wife and two children. He travels back and forth between France and the rest of the world with complete impunity, using an unexpected cover: He is the director of the Silk Way Rally, a car race organized between Russia and China that follows the route of the ancient Silk Road and whose offices are partly located in Paris.The Russian businessman moved to the French capital in 2014, in part to manage the rally, which attracts just under 200 drivers including the largest European teams, such as Peugeot and Volkswagen. In May of the same year, Yanborisov obtained a residence permit from the Paris Prefecture which allows him to move freely. At the beginning of 2022 alone, the spy, who holds a Cypriot passport in addition to his Russian one, traveled to Russia at least 12 times.In Paris, he regularly organizes dinners near his apartment in western Paris with the French executives of the Silk Way Rally organization team.

How mafias are infiltrating European ports,    A Europol report is concerned about the infiltration of European ports by ever more organized criminal groups and the ineffectiveness of the counter-measures adopted by public authorities. ,"Two figures suffice to understand organized crime's interest in the main European ports: In 2021, 98 million containers passed through them and only 2% of them were inspected. This proportion may be as high as 10% when it comes to cargo from South America, the almost exclusive production area for booming cocaine trafficking (more than 162 tonnes were seized in the ports of Antwerp, Belgium and Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, alone between 2010 and 2022). The reality of the European continent's ""sieve borders"" has been bluntly exposed in a scalpel-like report by Europol, which was made public in early April and devoted to ""criminal networks in European ports"": ""The likelihood of containers with illicit goods being detected remains low, especially given the high levels of traffic and daily container throughput.""For organized crime, shipping remains a prime vehicle for the movement of human beings and prohibited goods – drugs, contraband cigarettes, counterfeit items and even protected animals. No company seems to be able to escape their industry, whether through fraud or corruption. To mention only the most recent catch, 2.4 tonnes were unearthed in the port of Antwerp on January 18 on board the Lorena, a container ship belonging to the seagoing giant MSC. Six months earlier, in July 2022, 714 kilos of cocaine were discovered on board the Voltaire, owned by CMA CGM, during an inspection carried out by the Spanish police in Algeciras.With an annual transit of more than one million tonnes, Europe's major ports have an unrivaled competitive advantage over all other arrival points: large cargo volumes, automation of cargo handling and connectivity to land transport – in Rotterdam, the port infrastructure extends 40 kilometers inland – and a ""large number of companies and personnel on the scene,"" according to the report, all of which are targets for bribery.The prerequisite of corruption, astronomical sums of money, offered to dockers, crane operators, employees of port authorities and logistics companies, allows for all variations of modus operandi. Although the most obvious is the ""rip-on/rip-off,"" which consists of physically extracting the cargo from a container unloaded from a ship and loading it into a truck, criminal networks know how to innovate. The report notes that the ""cloning"" method has been ""increasingly observed over recent years"": A container scheduled to pass through a scanning portal or undergo another customs control before leaving the port area is simply ""replaced by a replica container (clone) with the same registration number.""",Investigations,two figures suffice understand organized crimes interest main european ports million containers passed inspected proportion may high comes cargo south america almost exclusive production area booming cocaine trafficking tonnes seized ports antwerp belgium rotterdam netherlands alone reality european continents sieve borders bluntly exposed scalpel like report europol made public early april devoted criminal networks european ports likelihood containers illicit goods detected remains low especially given high levels traffic daily container throughput organized crime shipping remains prime vehicle movement human beings prohibited goods drugs contraband cigarettes counterfeit items even protected animals company seems able escape industry whether fraud corruption mention recent catch tonnes unearthed port antwerp january board lorena container ship belonging seagoing giant msc six months earlier july kilos cocaine discovered board voltaire owned cma cgm inspection carried spanish police algeciras annual transit one million tonnes europes major ports unrivaled competitive advantage arrival points large cargo volumes automation cargo handling connectivity land transport rotterdam port infrastructure extends kilometers inland large number companies personnel scene according report targets bribery prerequisite corruption astronomical sums money offered dockers crane operators employees port authorities logistics companies allows variations modus operandi although obvious rip rip consists physically extracting cargo container unloaded ship loading truck criminal networks know innovate report notes cloning method increasingly observed recent years container scheduled pass scanning portal undergo another customs control leaving port area simply replaced replica container clone registration number,two figur suffic understand organ crime interest main european port million contain pass inspect proport may high come cargo south america almost exclus product area boom cocain traffick tonn seiz port antwerp belgium rotterdam netherland alon realiti european contin siev border bluntli expos scalpel like report europol made public earli april devot crimin network european port likelihood contain illicit good detect remain low especi given high level traffic daili contain throughput organ crime ship remain prime vehicl movement human be prohibit good drug contraband cigarett counterfeit item even protect anim compani seem abl escap industri whether fraud corrupt mention recent catch tonn unearth port antwerp januari board lorena contain ship belong seago giant msc six month earlier juli kilo cocain discov board voltair own cma cgm inspect carri spanish polic algecira annual transit one million tonn europ major port unriv competit advantag arriv point larg cargo volum autom cargo handl connect land transport rotterdam port infrastructur extend kilomet inland larg number compani personnel scene accord report target briberi prerequisit corrupt astronom sum money offer docker crane oper employe port author logist compani allow variat modu operandi although obviou rip rip consist physic extract cargo contain unload ship load truck crimin network know innov report note clone method increasingli observ recent year contain schedul pass scan portal undergo anoth custom control leav port area simpli replac replica contain clone registr number
How Russia is staging fake protests in Europe to discredit Ukraine,Investigation,"On February 11, 2023, the Place de la République in Paris was full of people. Thousands of demonstrators had gathered against the pension reform. But, in the middle of the crowd, three men stood out. One of them held a sign, which read: ""EU [European Union], America, stop financing the war in Ukraine.""Less than a month later, on March 5, 2023, the same man stood in Paris' Place Saint-Pierre, in the Montmartre neighborhood in the 18th arrondissement. This time, he performed a Nazi salute in front of banners emblazoned with a Ukrainian flag and which read, ""Erdogan, the earthquake is payback for Russian tourists."" As was the case with their first demonstration, the moment was captured on camera and then published on social media platforms, including Facebook, TikTok and YouTube.Le Monde traced many more similar demonstrations across European capitals. Each time, the message being spread aimed to discredit Ukraine, the EU and Turkey. Le Monde found the same pseudo-demonstrators and the same type of posts across social media. Russian intelligence services are behind the operation.In partnership with the Russian opposition media outlet Dossier Center and the European news organizations DR, Süddeutsche Zeitung, NRK, Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Expressen and SVT, Le Monde obtained and authenticated two documents written by members of the Russian intelligence services.One of them, entitled ""Anti-Erdogan Project"", comments on geopolitical relations between Turkey and Europe. The Russian intelligence services consider that ""Turkey and European Union countries are experiencing significant tensions,"" mentioning the ""tough diplomatic maneuvers"" between Turkey and Sweden and the suspension of the Scandinavian countries' membership process in NATO. The report also states that there is a ""growing anti-Islamic sentiment"" in Europe.To play on this ""feeling,"" the report recommends asking ""local residents or migrants"" to film themselves burning a Turkish flag or tagging slogans ""insulting Erdogan"" in several cities (Paris, The Hague, Brussels, Frankfurt).According to a European intelligence officer specializing in this type of operation, who prefers to remain anonymous, a project of this nature is quite plausible. ""Part of Russia's disinformation campaigns rely on pre-existing tensions, such as those which already exist between Turkey and Germany or between Turkey and France, in this type of hybrid war,"" he explained.Another document reports on the organization and conduct of street action in Paris.

Uber Files: Former Socialist ministers defend their action against Uber's 'total cynicism',    Two former prime ministers were among those invited to speak to the parliamentary investigative committee looking into how the ride-hailing company established itself in the French market. ,"""We did not give in to the pressure, quite the contrary."" Manuel Valls was the interior minister from 2012 to 2014 and then prime minister from 2014 to 2016, at the time when Uber burst onto the scene in France. Questioned by the parliamentary investigative committee about the Uber Files on Thursday, May 11, the former Socialist defended his government's action in the face of an American company ready to establish itself in the country by any means. Also questioned were his former colleagues in the government Bernard Cazeneuve (interior minister from 2014 to 2016, then prime minister from 2016 to 17) and Alain Vidalies (junior minister for transport from 2014 to 2017).Uber was losing billions of dollars, defying laws, and causing chaos. The Uber Files investigation, published in 2022 by Le Monde and its partners in the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), revealed how far the ride-hailing company was willing to go, based on internal documents passed on to the British daily The Guardian by Mark MacGann, Uber's former chief lobbyist in Europe.In France, Uber counted on the support of Emmanuel Macron, who was the economy minister from 2014 to 2016, and considered at the time by the company to be its best ally in the country. But the former ministers believe that this liberal line did not win out. They believe instead that they brought Uber to heel.A key point in the Uber Files revelations was widely discussed by the three ministers: the nature of the relationship between the Finance and Economy Ministry and the company. Le Monde and its partners revealed that Macron and Uber had negotiated a two-stage battle plan, unbeknownst to the rest of the government. Uber would put an end to its illegal private driver service UberPop, and in exchange, Macron would support a simplification of the conditions for drivers to qualify for the profession. The Uber Files revealed the existence of a text message in which Macron assured Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO, that Cazeneuve had ""accepted the deal,"" even though Cazeneuve was at the time leading the charge against the company.The former interior minister categorically denied to members of the Assemblée Nationale that he had accepted, or even had knowledge of any such negotiations with Uber. ""There is no 'deal' to be had with players who, on the grounds that they were financially powerful, felt that they could place themselves above the law,"" he argued. ""I was never aware of a 'deal' in 2015,"" said Valls. ""I would not have accepted it. We must remember that the attacks on public order with physical assaults were numerous and serious. (...) We could not accept totally unfair and illegal competition.""",Investigations,give pressure quite contrary manuel valls interior minister prime minister time uber burst onto scene france questioned parliamentary investigative committee uber files thursday may former socialist defended governments action face american company ready establish country means also questioned former colleagues government bernard cazeneuve interior minister prime minister alain vidalies junior minister transport uber losing billions dollars defying laws causing chaos uber files investigation published monde partners international consortium investigative journalists icij revealed far ride hailing company willing based internal documents passed british daily guardian mark macgann ubers former chief lobbyist europe france uber counted support emmanuel macron economy minister considered time company best ally country former ministers believe liberal line win believe instead brought uber heel key point uber files revelations widely discussed three ministers nature relationship finance economy ministry company monde partners revealed macron uber negotiated two stage battle plan unbeknownst rest government uber would put end illegal private driver service uberpop exchange macron would support simplification conditions drivers qualify profession uber files revealed existence text message macron assured travis kalanick ubers ceo cazeneuve accepted deal even though cazeneuve time leading charge company former interior minister categorically denied members assembl nationale accepted even knowledge negotiations uber deal players grounds financially powerful felt could place law argued never aware deal said valls would accepted must remember attacks public order physical assaults numerous serious could accept totally unfair illegal competition,give pressur quit contrari manuel vall interior minist prime minist time uber burst onto scene franc question parliamentari investig committe uber file thursday may former socialist defend govern action face american compani readi establish countri mean also question former colleagu govern bernard cazeneuv interior minist prime minist alain vidali junior minist transport uber lose billion dollar defi law caus chao uber file investig publish mond partner intern consortium investig journalist icij reveal far ride hail compani will base intern document pass british daili guardian mark macgann uber former chief lobbyist europ franc uber count support emmanuel macron economi minist consid time compani best alli countri former minist believ liber line win believ instead brought uber heel key point uber file revel wide discuss three minist natur relationship financ economi ministri compani mond partner reveal macron uber negoti two stage battl plan unbeknownst rest govern uber would put end illeg privat driver servic uberpop exchang macron would support simplif condit driver qualifi profess uber file reveal exist text messag macron assur travi kalanick uber ceo cazeneuv accept deal even though cazeneuv time lead charg compani former interior minist categor deni member assembl national accept even knowledg negoti uber deal player ground financi power felt could place law argu never awar deal said vall would accept must rememb attack public order physic assault numer seriou could accept total unfair illeg competit
Tax fraud: France seeks to recoup more than €2.5 billion from banks,    Public Accounts Minister Gabriel Attal provided the figure to senators earlier this month. The adjustments primarily cover arrangements that occurred between 2017 and 2019. ,"At the end of March, France's National Financial Prosecutor (PNF) shook the financial world by unleashing a series of unprecedented searches. Five major financial institutions were in the crosshairs, suspected of being involved in the so-called ""CumCum"" scandal – a large-scale circumvention of dividend taxes revealed in 2018 by Le Monde. Nothing filtered out about the financial stakes involved since.But on May 2, before senators, Public Accounts Minister Gabriel Attal cited a figure highlighting the extent of the phenomenon. The amount of tax adjustments to date decided by authorities totals €2.5 billion. This sum, which includes penalties in addition to the reassessed amounts of tax to be paid, specifically targets the institutions searched by the PNF: France's Société Générale, BNP Paribas, Exane (a financial services company owned by BNPP) and Natixis as well as British banking powerhouse HSBC, along with Crédit Agricole, which has admitted to taking part in these tax evasion schemes but was left out of the searches for the time being.These tax adjustments cover arrangements made between 2017 and 2019, bringing the total amount of fraud to nearly €1 billion per year. By comparison, this represents more than 6% of the total amounts recouped by tax authorities each year.""CumCum"" is therefore likely at least as massive as the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (France's financial watchdog, AMF) – the only public body to have attempted to measure the phenomenon – estimated. In 2021, the AMF calculated the loss of tax revenue (excluding penalties) at €400 million-€1 billion per year. But to date, the AMF and the tax authorities have only focused on the simplest aspect of ""CumCum,"" a technique based on securities lending transactions at the time of dividend payment to avoid taxation.However, many other ""CumCum"" strategies share the same objectives. Some exploit loopholes in favorable tax treaties between France and Gulf countries, providing for a complete tax exemption on dividends for their citizens. Others are based on complex financial instruments, such as total return swaps or futures. Such transactions have not yet been subjected to an official valuation but could bring the total loss of tax revenue to between €2-4 billion per year, according to experts consulted in 2018 by Le Monde and the ""CumEx Files"" consortium of journalists.During a hearing at the Sénat in December 2021, Etienne Barel, a deputy director general with the French Banking Federation (FBF), France's banking lobby, said the amounts were ""very largely overestimated."" Barel criticized ""a major methodological flaw."" However, the extent of the first tax adjustments ordered confirms their relevance, especially as they relate once again solely to the simplest securities lending and borrowing operations. Current audits of more recent transactions could inflate the bill.",Investigations,end march frances national financial prosecutor pnf shook financial world unleashing series unprecedented searches five major financial institutions crosshairs suspected involved called cumcum scandal large scale circumvention dividend taxes revealed monde nothing filtered financial stakes involved since may senators public accounts minister gabriel attal cited figure highlighting extent phenomenon amount tax adjustments date decided authorities totals billion sum includes penalties addition reassessed amounts tax paid specifically targets institutions searched pnf frances soci rale bnp paribas exane financial services company owned bnpp natixis well british banking powerhouse hsbc along dit agricole admitted taking part tax evasion schemes left searches time tax adjustments cover arrangements made bringing total amount fraud nearly billion per year comparison represents total amounts recouped tax authorities year cumcum therefore likely least massive autorit des march financiers frances financial watchdog amf public body attempted measure phenomenon estimated amf calculated loss tax revenue excluding penalties million billion per year date amf tax authorities focused simplest aspect cumcum technique based securities lending transactions time dividend payment avoid taxation however many cumcum strategies share objectives exploit loopholes favorable tax treaties france gulf countries providing complete tax exemption dividends citizens others based complex financial instruments total return swaps futures transactions yet subjected official valuation could bring total loss tax revenue billion per year according experts consulted monde cumex files consortium journalists hearing nat december etienne barel deputy director general french banking federation fbf frances banking lobby said amounts largely overestimated barel criticized major methodological flaw however extent first tax adjustments ordered confirms relevance especially relate solely simplest securities lending borrowing operations current audits recent transactions could inflate bill,end march franc nation financi prosecutor pnf shook financi world unleash seri unpreced search five major financi institut crosshair suspect involv call cumcum scandal larg scale circumvent dividend tax reveal mond noth filter financi stake involv sinc may senat public account minist gabriel attal cite figur highlight extent phenomenon amount tax adjust date decid author total billion sum includ penalti addit reassess amount tax paid specif target institut search pnf franc soci rale bnp pariba exan financi servic compani own bnpp natixi well british bank powerhous hsbc along dit agricol admit take part tax evas scheme left search time tax adjust cover arrang made bring total amount fraud nearli billion per year comparison repres total amount recoup tax author year cumcum therefor like least massiv autorit de march financi franc financi watchdog amf public bodi attempt measur phenomenon estim amf calcul loss tax revenu exclud penalti million billion per year date amf tax author focus simplest aspect cumcum techniqu base secur lend transact time dividend payment avoid taxat howev mani cumcum strategi share object exploit loophol favor tax treati franc gulf countri provid complet tax exempt dividend citizen other base complex financi instrument total return swap futur transact yet subject offici valuat could bring total loss tax revenu billion per year accord expert consult mond cumex file consortium journalist hear nat decemb etienn barel deputi director gener french bank feder fbf franc bank lobbi said amount larg overestim barel critic major methodolog flaw howev extent first tax adjust order confirm relev especi relat sole simplest secur lend borrow oper current audit recent transact could inflat bill
Revealed: French authorities' failed maneuvers in lead-up to journalist's kidnapping in Mali,    A joint investigation by news organizations including Le Monde reveals that the French military used journalist Olivier Dubois to try to locate a jihadist leader and failed to prevent his abduction. He was held as a hostage for almost two years. ,"French soldiers from the anti-terrorist Operation Barkhane were informed of a journalist's plan to interview a jihadist leader and tried to use him to locate the chief, a joint investigation by French media reveals. Out of security concerns, this information was withheld while French journalist Olivier Dubois was still a hostage of Al-Qaeda. Once Dubois was freed on March 20 after 711 days in captivity, Le Monde, Libération, Radio France Internationale (RFI) and TV5Monde decided to reveal the fruits of their year-and-a-half-long joint investigation into his abduction. At first, the military tried to use the reporter to locate the Al-Qaeda chief. Then, judging the meeting to be too risky, they gave up on their operation at the last minute. But they did not deploy the appropriate means to prevent the kidnapping of Dubois during the meeting in Gao, in the northeast of Mali, in the spring of 2021.On April 8, 2021, Dubois, a freelancer for Libération, Le Point Afrique and Jeune Afrique who moved to Bamako in 2015, traveled to Gao to interview Abdallah Ag Albakaye, a senior figure in the Al-Qaeda-linked organization Nusrat ul-Islam. The 48-year-old reporter believed he had planned this interview with the greatest discretion. But he had in fact been followed for months by the French army, as confirmed by some 180 pages of French and Malian judicial documents that Le Monde has been able to consult.To prepare his investigation, Dubois worked with a fixer, a young Tuareg whom we will call Kader to protect his anonymity. For several years, Kader facilitated contacts between the journalist and various figures in the north of Mali, in particular some from Nusrat al-Islam, with whom he was close. Dubois knew that Kader has already collaborated in the past with Barkhane but believed he could trust him. At the end of 2020, he asked him to pass on his interview proposal to Ag Albakaye.What the reporter did not know was that his fixer would keep the French military informed until the end of the details of the planned meeting with the jihadist leader. On the day of the kidnapping, in an audio recording that Le Monde was able to listen to, a French lieutenant can be heard distinctly asking Kader about ""the name of the street where they asked [him] to drop off Olivier Dubois.""On the day of the kidnapping, the French military had ""all the information"" about Dubois's appointment: photographs of the journalist's clothes, his passport, his plane ticket, his hotel reservation, the car used to get there, GPS coordinates of the place where Ag Albakaye's men were supposed to find him. The above-mentioned lieutenant confirmed all of this to the agents of the General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI, an intelligence agency), who were questioning him as part of the investigation opened by the national anti-terrorist prosecutor's office, on May 5, 2021, into ""kidnapping as part of an organized gang and in relation to a terrorist enterprise"".",Investigations,french soldiers anti terrorist operation barkhane informed journalists plan interview jihadist leader tried use locate chief joint investigation french media reveals security concerns information withheld french journalist olivier dubois still hostage qaeda dubois freed march days captivity monde lib ration radio france internationale rfi monde decided reveal fruits year half long joint investigation abduction first military tried use reporter locate qaeda chief judging meeting risky gave operation last minute deploy appropriate means prevent kidnapping dubois meeting gao northeast mali spring april dubois freelancer lib ration point afrique jeune afrique moved bamako traveled gao interview abdallah albakaye senior figure qaeda linked organization nusrat islam year old reporter believed planned interview greatest discretion fact followed months french army confirmed pages french malian judicial documents monde able consult prepare investigation dubois worked fixer young tuareg call kader protect anonymity several years kader facilitated contacts journalist various figures north mali particular nusrat islam close dubois knew kader already collaborated past barkhane believed could trust end asked pass interview proposal albakaye reporter know fixer would keep french military informed end details planned meeting jihadist leader day kidnapping audio recording monde able listen french lieutenant heard distinctly asking kader name street asked drop olivier dubois day kidnapping french military information duboiss appointment photographs journalists clothes passport plane ticket hotel reservation car used get gps coordinates place albakayes men supposed find mentioned lieutenant confirmed agents general directorate internal security dgsi intelligence agency questioning part investigation opened national anti terrorist prosecutors office may kidnapping part organized gang relation terrorist enterprise,french soldier anti terrorist oper barkhan inform journalist plan interview jihadist leader tri use locat chief joint investig french media reveal secur concern inform withheld french journalist olivi duboi still hostag qaeda duboi freed march day captiv mond lib ration radio franc international rfi mond decid reveal fruit year half long joint investig abduct first militari tri use report locat qaeda chief judg meet riski gave oper last minut deploy appropri mean prevent kidnap duboi meet gao northeast mali spring april duboi freelanc lib ration point afriqu jeun afriqu move bamako travel gao interview abdallah albakay senior figur qaeda link organ nusrat islam year old report believ plan interview greatest discret fact follow month french armi confirm page french malian judici document mond abl consult prepar investig duboi work fixer young tuareg call kader protect anonym sever year kader facilit contact journalist variou figur north mali particular nusrat islam close duboi knew kader alreadi collabor past barkhan believ could trust end ask pass interview propos albakay report know fixer would keep french militari inform end detail plan meet jihadist leader day kidnap audio record mond abl listen french lieuten heard distinctli ask kader name street ask drop olivi duboi day kidnap french militari inform duboiss appoint photograph journalist cloth passport plane ticket hotel reserv car use get gp coordin place albakay men suppos find mention lieuten confirm agent gener director intern secur dgsi intellig agenc question part investig open nation anti terrorist prosecutor offic may kidnap part organ gang relat terrorist enterpris
Video investigation: How the Sudanese military junta repressed protests with live ammunition,   ,"What happened on June 30, when the opposition to the Sudanese military regime called for a historic demonstration? The junta had promised to let the people ""exercise their right to peaceful assembly. But at 8 am, the government cut off the internet.Le Monde collected and authenticated footage made available when the Internet was reactivated. The footage documents the death of eight protesters during the day, most of them from gunfire. Across the country, many other activists were shot and wounded, or arrested and detained by the hundreds.Footage from the same day shows law enforcement officers equipped with AK-47 automatic assault rifles. The units involved included officers from the Central Reserve Police (CRP). Various observers, including nongovernmental organizations, have accused these agents of ""serious human rights violations"". These accusations prompted the United States to place the CRP on its list of organizations subject to financial sanctions, in March. In late June, the CRP took part in the violent crackdown on the mostly peaceful protesters, alongside Khartoum police, riot police, and the army.To turn on English subtitles, click on 'Menu' on the bottom right of the video.",Videos,happened june opposition sudanese military regime called historic demonstration junta promised let people exercise right peaceful assembly government cut internet monde collected authenticated footage made available internet reactivated footage documents death eight protesters day gunfire across country many activists shot wounded arrested detained hundreds footage day shows law enforcement officers equipped automatic assault rifles units involved included officers central reserve police crp various observers including nongovernmental organizations accused agents serious human rights violations accusations prompted united states place crp list organizations subject financial sanctions march late june crp took part violent crackdown mostly peaceful protesters alongside khartoum police riot police army turn english subtitles click menu bottom right video,happen june opposit sudanes militari regim call histor demonstr junta promis let peopl exercis right peac assembl govern cut internet mond collect authent footag made avail internet reactiv footag document death eight protest day gunfir across countri mani activist shot wound arrest detain hundr footag day show law enforc offic equip automat assault rifl unit involv includ offic central reserv polic crp variou observ includ nongovernment organ accus agent seriou human right violat accus prompt unit state place crp list organ subject financi sanction march late june crp took part violent crackdown mostli peac protest alongsid khartoum polic riot polic armi turn english subtitl click menu bottom right video

Refugees held in cage on EU's border as Frontex agents watched,Investigation,"In a small town in southern Bulgaria, in between a nursery school, the local football stadium and rows of quiet houses, a makeshift cage, housed in a shed, is used by Bulgarian border guards to detain would-be migrants. This is shown in footage revealed by Le Monde, in partnership with Lighthouse Reports, Monitor, Der Spiegel, Domani, RFE/RL Bulgaria and Sky News.The makeshift cage is made up of iron bars and littered with garbage and is visible from the street. On five occasions, between October 15 and November 25, Le Monde's partners were able to film the area, where, every time, a dozen or so men had been detained.In one of the videos, some of the men are questioned by the guards about their country of origin: ""Afghans? Morocco?"" Le Monde interviewed four men – Syrians and Afghans – who told us that they had been locked up following their attempt to enter Bulgaria.This cage is not an official holding zone for the detention of people entering illegally. The country is thus free from any control, including regular inspections by NGOs such as the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee or the Ombudsman of the Republic of Bulgaria. However, the cage is located in a police complex loaned by Sredets (south-east Bulgaria) city hall to the border police, which reports to the Interior Ministry.A car from the European agency Frontex, in charge of controlling the Schengen area's external borders, is visible three times in footage filmed by Le Monde and its partners a few meters from the cage.An internal Frontex document, which Le Monde was able to see, emphasizes that their presence is not a one-off: ten of its agents have been permanently deployed in Sredets since the end of March 2022. It is a collaboration between Frontex and the Bulgarian border guards, confirmed in this local press article.

How Frontex surveillance equipment is used by the Libyan coast guard to intercept migrants,   ,"To turn on English subtitles, click on 'Menu' on the bottom right of the video.A drone, several aircraft and hundreds of hours of flight time. Since 2018, Frontex has been conducting intense surveillance in the central Mediterranean skies. But the images that the European border and coast guard agency is taking are not only used by member states: the Libyan authorities, who are not supposed to have direct access, also use them. The publication of a dozen surveillance images on Libyan coast guard Facebook pages, between 2018 and 2022, proves it.Le Monde has cross-checked these images with data available in open source and information collected by NGOs active in the Mediterranean (all of the data used in this investigation is freely accessible here). This work allowed us to state that seven of these images were taken by Frontex aircraft.Three images dated May 8, 2019, show a Libyan patrol boat transferring nearly seventy people on board. The migrants were trying to reach Europe on a small boat. But the images also show the invisible: If the Libyan coast guard was able to catch up with this boat, it is thanks to Frontex's assistance. The Libyans, who only have a few patrol boats and no surveillance aircraft, have trouble finding such small boats by themselves.Frontex says that it is not collaborating with the Libyan coast guard. But the Libyan rescue coordination center raises questions: according to NGOs specializing in rescue operations at sea, it is only a facade for the Libyan coast guard.",Videos,turn english subtitles click menu bottom right video drone several aircraft hundreds hours flight time since frontex conducting intense surveillance central mediterranean skies images european border coast guard agency taking used member states libyan authorities supposed direct access also use publication dozen surveillance images libyan coast guard facebook pages proves monde cross checked images data available open source information collected ngos active mediterranean data used investigation freely accessible work allowed state seven images taken frontex aircraft three images dated may show libyan patrol boat transferring nearly seventy people board migrants trying reach europe small boat images also show invisible libyan coast guard able catch boat thanks frontexs assistance libyans patrol boats surveillance aircraft trouble finding small boats frontex says collaborating libyan coast guard libyan rescue coordination center raises questions according ngos specializing rescue operations sea facade libyan coast guard,turn english subtitl click menu bottom right video drone sever aircraft hundr hour flight time sinc frontex conduct intens surveil central mediterranean sky imag european border coast guard agenc take use member state libyan author suppos direct access also use public dozen surveil imag libyan coast guard facebook page prove mond cross check imag data avail open sourc inform collect ngo activ mediterranean data use investig freeli access work allow state seven imag taken frontex aircraft three imag date may show libyan patrol boat transfer nearli seventi peopl board migrant tri reach europ small boat imag also show invis libyan coast guard abl catch boat thank frontex assist libyan patrol boat surveil aircraft troubl find small boat frontex say collabor libyan coast guard libyan rescu coordin center rais question accord ngo special rescu oper sea facad libyan coast guard
China's rural inhabitants are not included in official unemployment statistics,"    China's statistics only include those who hold urban residence permits. The more precarious 'rural migrant workers' are not included, as the authorities consider that they can return to work on the farm if they are out of work. ","Officially, China's urban unemployment rate stood at 5% in September, down 0.2 points compared to August. This is a particularly low rate for an economy in poor health: The real estate sector is in crisis, tech platforms are under close government surveillance and exports fell by 6.2% in September, the fifth consecutive month of decline. At the same time, statistics about young people have not been published since the record high reached in June (21.3%). So what are urban unemployment statistics worth?""Do you know how many rural people are unemployed? Zero: By definition, rural inhabitants are never unemployed, because in theory, every rural family in China owns a small plot of farmland,"" said Scott Rozelle, the co-director of the Stanford Center on China's Economy and Institutions. The authorities consider that rural inhabitants can return to the farm if they are out of work.Their situation is the consequence of the ""hukou"" system, a residence permit that ties a person to his or her place of birth for access to social services, health care, pensions and childhood education. China credits this system, inherited from the Maoist period, for the country's lack of shantytowns.So, in the absence of social rights, ""rural migrant workers"" spend most of their careers in precarious jobs in the city but end up returning to their home provinces. Their children usually remain in the village, cared for by their grandparents. In 2022, they made up 295 million out of China's 780 million workers, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.In times of crisis, they are the first to suffer. In June and July of 2023, Rozelle and his team visited over 100 rural Chinese families. ""We asked how much those in the family who worked earned. On average, it was 60% of what they made in 2019 before the Covid crisis,"" said Rozelle, who is also the author of Invisible China: How the Urban-Rural Divide Threatens China's Rise (University of Chicago Press, 2020). ""We're facing a problem of massive unemployment and underemployment among rural inhabitants, which undermines confidence in the future. The problem affects many more people than urban youth unemployment.""",Economy,officially chinas urban unemployment rate stood september points compared august particularly low rate economy poor health real estate sector crisis tech platforms close government surveillance exports fell september fifth consecutive month decline time statistics young people published since record high reached june urban unemployment statistics worth know many rural people unemployed zero definition rural inhabitants never unemployed theory every rural family china owns small plot farmland said scott rozelle director stanford center chinas economy institutions authorities consider rural inhabitants return farm work situation consequence hukou system residence permit ties person place birth access social services health care pensions childhood education china credits system inherited maoist period countrys lack shantytowns absence social rights rural migrant workers spend careers precarious jobs city end returning home provinces children usually remain village cared grandparents made million chinas million workers according national bureau statistics times crisis first suffer june july rozelle team visited rural chinese families asked much family worked earned average made covid crisis said rozelle also author invisible china urban rural divide threatens chinas rise university chicago press facing problem massive unemployment underemployment among rural inhabitants undermines confidence future problem affects many people urban youth unemployment,offici china urban unemploy rate stood septemb point compar august particularli low rate economi poor health real estat sector crisi tech platform close govern surveil export fell septemb fifth consecut month declin time statist young peopl publish sinc record high reach june urban unemploy statist worth know mani rural peopl unemploy zero definit rural inhabit never unemploy theori everi rural famili china own small plot farmland said scott rozel director stanford center china economi institut author consid rural inhabit return farm work situat consequ hukou system resid permit tie person place birth access social servic health care pension childhood educ china credit system inherit maoist period countri lack shantytown absenc social right rural migrant worker spend career precari job citi end return home provinc children usual remain villag care grandpar made million china million worker accord nation bureau statist time crisi first suffer june juli rozel team visit rural chines famili ask much famili work earn averag made covid crisi said rozel also author invis china urban rural divid threaten china rise univers chicago press face problem massiv unemploy underemploy among rural inhabit undermin confid futur problem affect mani peopl urban youth unemploy
Beijing embarrassed by mass youth unemployment,In Depth,"For the past month, Rachel has been looking for work in Shanghai, China. ""I'm expecting to earn 6,000 or 7,000 yuan [€777 or €907], just enough to pay the rent and put food on the table, but I'm hoping to find a company that will allow me to flourish, in advertising or marketing,"" said the young woman. An interesting job: This is what many young people from China's middle class are looking for, even if it means accepting a low salary or learning to be patient. Graduating in the summer of 2022, as one lockdown followed another in China, Rachel (she gave only her English first name), 28, went through a few interviews, before returning to her parents' home to wait for better days. She's almost become a ""full-time child,"" she said with a smile, an expression that has come to designate unemployed graduates who have decided to stay with their parents and be supported, sometimes in exchange for helping out. It's a symptom, among others, of a slowing economy.Youth unemployment has never been higher than in 2023. In June, it reached a record high of 21.3%. With a new cohort of graduates, July's figures were shaping up to be even worse. The authorities have decided to stop releasing details of unemployment by age group. This move has prompted a deluge of online criticism: On the microblogging site Weibo, the subject attracted 140 million views in just a few hours.The reasons for this are well known: The country has not recovered from three years of its drastic zero-Covid policy and has been having a difficult year. Exports are plummeting, real estate is in an unprecedented crisis and domestic consumption has been struggling to recover. As a result, despite a weak basis for comparison, China is barely expected to reach its growth target for 2023, set ""around 5%"" at the beginning of the year.In this crisis context, young people, who lack experience, are generally the first to be affected. Officially, total urban unemployment has remained low, at 5% in September, even if this analysis has been criticized. (It excludes migrant workers, considered as rural.) Young people are all the more affected as they work mainly in the sectors most exposed to the crisis (services, private sector, precarious jobs), and less in the public sector and industry.To make matters worse, between 2021 and 2022, the Chinese authorities launched a regulatory campaign against web platforms such as Alibaba, Tencent and Meituan. Hardest hit, the private tutoring sector was virtually banned in July 2021, resulting in the elimination of hundreds of thousands of teaching jobs. At the same time, a campaign to reduce the indebtedness of property developers has led to the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of jobs, from construction workers to architects, estate agents and mortgage brokers. Already burned by the costly zero-Covid policy, Chinese entrepreneurs have been wondering where the Communist Party's next campaign will strike.",Economy,past month rachel looking work shanghai china expecting earn yuan enough pay rent put food table hoping find company allow flourish advertising marketing said young woman interesting job many young people chinas middle class looking even means accepting low salary learning patient graduating summer one lockdown followed another china rachel gave english first name went interviews returning parents home wait better days shes almost become full time child said smile expression come designate unemployed graduates decided stay parents supported sometimes exchange helping symptom among others slowing economy youth unemployment never higher june reached record high new cohort graduates julys figures shaping even worse authorities decided stop releasing details unemployment age group move prompted deluge online criticism microblogging site weibo subject attracted million views hours reasons well known country recovered three years drastic zero covid policy difficult year exports plummeting real estate unprecedented crisis domestic consumption struggling recover result despite weak basis comparison china barely expected reach growth target set around beginning year crisis context young people lack experience generally first affected officially total urban unemployment remained low september even analysis criticized excludes migrant workers considered rural young people affected work mainly sectors exposed crisis services private sector precarious jobs less public sector industry make matters worse chinese authorities launched regulatory campaign web platforms alibaba tencent meituan hardest hit private tutoring sector virtually banned july resulting elimination hundreds thousands teaching jobs time campaign reduce indebtedness property developers led disappearance hundreds thousands jobs construction workers architects estate agents mortgage brokers already burned costly zero covid policy chinese entrepreneurs wondering communist partys next campaign strike,past month rachel look work shanghai china expect earn yuan enough pay rent put food tabl hope find compani allow flourish advertis market said young woman interest job mani young peopl china middl class look even mean accept low salari learn patient graduat summer one lockdown follow anoth china rachel gave english first name went interview return parent home wait better day she almost becom full time child said smile express come design unemploy graduat decid stay parent support sometim exchang help symptom among other slow economi youth unemploy never higher june reach record high new cohort graduat juli figur shape even wors author decid stop releas detail unemploy age group move prompt delug onlin critic microblog site weibo subject attract million view hour reason well known countri recov three year drastic zero covid polici difficult year export plummet real estat unpreced crisi domest consumpt struggl recov result despit weak basi comparison china bare expect reach growth target set around begin year crisi context young peopl lack experi gener first affect offici total urban unemploy remain low septemb even analysi critic exclud migrant worker consid rural young peopl affect work mainli sector expos crisi servic privat sector precari job less public sector industri make matter wors chines author launch regulatori campaign web platform alibaba tencent meituan hardest hit privat tutor sector virtual ban juli result elimin hundr thousand teach job time campaign reduc indebted properti develop led disappear hundr thousand job construct worker architect estat agent mortgag broker alreadi burn costli zero covid polici chines entrepreneur wonder communist parti next campaign strike
US auto strike: The workers' vote will be decisive in old industrial America,"Will voters follow Donald Trump in his crusade against the unions and the environment, or Joe Biden, who wants to give industry a boost while ensuring a proper ecological transition?","It's a labor victory for the United Auto Workers (UAW), and a political success for Joe Biden, who made the trip to Detroit, Michigan, on September 26 to support strikers who are the beating heart of this industry. The appearance of the US president on a picket line, unprecedented in the country's history, was proof of his conviction that reindustrialization also requires the revival of the unions.Fighting their cause since mid-September, Ford's unionized employees, followed by those of Stellantis, have pulled off a 25% wage increase over five years, guarantees of plant maintenance and better social security coverage. Of the ""Big Three,"" only General Motors is yet to be convinced, stubbornly refusing to reach an agreement with its army of casual workers, but also the UAW rank and file, who will be consulted over the next few days. This will be a test for Shawn Fain, president of this powerful union who has played a major role in this longstanding conflict, using numerous ploys to destabilize the bosses of the major automakers.""This is a historic agreement that will guarantee workers the pay, benefits, dignity and respect they deserve,"" Biden said in a statement. This is nothing short of a fair return for workers who during the 2008-2009 crisis made heavy sacrifices to save the auto industry, and who now work for companies that are making substantial profits, as former president Barack Obama recalled at the start of the conflict.The day after the president's visit to Detroit, Donald Trump spoke not far from there – to non-unionized workers at a plant spared from the conflict. As one might expect, he offered no support to the strikers, but told them they were on the wrong track and criticized the risks of the green transition for the automotive sector: ""It doesn’t make a damn bit of difference what you get because in two years you're all going to be out of business,"" said Biden's likely Republican opponent.The working-class vote will be decisive in old industrial America, symbolized by the key states of Michigan and Ohio. Will voters follow Trump in his crusade against the unions and the environment, or the outgoing president, who is working on giving industry a boost while ensuring the ecological transition? Polls show that ""Bidenomics"" have failed to convince half of them.

Greek economy minister welcomes his country's recovery,"    After years of historic economic depression, Greece's economy has shown signs of recovery. Kostis Hatzidakis, who maintains caution, emphasizes the importance of reducing debt while addressing tax evasion. ","In December 2010, Kostis Hatzidakis was mobbed by demonstrators outside the Greek Parliament. A simple rank-and-file New Democracy (center-right party) MP at the time, albeit a former minister and notably responsible for the privatization of Olympic airline, he was attacked and ended up with a bloodied face. A photo showing him visibly in shock went viral.Almost 13 years later, in his corner office with a magnificent view of the same parliament building, the man who is now Greek minister of the economy is savoring the progress that has been made. After a historic depression, the Greek economy has returned to growth over the past three years. The figure should reach 2.5% in 2023 and 2.0% in 2024, well ahead of the rest of the eurozone (at 0.7% and 1.2% respectively). As a symbol of this improvement, the S&P rating agency removed Greece of its junk bond status on Friday, October 13.""For the last decade, our aim was to stay in the euro[zone]. We came very close to disaster. The objective of the current decade, for Greece, is to converge our economy toward the European average."" Today, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is just 68% that of the European Union (EU), making it the second lowest of the 27 EU member states, ahead only of Bulgaria.There is no question, however, of the government increasing its spending. Year after year, it wants to continue posting a ""primary"" budget surplus (before interest payments on debt), which enables it to reduce its public debt. ""We can't perform miracles,"" stressed Hatzidakis, recalling that after the scale of the crisis that shook Greece, whose economy remains 20% below its 2007 level, reconstruction will necessarily be slow.""[Primary surpluses] are not only a precondition to reducing our debt but also a way of proving that we have learned from the past, changed our mindset and are adopting international best practice."" Greece's debt, which reached 206% of GDP in 2020, today stands at 159% and should fall to 152% by the end of 2024, taking advantage of both inflation and the country's significant growth to mechanically reduce this ratio.Public services, bled dry after years of austerity measures, will have to wait, even if Hatzidakis would like to help out hospitals, which have been hit particularly hard. He promises to recruit 15,000 healthcare staff over the next few years. As for the civil service, the rule is now to stabilize the headcount, with one new recruit for every departure, whereas downsizing has long been the norm.",Economy,december kostis hatzidakis mobbed demonstrators outside greek parliament simple rank file new democracy center right party time albeit former minister notably responsible privatization olym attacked ended bloodied face photo showing visibly shock went viral almost years later corner office magnificent view parliament building man greek minister economy savoring progress made historic depression greek economy returned growth past three years figure reach well ahead rest eurozone respectively symbol improvement rating agency removed greece junk bond status friday october last decade aim stay euro zone came close disaster objective current decade greece converge economy toward european average today gross domestic product gdp per capita european union making second lowest member states ahead bulgaria question however government increasing spending year year wants continue posting primary budget surplus interest payments debt enables reduce public debt cant perform miracles stressed hatzidakis recalling scale crisis shook greece whose economy remains level reconstruction necessarily slow primary surpluses precondition reducing debt also way proving learned past changed mindset adopting international best practice greeces debt reached gdp today stands fall end taking advantage inflation countrys significant growth mechanically reduce ratio public services bled dry years austerity measures wait even hatzidakis would like help hospitals hit particularly hard promises recruit healthcare staff next years civil service rule stabilize headcount one new recruit every departure whereas downsizing long norm,decemb kosti hatzidaki mob demonstr outsid greek parliament simpl rank file new democraci center right parti time albeit former minist notabl respons privat olym attack end bloodi face photo show visibl shock went viral almost year later corner offic magnific view parliament build man greek minist economi savor progress made histor depress greek economi return growth past three year figur reach well ahead rest eurozon respect symbol improv rate agenc remov greec junk bond statu friday octob last decad aim stay euro zone came close disast object current decad greec converg economi toward european averag today gross domest product gdp per capita european union make second lowest member state ahead bulgaria question howev govern increas spend year year want continu post primari budget surplu interest payment debt enabl reduc public debt cant perform miracl stress hatzidaki recal scale crisi shook greec whose economi remain level reconstruct necessarili slow primari surplus precondit reduc debt also way prove learn past chang mindset adopt intern best practic greec debt reach gdp today stand fall end take advantag inflat countri signific growth mechan reduc ratio public servic bled dri year auster measur wait even hatzidaki would like help hospit hit particularli hard promis recruit healthcar staff next year civil servic rule stabil headcount one new recruit everi departur wherea downsiz long norm
Europe trails behind the United States in economic growth,"    The eurozone economy contracted by 0.1% in the third quarter, while the US economy grew by 1.2%. Over the past fifteen years, the gap between Europe and America has widened steadily. ","The eurozone economy contracted in the third quarter. On Tuesday, October 31, Eurostat’s first estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) in the twenty countries of the single currency was -0.1%. This is in stark contrast to the United States, which grew by 1.2% over the same period.""It’s almost becoming a universal law,"" François Geerolf, an economist at the Observatoire français des conjonctures économiques (The French Observatory of Economic Conditions), lamented. ""With each crisis, the eurozone permanently loses a few points of growth to the United States."" For the past fifteen years, Europe has been falling further and further behind, shock after shock: the eurozone crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine... Since 2007, per capita growth on the other side of the Atlantic has been 19.2%, compared with 7.6% in the eurozone. A gap of almost twelve points. Before the pandemic, the gap was already ten points, and it has started to widen again in the last eighteen months.Over 2023 as a whole, growth in the Eurozone is expected to reach 0.7%, compared with 2.1% in the United States, according to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Germany, in particular, is suffering, with a slight recession expected at -0.5%, while France should grow by 1%.For Europeans, cities like New York and San Francisco have become extremely expensive, while American visitors to Europe are astonished by the low prices. ""The average income of Americans is more than 20% higher than that of people living in the eurozone,"" pointed out Philippe Crevel, economist at Lorello Ecodata, a consulting firm. ""The standard of living of executives is much higher than that of their European counterparts. American tourists are particularly sought-after because of their abundant purchasing power. The average retirement, taking into account retirement savings, is much higher in the USA than in many European countries.""The main explanation for this growth differential can be summed up in two words, according to Geerolf: ""Fiscal policy."" During the pandemic, the US government supported households in a historic way by issuing multiple stimulus checks. Households were able to put some of this money aside and remain sitting on exceptional savings, which they haven't quite finished spending. As a result, more than half of current growth comes from consumption. On the European side, support was also generous during the pandemic, but not at the same level: the US budget deficit in 2020 and 2021 was 14% and 11.6% of GDP, double that of the eurozone, at 7.1% and 5.3%, respectively.",Economy,eurozone economy contracted third quarter tuesday october eurostat first estimate gross domestic product gdp twenty countries single currency stark contrast united states grew period almost becoming universal law fran ois geerolf economist observatoire fran ais des conjonctures conomiques french observatory economic conditions lamented crisis eurozone permanently loses points growth united states past fifteen years europe falling behind shock shock eurozone crisis covid pandemic war ukraine since per capita growth side atlantic compared eurozone gap almost twelve points pandemic gap already ten points started widen last eighteen months whole growth eurozone expected reach compared united states according forecasts international monetary fund imf germany particular suffering slight recession expected france grow europeans cities like new york san francisco become extremely expensive american visitors europe astonished low prices average income americans higher people living eurozone pointed philippe crevel economist lorello ecodata consulting firm standard living executives much higher european counterparts american tourists particularly sought abundant purchasing power average retirement taking account retirement savings much higher usa many european countries main explanation growth differential summed two words according geerolf fiscal policy pandemic government supported households historic way issuing multiple stimulus checks households able put money aside remain sitting exceptional savings havent quite finished spending result half current growth comes consumption european side support also generous pandemic level budget deficit gdp double eurozone respectively,eurozon economi contract third quarter tuesday octob eurostat first estim gross domest product gdp twenti countri singl currenc stark contrast unit state grew period almost becom univers law fran oi geerolf economist observatoir fran ai de conjonctur conomiqu french observatori econom condit lament crisi eurozon perman lose point growth unit state past fifteen year europ fall behind shock shock eurozon crisi covid pandem war ukrain sinc per capita growth side atlant compar eurozon gap almost twelv point pandem gap alreadi ten point start widen last eighteen month whole growth eurozon expect reach compar unit state accord forecast intern monetari fund imf germani particular suffer slight recess expect franc grow european citi like new york san francisco becom extrem expens american visitor europ astonish low price averag incom american higher peopl live eurozon point philipp crevel economist lorello ecodata consult firm standard live execut much higher european counterpart american tourist particularli sought abund purchas power averag retir take account retir save much higher usa mani european countri main explan growth differenti sum two word accord geerolf fiscal polici pandem govern support household histor way issu multipl stimulu check household abl put money asid remain sit except save havent quit finish spend result half current growth come consumpt european side support also gener pandem level budget deficit gdp doubl eurozon respect
Liaoning: China's emerging industrial hub,    The northeastern industrial province has undergone a spectacular technological transformation and established a model in which the public authorities and the private sector are steering the development of world-class companies. ,"For a long time in China, the country's northeastern region did not enjoy a good reputation. Too polluted, too dominated by giant state-owned companies, too corrupt and too similar to neighboring Russia. The north was yesterday's China.In 1992, it was in the far south of the country that Deng Xiaoping kicked off his reforms and opened up the country. The region that embodied China's success was Shenzhen, not Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning and the country's main northeastern province alongside Heilongjiang and Jilin.With one problem leading to another, Liaoning long suffered from a second handicap: The province's strongman in the 1990s was Bo Xilai, an ambitious Maoist who became Xi Jinping's main political rival 10 years later. Bo has been in prison since 2012, and the country's ruler is said not to hold Liaoning close to his heart.Yet these days now seem long gone. Liaoning now feels confident and proud enough of its transformation to invite – with Beijing's approval, of course – a few foreign journalists to witness its transformation.Shenyang, like the German Ruhr, is doing far better than its reputation might suggest. In the 20th century, the city was famous for its sea of smokestacks. But by the end of the 1990s, some 300 steelworks closed in a redundancy plan probably unrivaled anywhere in the world. Nowadays, Shenyang is a green city.BMW has built its main Chinese plant there. The company is the city's biggest taxpayer and employs 23,000 workers, not counting its 430 subcontractors, including the French company Michelin, which employs around 3,000 people.While Liaoning's overall population (42 million inhabitants) is declining due to young people's attraction to the higher wages of the south, Shenyang's is increasing. By the end of the decade, Shenyang's population should exceed 10 million. Its rival, Dalian (population 7 million), the major port in the province's south, is enjoying the same attractiveness.As much as leaders in the country's south like to showcase private companies, those in Liaoning do not shy away from highlighting their role and economic pro-activeness. Like Xi, they are convinced that state-owned groups must continue spearheading the economy. The companies they spotlight are almost all closely linked to the political authorities.Founded in 1921 (when the region was occupied by Japan), North Heavy Industry is the archetypal metallurgical conglomerate, manufacturing everything from steel for the automotive industry to giant tunnel-boring machines for public works groups.

"Belgium, a 'social paradise' under threat","    The federal government remains generous, with a model based on redistribution, advantageous unemployment and wages and pensions indexed to inflation. But the public debt and deficit are worsening, undermining the system's sustainability. ","A surprising conversation was overheard in a bar in the Châtelain neighborhood, the haunt of many French people in Brussels. ""These Belgians are incredible, with their unemployment benefits not limited in time and their wages indexed: How do they do it?"" Is Belgium a social paradise? It's not always a paradise for labor organizing, in any case: The country was the European champion for strikes between 2011 and 2020, with 97 days per year per 1,000 workers – compared with 93 in France, 18 in Germany and one in Switzerland – according to a study published in January by the Hans-Böckler Foundation.Nonetheless, the image is maintained by anecdotes: ""I know a guy who has just celebrated 20 years of unemployment in Charleroi,"" said a local resident. And by decisions made by companies: The ING bank will soon be offering a few hundred older employees the chance to stay at home and do nothing, while keeping their salaries, thus avoiding the need to undertake downsizing measures. And by statements from politicians: Prime Minister Alexander De Croo explained, on the occasion of the parliamentary debates on the 2024 budget (an agreement was reached on October 9), that the automatic indexing of salaries to inflation has made it possible to maintain the prosperity of citizens, who already have a median salary (€3,507 gross, according to the official Statbel organization) among the highest in the world and have seen their incomes increase by 20% in four years.These salaries could still rise by almost 8% in 2023. ""It's better than our German and French neighbors; the country is doing well,"" De Croo. The quality of the healthcare system and the offer of early retirement are other features that often wow foreign residents.On the other hand, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) study published in April on labor taxation in 2022 was less rosy. Belgian salaries are taxed at 53% for a single person (47% in France, 47.8% in Germany) and at 45.5% for an employed couple with children (40.7% in France, 29.4% for the OECD average).There's another nuance to the story. The federal government remains generous, but this is costing it dearly. The issue of a one-year state bond in September was a huge success (630,000 subscribers, for €22 billion in the space of a few days), but for the first time, it pushed public debt over the €500 billion mark. That's almost 100% of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2022. Furthermore, the government has just cut some €750 million from the healthcare budget, a sector already in crisis, in an attempt to limit the slippage in the public deficit (3.9% of GDP forecast by the European Commission for 2023).",Economy,surprising conversation overheard bar telain neighborhood haunt many french people brussels belgians incredible unemployment benefits limited time wages indexed belgium social paradise always paradise labor organizing case country european champion strikes days per year per workers compared france germany one switzerland according study published january hans ckler foundation nonetheless image maintained anecdotes know guy celebrated years unemployment charleroi said local resident decisions made companies ing bank soon offering hundred older employees chance stay home nothing keeping salaries thus avoiding need undertake downsizing measures statements politicians prime minister alexander croo explained occasion parliamentary debates budget agreement reached october automatic indexing salaries inflation made possible maintain prosperity citizens already median salary gross according official statbel organization among highest world seen incomes increase four years salaries could still rise almost better german french neighbors country well croo quality healthcare system offer early retirement features often wow foreign residents hand organization economic cooperation development oecd study published april labor taxation less rosy belgian salaries taxed single person france germany employed couple children france oecd average theres another nuance story federal government remains generous costing dearly issue one year state bond september huge success subscribers billion space days first time pushed public debt billion mark thats almost gross domestic product gdp furthermore government cut million healthcare budget sector already crisis attempt limit slippage public deficit gdp forecast european commission,surpris convers overheard bar telain neighborhood haunt mani french peopl brussel belgian incred unemploy benefit limit time wage index belgium social paradis alway paradis labor organ case countri european champion strike day per year per worker compar franc germani one switzerland accord studi publish januari han ckler foundat nonetheless imag maintain anecdot know guy celebr year unemploy charleroi said local resid decis made compani ing bank soon offer hundr older employe chanc stay home noth keep salari thu avoid need undertak downsiz measur statement politician prime minist alexand croo explain occas parliamentari debat budget agreement reach octob automat index salari inflat made possibl maintain prosper citizen alreadi median salari gross accord offici statbel organ among highest world seen incom increas four year salari could still rise almost better german french neighbor countri well croo qualiti healthcar system offer earli retir featur often wow foreign resid hand organ econom cooper develop oecd studi publish april labor taxat less rosi belgian salari tax singl person franc germani employ coupl children franc oecd averag there anoth nuanc stori feder govern remain gener cost dearli issu one year state bond septemb huge success subscrib billion space day first time push public debt billion mark that almost gross domest product gdp furthermor govern cut million healthcar budget sector alreadi crisi attempt limit slippag public deficit gdp forecast european commiss
Kazakhstan's mining resources are increasingly coveted,"    On November 1 and 2, President Emmanuel Macron will visit Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. France hopes to strengthen its supply of critical metals in the region. ","Essential to the energy transition, rare earths like scandium, lanthanum and cerium are the oil of tomorrow. Ever since the West began to realize its excessive dependence on China, it has been stepping up its diversification strategies. ""To secure its resources, the European Union [EU] is increasingly turning to countries such as Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan,"" summarized Thomas Gomart, director of the French Institute of International Relations.On Saturday, October 28, the death of at least 45 miners at an ArcelorMittal site was a tragic reminder of the vast underground wealth of this remote Central Asian country. On November 1 and 2, French President Emmanuel Macron will visit Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The motive is ""to support both countries in their reform efforts,"" stressed the president's office, as well as strengthening ties ""in the economic sphere, particularly in terms of energy and supplies.""Alongside some 15 business leaders, including from EDF, Suez and Orano (formerly Areva), as well as the Geological and Mining Research Bureau, Macron promised ""announcements of contracts."" In particular, Paris is in line to participate in the construction of Kazakhstan's first nuclear power plant. Access to critical metals will also be on the agenda.Since gaining its independence in 1991, the former Soviet Union country has boasted of having ""all the ores and elements on Mendeleev's table"" in its subsoil. According to the United States Geological Survey, it is the world's leading producer of uranium (with 40% of global production), the second largest producer of chromite (13%) and the fifth largest producer of cadmium (5.9%). It is also reported to have abundant rhenium, zinc and manganese mines.However, it is difficult to assess the full extent of its reserves. ""The economy is somewhat opaque,"" summarized Agathe Demarais of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), an independent think-tank. This is because a large part of the infrastructure and mining assets date back to the Soviet era and because the major Kazakh clans close to the government share part of the resources. Western executives working in the sector are quick to confirm, on condition of anonymity, that corruption is not uncommon.Despite this, the country is one of the most attractive in the region for foreigners, not least thanks to its reform efforts. ""Since its independence, it has been able to exploit its hydrocarbon fields using international companies with the technical skills required to do so,"" explained Dominique Menu, former Central Asia head for BNP Paribas, who writes regularly about the region.",Economy,essential energy transition rare earths like scandium lanthanum cerium oil tomorrow ever since west began realize excessive dependence china stepping diversification strategies secure resources european union increasingly turning countries canada australia kazakhstan summarized thomas gomart director french institute international relations saturday october death least miners arcelormittal site tragic reminder vast underground wealth remote central asian country november french president emmanuel macron visit kazakhstan uzbekistan motive support countries reform efforts stressed presidents office well strengthening ties economic sphere particularly terms energy supplies alongside business leaders including edf suez orano formerly areva well geological mining research bureau macron promised announcements contracts particular paris line participate construction kazakhstans first nuclear power plant access critical metals also agenda since gaining independence former soviet union country boasted ores elements mendeleevs table subsoil according united states geological survey worlds leading producer uranium global production second largest producer chromite fifth largest producer cadmium also reported abundant rhenium zinc manganese mines however difficult assess full extent reserves economy somewhat opaque summarized agathe demarais european council foreign relations ecfr independent think tank large part infrastructure mining assets date back soviet era major kazakh clans close government share part resources western executives working sector quick confirm condition anonymity corruption uncommon despite country one attractive region foreigners least thanks reform efforts since independence able exploit hydrocarbon fields using international companies technical skills required explained dominique menu former central asia head bnp paribas writes regularly region,essenti energi transit rare earth like scandium lanthanum cerium oil tomorrow ever sinc west began realiz excess depend china step diversif strategi secur resourc european union increasingli turn countri canada australia kazakhstan summar thoma gomart director french institut intern relat saturday octob death least miner arcelormitt site tragic remind vast underground wealth remot central asian countri novemb french presid emmanuel macron visit kazakhstan uzbekistan motiv support countri reform effort stress presid offic well strengthen tie econom sphere particularli term energi suppli alongsid busi leader includ edf suez orano formerli areva well geolog mine research bureau macron promis announc contract particular pari line particip construct kazakhstan first nuclear power plant access critic metal also agenda sinc gain independ former soviet union countri boast ore element mendeleev tabl subsoil accord unit state geolog survey world lead produc uranium global product second largest produc chromit fifth largest produc cadmium also report abund rhenium zinc manganes mine howev difficult assess full extent reserv economi somewhat opaqu summar agath demarai european council foreign relat ecfr independ think tank larg part infrastructur mine asset date back soviet era major kazakh clan close govern share part resourc western execut work sector quick confirm condit anonym corrupt uncommon despit countri one attract region foreign least thank reform effort sinc independ abl exploit hydrocarbon field use intern compani technic skill requir explain dominiqu menu former central asia head bnp pariba write regularli region
"Macron visits Central Asia to 'strengthen, complement and accelerate' partnerships","    Macron signed a series of contracts with Kazakhstan, which already supplies 40% of France's uranium, and is the first French president to go to Uzbekistan since 1994. ","French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Uzbekistan Wednesday evening after a trip to Kazakhstan, part of a two-day tour to boost France's footprint in Central Asia. The French leader's visit comes as European nations jostle for influence in the resource-rich region, where Russia, China, Turkey and Europe all have economic interests. Visiting Kazakhstan's capital Astana earlier, Macron said he wanted to ""strengthen [...] complement and accelerate"" France's partnership with the country.Central Asia, which has long been under Russian influence and was part of the Soviet Union, is receiving increasing attention from other powers as Moscow is taken up with its war in Ukraine. Macron acknowledged the ""geopolitical pressures"" being put on Kazakhstan, which borders Russia to its north and China to its east.""I do not underestimate the geopolitical difficulties, the pressures, sometimes the jostling to which you may be subjected,"" Macron told Kazakhstan's president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. ""In a world where great powers want to become hegemonies and where regional powers are becoming unpredictable,"" the French president said he welcomed Kazakhstan's ""refusal ... to take the route of becoming a vassal.""Tokayev, in turn, said France was his country's ""key and reliable partner in the EU"" and that he wanted to give their partnership ""extra impetus."" ""Kazakhstan is the world's top uranium producer, contributing over a quarter of nuclear fuel consumed in Europe,"" he said. ""With nuclear power comprising 63 percent of France's energy sector, there is vast potential for further cooperation,"" he added.The leaders signed a series of contracts in sectors ranging from minerals and energy to pharmaceuticals and aerospace.French energy giant EDF is in the running to build Kazakhstan's first nuclear power station – a project due to be decided on in a referendum this year. The Elysee also announced Paris would supply Ground Master 400 air defense radar systems to Kazakhstan to boost the country's ""sovereignty.""France is the fifth-biggest foreign investor in Kazakhstan, ahead of China, mainly because of the involvement of energy giant TotalEnergies in the massive Kashagan offshore oil field project. The head of French uranium company Orano, which already has a mine in Kazakhstan, is in Macron's delegation. Trade turnover between France and Kazakhstan reached €5.3 billion ($5.6 billion) in 2022 and Kazakhstan supplies around 40 percent of France's uranium needs.China is particularly active in Central Asia with its ""Belt and Road"" project, but Europe and Turkey have also shown growing interest. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are due to visit Astana this week after Macron.Both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are aiming for greater economic openness and balanced diplomacy, even though Russia remains their primary partner. Kazakhstan is part of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) – a Moscow-led military alliance – along with two other central Asian states, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The Kremlin said Wednesday that it maintained a ""historic"" partnership with its ally Astana.""Kazakhstan is a sovereign nation that develops relations with other countries at its own discretion,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday when asked if Russia was concerned by Macron's visit.The trip to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan aims to support ""interest in a diversification of partnerships expressed by both countries,"" a French presidency source said. Several French presidents have visited Kazakhstan since the fall of the Soviet Union, but Macron will be the first to go to Uzbekistan since 1994.Despite their declared wish for political liberalization, both countries are authoritarian states where protests are often violently repressed. Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has put an end to two decades of isolation imposed by his predecessor and former mentor Islam Karimov, but there is still no real political opposition.Macron prefers to emphasize the ""reform dynamic"" going on in the country and has said that the rule of law issue will be brought up during his visit.",Economy,french president emmanuel macron arrived uzbekistan

Sweden: Tesla employees strike to defend their wages and social model,    The movement began on October 27 to protest the American brand's refusal to sign a Swedish collective bargaining agreement. ,"""Shame on you Tesla, shame on you!"" Former Swedish Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan Löfven is not one to let his emotions get the better of him. But the former leader of the powerful IF Metall union saw red when he learned that American giant Tesla was refusing to sign Swedish collective bargaining agreements.In a message posted on Facebook on Sunday, October 29, Löfven announced that he would be boycotting Elon Musk's cabs, and encouraged his fellow citizens to suspend their purchase of a Tesla ""until an agreement is signed.""Since October 27, the union has been on strike at seven Tesla dealerships in Sweden, employing 120 people. If no agreement is reached by November 3, IF Metall is threatening to extend the strike to the brand's service centers in some 15 towns. The Transport union, meanwhile, has announced that it is ready to block all Tesla electric vehicle departures and arrivals at four of Sweden's largest ports from November 7, in solidarity with the company's employees.""This dispute is about wages, pensions and insurance for our members working at Tesla. But fundamentally, it's also about defending the whole Swedish labor market model. In Sweden, unions and employers agree on working conditions, within the framework of collective bargaining,"" IF Metall President Marie Nilsson explained.According to the union, talks with the company broke down on October 24. Refusing to sign the industry agreements, Tesla representatives reportedly stated that the group ""has no collective agreement anywhere in the world"" and that ""this is a decision that has to be made at the highest level of the company,"" according to Veli-Pekka Säikkälä, in charge of collective agreement negotiations at IF Metall.The development is exceptional. The last time the metalworking union compensated its striking members was in 2010. Then, IF Metall was in dispute with a stone-cutting company, which refused to sign collective agreements. On several occasions since then, the union has threatened to stop work, but each time a compromise was reached before a strike was called.Another peculiarity: the American company seems ready for confrontation. Tesla employees have revealed that they have been threatened by their bosses. The Swedish newspaper Dagens Arbetare reported that Tesla was planning to break the strike by transferring employees from one dealership to another within the country, in violation of the Saltjöbad agreement, which has regulated relations between unions and employers since 1938.",Economy,shame tesla shame former swedish social democrat prime minister stefan fven one let emotions get better former leader powerful metall union saw red learned american giant tesla refusing sign swedish collective bargaining agreements message posted facebook sunday october fven announced would boycotting elon musks cabs encouraged fellow citizens suspend purchase tesla agreement signed since october union strike seven tesla dealerships sweden employing people agreement reached november metall threatening extend strike brands service centers towns transport union meanwhile announced ready block tesla electric vehicle departures arrivals four swedens largest ports november solidarity companys employees dispute wages pensions insurance members working tesla fundamentally also defending whole swedish labor market model sweden unions employers agree working conditions within framework collective bargaining metall president marie nilsson explained according union talks company broke october refusing sign industry agreements tesla representatives reportedly stated group collective agreement anywhere world decision made highest level company according veli pekka ikk charge collective agreement negotiations metall development exceptional last time metalworking union compensated striking members metall dispute stone cutting company refused sign collective agreements several occasions since union threatened stop work time compromise reached strike called another peculiarity american company seems ready confrontation tesla employees revealed threatened bosses swedish newspaper dagens arbetare reported tesla planning break strike transferring employees one dealership another within country violation saltj bad agreement regulated relations unions employers since,shame tesla shame former swedish social democrat prime minist stefan fven one let emot get better former leader power metal union saw red learn american giant tesla refus sign swedish collect bargain agreement messag post facebook sunday octob fven announc would boycot elon musk cab encourag fellow citizen suspend purchas tesla agreement sign sinc octob union strike seven tesla dealership sweden employ peopl agreement reach novemb metal threaten extend strike brand servic center town transport union meanwhil announc readi block tesla electr vehicl departur arriv four sweden largest port novemb solidar compani employe disput wage pension insur member work tesla fundament also defend whole swedish labor market model sweden union employ agre work condit within framework collect bargain metal presid mari nilsson explain accord union talk compani broke octob refus sign industri agreement tesla repres reportedli state group collect agreement anywher world decis made highest level compani accord veli pekka ikk charg collect agreement negoti metal develop except last time metalwork union compens strike member metal disput stone cut compani refus sign collect agreement sever occas sinc union threaten stop work time compromis reach strike call anoth peculiar american compani seem readi confront tesla employe reveal threaten boss swedish newspap dagen arbetar report tesla plan break strike transfer employe one dealership anoth within countri violat saltj bad agreement regul relat union employ sinc
ArcelorMittal asked to leave Kazakhstan following tragedy in Kostenko coal mine,"    A coal mine owned by the multinational company experienced a methane blast that killed 46 miners on October 28, leading Kazakh President Tokayev to call for the company's departure. ","A red star, a distant symbol of Kazakhstan's Soviet past, still stands at the top of the headframe overseeing the descent and ascent of workers at the Kostenko coalmine run by ArcelorMittal. On Saturday, October 28, however, 46 miners did not come back out of the mine alive, victims of a methane explosion and the ensuing fire. This death toll makes it the deadliest accident in Kazakhstan's history. The country is home to significant natural resources (oil, gas, uranium, coal, iron, gold) that are highly sought after by multinational corporations, including ArcelorMittal for iron and coal, TotalEnergies for hydrocarbons and Orano for uranium.The tragedy led the president of Kazakhstan to declare a national day of mourning on Sunday, October 29, and, more importantly, to announce the departure of the group led by Indian businessman Lakshmi Mittal. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev placed the entire responsibility for the accident on ""the worst enterprise in Kazakhstan's history in terms of cooperation with the government."" The Kazakh government has signed a preliminary agreement to nationalize ArcelorMittal Temirtau, the local subsidiary of the global steel giant. The steel and mining group, which had been present in the country since 1995, stated on Monday that it was committed to completing the operation as quickly as possible to minimize production disruptions related to its departure. At the same time, the company's stock price fell by more than 4% on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.The Kazakh public does not tolerate these mining accidents in a country where oil, gas and minerals remain the backbone of the economy. Five deaths occurred at the Shakhtinskaya mine in August 2022, and five more at the Lenin mine three months later. This is the very location where the worst mining disaster in the country occurred in 2006, resulting in 41 deaths, until the recent accident on October 29. A total of approximately 200 people are believed to have lost their lives at Kazakh mining sites since the country gained independence.The government has accused the Luxembourg-based steel company of not implementing complete safety regulations and of operating outdated facilities. But the group claims to have improved the situation in recent years, within the general regulatory framework set by the 1995 Safety and Health in Mines Convention by the International Labor Organization. This convention stipulates that ""employers shall take all necessary measures to eliminate or minimize the risks to safety and health in mines under their control."" This includes air quality and adequate ventilation, structural maintenance, ground stabilization, prevention of explosions and fires, periodic inspections and more.",Economy,red star distant symbol kazakhstans soviet past still stands top headframe overseeing descent ascent workers kostenko coalmine run arcelormittal saturday october however miners come back mine alive victims methane explosion ensuing fire death toll makes deadliest accident kazakhstans history country home significant natural resources oil gas uranium coal iron gold highly sought multinational corporations including arcelormittal iron coal totalenergies hydrocarbons orano uranium tragedy led president kazakhstan declare national day mourning sunday october importantly announce departure group led indian businessman lakshmi mittal president kassym jomart tokayev placed entire responsibility accident worst enterprise kazakhstans history terms cooperation government kazakh government signed preliminary agreement nationalize arcelormittal temirtau local subsidiary global steel giant steel mining group present country since stated monday committed completing operation quickly possible minimize production disruptions related departure time companys stock price fell amsterdam stock exchange kazakh public tolerate mining accidents country oil gas minerals remain backbone economy five deaths occurred shakhtinskaya mine august five lenin mine three months later location worst mining disaster country occurred resulting deaths recent accident october total approximately people believed lost lives kazakh mining sites since country gained independence government accused luxembourg based steel company implementing complete safety regulations operating outdated facilities group claims improved situation recent years within general regulatory framework set safety health mines convention international labor organization convention stipulates employers shall take necessary measures eliminate minimize risks safety health mines control includes air quality adequate ventilation structural maintenance ground stabilization prevention explosions fires periodic inspections,red star distant symbol kazakhstan soviet past still stand top headfram overse descent ascent worker kostenko coalmin run arcelormitt saturday octob howev miner come back mine aliv victim methan explos ensu fire death toll make deadliest accid kazakhstan histori countri home signific natur resourc oil ga uranium coal iron gold highli sought multin corpor includ arcelormitt iron coal totalenergi hydrocarbon orano uranium tragedi led presid kazakhstan declar nation day mourn sunday octob importantli announc departur group led indian businessman lakshmi mittal presid kassym jomart tokayev place entir respons accid worst enterpris kazakhstan histori term cooper govern kazakh govern sign preliminari agreement nation arcelormitt temirtau local subsidiari global steel giant steel mine group present countri sinc state monday commit complet oper quickli possibl minim product disrupt relat departur time compani stock price fell amsterdam stock exchang kazakh public toler mine accid countri oil ga miner remain backbon economi five death occur shakhtinskaya mine august five lenin mine three month later locat worst mine disast countri occur result death recent accid octob total approxim peopl believ lost live kazakh mine site sinc countri gain independ govern accus luxembourg base steel compani implement complet safeti regul oper outdat facil group claim improv situat recent year within gener regulatori framework set safeti health mine convent intern labor organ convent stipul employ shall take necessari measur elimin minim risk safeti health mine control includ air qualiti adequ ventil structur mainten ground stabil prevent explos fire period inspect
Macron to visit Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to bolster France's influence in the region,    The French president heads to Central Asia on Wednesday in hopes of strengthening economic ties and discussing energy projects in a region contested by global powers. ,"French President Emmanuel Macron heads to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on Wednesday, November 1, aiming to boost France's profile in a region where Russia, China, Turkey and Europe are all jostling for influence.

"Journalist Dom Phillips wanted to save the Amazon, he was killed for investigating illegal fishing",Investigation,"In the photo, Dom Phillips is wearing khaki pants, flip-flops and a hat. He is turned towards the other man in the photo and appears to be listening attentively. The two men are seated on wooden planks on the banks of the Itaquai River in the Amazon's Javari Valley. In the background, half a dozen wooden boats are tied to the shore.The man smiling at Phillips in the photo goes by ""Caboco,"" or sometimes ""Caboclo."" He is known by Indigenous people in the region for illegally fishing on their territory. Phillips spent the months before his death working on a book titled How to Save the Amazon, about threats to the tropical rainforest. His interest in illegal fishing led to this trip. But Philips never had the chance to publish the book. Two days after this photo was taken, on June 5, 2022, the journalist and his guide, Bruno Pereira, were killed on the Itaquai River by illegal fishermen, members of the same group as ""Caboco.""This photo, one of the last taken of Phillips, was almost buried in the heart of the Amazon forever. Almost four months after the two men were murdered, Pereira's colleagues – members of an Indigenous patrol within the Union of Indigenous Peoples of the Javari Valley (Univaja) – discovered one of Pereira's phones under a pile of mud and sticks. On it was this photo.At the time of the discovery, the team was accompanied by journalist and member of the Forbidden Stories consortium, Sônia Bridi, who was making a documentary for TV Globo. ""His colleagues went back [to the crime scene] with a metal detector to find more evidence,"" Bridi told Forbidden Stories. ""They found Dom's glasses, his notebook – [which is] all wet, we can't read anything – his press card."" The team turned everything over to the federal police, Bridi added. This discovery contained crucial elements that helped reconstruct the last moments of the two men's lives and confirmed the sequence of events determined by police investigators.It took months of work to simply power on the phone and extract its data. Being able to access the photos was unexpected. ""The phone spent months in the water before the river levels went down,"" Bridi said. These final photos were entrusted to the 16 media organizations that make up the ""Bruno and Dom Project,"" led by Forbidden Stories, which is continuing the work of Pereira and Phillips on the destruction of the Amazon. Over the past year, this group of more than 50 journalists has investigated land grabbing, ranching's ties to deforestation, mining and illegal fishing – an investigation that ultimately cost these two defenders of the Amazon their lives.",Investigations,photo dom phillips wearing khaki pants flip flops hat turned towards man photo appears listening attentively two men seated wooden planks banks itaquai river amazons javari valley background half dozen wooden boats tied shore man smiling phillips photo goes caboco sometimes caboclo known indigenous people region illegally fishing territory phillips spent months death working book titled save amazon threats tro rainforest interest illegal fishing led trip philips never chance publish book two days photo taken june journalist guide bruno pereira killed itaquai river illegal fishermen members group caboco photo one last taken phillips almost buried heart amazon forever almost four months two men murdered pereiras colleagues members indigenous patrol within union indigenous peoples javari valley univaja discovered one pereiras phones pile mud sticks photo time discovery team accompanied journalist member forbidden stories consortium nia bridi making documentary globo colleagues went back crime scene metal detector find evidence bridi told forbidden stories found doms glasses notebook wet cant read anything press card team turned everything federal police bridi added discovery contained crucial elements helped reconstruct last moments two mens lives confirmed sequence events determined police investigators took months work simply power phone extract data able access photos unexpected phone spent months water river levels went bridi said final photos entrusted media organizations make bruno dom project led forbidden stories continuing work pereira phillips destruction amazon past year group journalists investigated land grabbing ranchings ties deforestation mining illegal fishing investigation ultimately cost two defenders amazon lives,photo dom phillip wear khaki pant flip flop hat turn toward man photo appear listen attent two men seat wooden plank bank itaquai river amazon javari valley background half dozen wooden boat tie shore man smile phillip photo goe caboco sometim caboclo known indigen peopl region illeg fish territori phillip spent month death work book titl save amazon threat tro rainforest interest illeg fish led trip philip never chanc publish book two day photo taken june journalist guid bruno pereira kill itaquai river illeg fishermen member group caboco photo one last taken phillip almost buri heart amazon forev almost four month two men murder pereira colleagu member indigen patrol within union indigen peopl javari valley univaja discov one pereira phone pile mud stick photo time discoveri team accompani journalist member forbidden stori consortium nia bridi make documentari globo colleagu went back crime scene metal detector find evid bridi told forbidden stori found dom glass notebook wet cant read anyth press card team turn everyth feder polic bridi ad discoveri contain crucial element help reconstruct last moment two men live confirm sequenc event determin polic investig took month work simpli power phone extract data abl access photo unexpect phone spent month water river level went bridi said final photo entrust media organ make bruno dom project led forbidden stori continu work pereira phillip destruct amazon past year group journalist investig land grab ranch tie deforest mine illeg fish investig ultim cost two defend amazon live
Italy calls on the Louvre to return seven of its archaeological objects,    Investigations by archaeologists have led to the identification of half a dozen works of questionable provenance in the Paris museum's collections. ,"For lovers of Greek, Etruscan and Roman art, the Louvre's Galerie Campana, named after the marquis whose collection was acquired by Napoleon III, is an absolute must. Its rooms reopened to the public at the beginning of July after renovation. They are brimming with splendid relics of the ancient world. On display is an amphora on a black background, dating from the 5th century BC, attributed to the ""Berlin painter,"" one of the great masters of Greek pottery, whose style has been identified but whose identity is still unknown. On one side, a musician in profile plays the zither. On the other, a laurel-crowned figure extends his arm in an inviting gesture.The museum’s caption omits one detail. Le Monde, confirmed by the Louvre, found that the Italian state is reclaiming this object along with six other archaeological pieces.The museum purchased them between 1982 and 1998, at a time when curators the world over were focusing their attention on the authenticity of the works, forgetting to consider their provenance. A still ongoing inquiry could lead to a historic agreement between France and Italy in the autumn. Recognition of the Paris museum's problematic purchases did not come from out of nowhere, however. It has been some ten years since suspicion was first aroused and dialogue started between the two countries.The story goes back to 1995. In the secrecy of Geneva's free port, Swiss and Italian police raided the warehouse of a shady Italian merchant, Giacomo Medici, and came across an incredible haul. In addition to thousands of clandestinely excavated objects, the investigators discovered 5000 Polaroids, like inventory cards listing works at various stages, from exhumation to pre-sale restoration.This mass of documents, which served as evidence in a resounding trial in 2003, enabled the entire chain to be traced, from the tombaroli (""grave robbers""), hired hands who clandestinely unearthed the objects, to the auction houses and merchants. Those well-established dealers took it upon themselves to launder the freshly exhumed relics, selling them to museums and prestigious collectors.Gianfranco Becchina, a Sicilian antique dealer who owns the Palladion Gallery in Basel, is one of those. He is a supplier to American billionaire Shelby White, donor of the Metropolitan Museum, and her husband, Leon Levy, as well as to the Getty Villa in Malibu. But he also supplied the Louvre, who bought several important objects from him: a krater of suitors, a magnificent example of an antique vase by the painter of Ixion; another krater in the style of the Antimenes Painter, decorated with a mythological scene; and a pair of nereids (marine nymphs) from Puglia.",Investigations,lovers greek etruscan roman art louvres galerie campana named marquis whose collection acquired napoleon iii absolute must rooms reopened public beginning july renovation brimming splendid relics ancient world display amphora black background dating century attributed berlin painter one great masters greek pottery whose style identified whose identity still unknown one side musician profile plays zither laurel crowned figure extends arm inviting gesture museum caption omits one detail monde confirmed louvre found italian state reclaiming object along six archaeological pieces museum purchased time curators world focusing attention authenticity works forgetting consider provenance still ongoing inquiry could lead historic agreement france italy autumn recognition paris museums problematic purchases come nowhere however ten years since sus first aroused dialogue started two countries story goes back secrecy genevas free port swiss italian police raided warehouse shady italian merchant giacomo medici came across incredible haul addition thousands clandestinely excavated objects investigators discovered polaroids like inventory cards listing works various stages exhumation pre sale restoration mass documents served evidence resounding trial enabled entire chain traced tombaroli grave robbers hired hands clandestinely unearthed objects auction houses merchants well established dealers took upon launder freshly exhumed relics selling museums prestigious collectors gianfranco becchina sicilian antique dealer owns palladion gallery basel one supplier american billionaire shelby white donor metropolitan museum husband leon levy well getty villa malibu also supplied louvre bought several important objects krater suitors magnificent example antique vase painter ixion another krater style antimenes painter decorated mythological scene pair nereids marine nymphs puglia,lover greek etruscan roman art louvr galeri campana name marqui whose collect acquir napoleon iii absolut must room reopen public begin juli renov brim splendid relic ancient world display amphora black background date centuri attribut berlin painter one great master greek potteri whose style identifi whose ident still unknown one side musician profil play zither laurel crown figur extend arm invit gestur museum caption omit one detail mond confirm louvr found italian state reclaim object along six archaeolog piec museum purchas time curat world focus attent authent work forget consid proven still ongo inquiri could lead histor agreement franc itali autumn recognit pari museum problemat purchas come nowher howev ten year sinc su first arous dialogu start two countri stori goe back secreci geneva free port swiss italian polic raid warehous shadi italian merchant giacomo medici came across incred haul addit thousand clandestin excav object investig discov polaroid like inventori card list work variou stage exhum pre sale restor mass document serv evid resound trial enabl entir chain trace tombaroli grave robber hire hand clandestin unearth object auction hous merchant well establish dealer took upon launder freshli exhum relic sell museum prestigi collector gianfranco becchina sicilian antiqu dealer own palladion galleri basel one supplier american billionair shelbi white donor metropolitan museum husband leon levi well getti villa malibu also suppli louvr bought sever import object krater suitor magnific exampl antiqu vase painter ixion anoth krater style antimen painter decor mytholog scene pair nereid marin nymph puglia
Gérard Depardieu: The decline of a sacred monster of French cinema,Investigation,"On Monday, April 10, Gérard Depardieu had an appointment with Intertalent, the artistic agency headed by the literary agent François Samuelson. It was no more than two kilometers from his Parisian hôtel particulier on Rue du Cherche-Midi to the agent's offices on Rue Gay-Lussac, almost in a straight line along the Jardin du Luxembourg. He traveled the distance on his scooter. How many neighbors see this imposing figure every day, without daring to approach him? Weighing in at 130 kilograms beneath that strange little helmet, whose straps he never fastens, he makes even the powerful Yamaha TMax look like a simple pétrolette, as they would call those flimsy 1950s mopeds in Châteauroux, his childhood town. The actor sometimes rides up the street in the wrong direction. All at once known, he is known to everyone, unattainable, linked to countless cinema memories – and out of line.His reason for visiting Samuelson could be summed up in one short sentence: ""Things are not going well for Michel Houellebecq,"" the writer's longtime agent warned him. After several critically acclaimed bestsellers, Houellebecq's reputation was gradually cracking under the weight of his provocations. From his blistering attacks on Islam, immigrants and feminists, to the porn film shot with his wife and broadcast without her permission, Houellebecq, who used to love controversy, could no longer stand his tarnished image.He and Depardieu hadn't seen each other since Guillaume Nicloux's film Thalasso (Just Great, 2019), in which they play two spa-goers at a thalassotherapy in Cabourg, Normandy, but the actor is well familiar with the pain of disenchantment. He, too, went from being an idolized titan to a man whose friends had given up trying to excuse all his faults.That day, at Intertalent, he grabbed one of his three cell phones and called Houellebecq. When the conversation ended, he immediately decided to pay him a visit. Just as he was about to go to the door and put on his helmet, Samuelson stopped him. As a matter of conscience, he wanted to make sure of one thing: ""Tell me Gérard, are you aware that tomorrow an investigation will be published by [investigative website] Mediapart, in which several women accuse you of sexual violence on film shoots?"" He grunted, shrugged, and then he was off again.For years, scandal trailed him, and for years, it did not stop him. Does he think this can keep up? That the dozens of masterpieces that made him the greatest French actor of the last 50 years can forever erase the injuries caused by his drunken motorcycle accidents, the groping of make-up artists and technical staff, the scenes of drunken violence on set requiring a doctor to quickly administer a sedative shot, the vociferous support for Vladimir Putin, and the photos showing him red-faced and grinning alongside dictators from around the world?",Investigations,monday april rard depardieu appointment intertalent artistic agency headed literary agent fran ois samuelson two kilometers parisian tel particulier rue cherche midi agents offices rue gay lussac almost straight line along jardin luxembourg traveled distance scooter many neighbors see imposing figure every day without daring approach weighing kilograms beneath strange little helmet whose straps never fastens makes even powerful yamaha tmax look like simple trolette would call flimsy mopeds teauroux childhood town actor sometimes rides street wrong direction known known everyone unattainable linked countless cinema memories line reason visiting samuelson could summed one short sentence things going well michel houellebecq writers longtime agent warned several critically acclaimed bestsellers houellebecqs reputation gradually cracking weight provocations blistering attacks islam immigrants feminists porn film shot wife broadcast without permission houellebecq used love controversy could longer stand tarnished image depardieu hadnt seen since guillaume niclouxs film thalasso great play two spa goers thalassotherapy cabourg normandy actor well familiar pain disenchantment went idolized titan man whose friends given trying excuse faults day intertalent grabbed one three cell phones called houellebecq conversation ended immediately decided pay visit door put helmet samuelson stopped matter conscience wanted make sure one thing tell rard aware tomorrow investigation published investigative website mediapart several women accuse sexual violence film shoots grunted shrugged years scandal trailed years stop think keep dozens masterpieces made greatest french actor last years forever erase injuries caused drunken motorcycle accidents groping make artists technical staff scenes drunken violence set requiring doctor quickly administer sedative shot vociferous support vladimir putin photos showing red faced grinning alongside dictators around world,monday april rard depardieu appoint intertal artist agenc head literari agent fran oi samuelson two kilomet parisian tel particuli rue cherch midi agent offic rue gay lussac almost straight line along jardin luxembourg travel distanc scooter mani neighbor see impos figur everi day without dare approach weigh kilogram beneath strang littl helmet whose strap never fasten make even power yamaha tmax look like simpl trolett would call flimsi mope teauroux childhood town actor sometim ride street wrong direct known known everyon unattain link countless cinema memori line reason visit samuelson could sum one short sentenc thing go well michel houellebecq writer longtim agent warn sever critic acclaim bestsel houellebecq reput gradual crack weight provoc blister attack islam immigr feminist porn film shot wife broadcast without permiss houellebecq use love controversi could longer stand tarnish imag depardieu hadnt seen sinc guillaum nicloux film thalasso great play two spa goer thalassotherapi cabourg normandi actor well familiar pain disenchant went idol titan man whose friend given tri excus fault day intertal grab one three cell phone call houellebecq convers end immedi decid pay visit door put helmet samuelson stop matter conscienc want make sure one thing tell rard awar tomorrow investig publish investig websit mediapart sever women accus sexual violenc film shoot grunt shrug year scandal trail year stop think keep dozen masterpiec made greatest french actor last year forev eras injuri caus drunken motorcycl accid grope make artist technic staff scene drunken violenc set requir doctor quickli administ sed shot vocifer support vladimir putin photo show red face grin alongsid dictat around world
Uber Files: French Parliament Commission says government 'failed to enforce the law',"    One year after Le Monde and its partners' revelations about Uber's lobbying, French lawmakers condemned the authorities' weakness and Emmanuel Macron's complacency in a report published on Tuesday. ","How did a company with such contempt for the law benefit from so much leniency? The question repeatedly arises throughout a 500-page report by a commission of inquiry of the Assemblée Nationale into the Uber Files. Published on Tuesday, July 18, the document is the result of six months of work during which members of parliament interviewed up to 120 individuals. It highlights multiple shortcomings in how government services reacted to the development of Uber and other similar platforms in France.The case began with a series of articles published by Le Monde and its International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) partners in July last year, focusing on the transport platform's operations in France and beyond. The investigation was based on numerous internal documents sent to the British daily The Guardian by Mark MacGann, Uber's chief lobbyist for Europe, from 2014 to 2016. They reveal how the company deliberately circumvented regulations to gain a foothold against taxis and its influence strategy, particularly in France, where it forged a close relationship with President Emmanuel Macron when he was minister of the economy.Danielle Simonnet, an MP with the radical-left party La France Insoumise (LFI) and the main instigator of the commission, took up and extended these revelations in her report. It used the same documents but also drew on hearings of some key players in the case – except for former members of Macron's cabinet – and new, more recent evidence.Former Socialist prime minister Manuel Valls and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, both in office at the time of the Uber Files, told the commission the government stood firm when faced with the platform's ""total cynicism."" But they failed to convince MPs, who concluded instead authorities had ""failed to enforce the law."" Uber, they point out, launched its UberPop private-driver service in France from early 2014 to July 2015, at a time when it was blatantly unlawful. They also found two pieces of legislation passed during the mandate of former French president François Hollande in response to the platform's malpractices – the Thévenoud Law (2014) and the Grandguillaume Law (2016) – are still partly circumvented.According to the report, the fault lies with isolated and often inconclusive procedures. Jérôme Fournel, a top official at the finance ministry, acknowledged the lack of cooperation from the Dutch tax authorities and a slow bureaucracy restricted his ability to take action. The report also mentions the case of an inspection carried out by URSSAF (a network of private organizations in charge of collecting social security contributions), which was overturned in court due to a formal defect without the organization seeing fit to re-launch proceedings. It also cites the example of Nathalie Homobono, the head of a finance ministry competition body from 2009 to 2018, who admitted having discovered the company's tactics to sabotage controls and the work of the justice system after the Uber Files case was disclosed while saying it had not hindered its investigations.",Investigations,company contempt law benefit much leniency question repeatedly arises throughout page report commission inquiry assembl nationale uber files published tuesday july document result six months work members parliament interviewed individuals highlights multiple shortcomings government services reacted development uber similar platforms france case began series articles published monde international consortium investigative journalists icij partners july last year focusing transport platforms operations france beyond investigation based numerous internal documents sent british daily guardian mark macgann ubers chief lobbyist europe reveal company deliberately circumvented regulations gain foothold taxis influence strategy particularly france forged close relationship president emmanuel macron minister economy danielle simonnet radical left party france insoumise lfi main instigator commission took extended revelations report used documents also drew hearings key players case except former members macrons cabinet new recent evidence former socialist prime minister manuel valls interior minister bernard cazeneuve office time uber files told commission government stood firm faced platforms total cynicism failed convince mps concluded instead authorities failed enforce law uber point launched uberpop private driver service france early july time blatantly unlawful also found two pieces legislation passed mandate former french president fran ois hollande response platforms malpractices venoud law grandguillaume law still partly circumvented according report fault lies isolated often inconclusive procedures fournel top official finance ministry acknowledged lack cooperation dutch tax authorities slow bureaucracy restricted ability take action report also mentions case inspection carried urssaf network private organizations charge collecting social security contributions overturned court due formal defect without organization seeing fit launch proceedings also cites example nathalie homobono head finance ministry competition body admitted discovered companys tactics sabotage controls work justice system uber files case disclosed saying hindered investigations,compani contempt law benefit much lenienc question repeatedli aris throughout page report commiss inquiri assembl national uber file publish tuesday juli document result six month work member parliament interview individu highlight multipl shortcom govern servic react develop uber similar platform franc case began seri articl publish mond intern consortium investig journalist icij partner juli last year focus transport platform oper franc beyond investig base numer intern document sent british daili guardian mark macgann uber chief lobbyist europ reveal compani deliber circumv regul gain foothold taxi influenc strategi particularli franc forg close relationship presid emmanuel macron minist economi daniel simonnet radic left parti franc insoumis lfi main instig commiss took extend revel report use document also drew hear key player case except former member macron cabinet new recent evid former socialist prime minist manuel vall interior minist bernard cazeneuv offic time uber file told commiss govern stood firm face platform total cynic fail convinc mp conclud instead author fail enforc law uber point launch uberpop privat driver servic franc earli juli time blatantli unlaw also found two piec legisl pass mandat former french presid fran oi holland respons platform malpractic venoud law grandguillaum law still partli circumv accord report fault lie isol often inconclus procedur fournel top offici financ ministri acknowledg lack cooper dutch tax author slow bureaucraci restrict abil take action report also mention case inspect carri urssaf network privat organ charg collect social secur contribut overturn court due formal defect without organ see fit launch proceed also cite exampl nathali homobono head financ ministri competit bodi admit discov compani tactic sabotag control work justic system uber file case disclos say hinder investig
"Looking for Roman Abramovich, the human chameleon",Investigation,"The meeting, we were told, would be in suite 1288 at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Herzliya, an upmarket northern suburb of Tel Aviv, Israel. But there was a problem: The room doesn't exist. ""Excuse my indiscretion,"" said a member of the hotel staff, near the pool, ""Are you looking for the Russian gentleman with bodyguards?"" Yes. Roman Abramovich, 56, the powerful oligarch reputedly close to President Vladimir Putin. As if by magic, a door opened at the end of the corridor. Inside, there was no trace of the billionaire, who had come to the Israeli coast to spend the summer with his entourage. He hasn't spoken to the press for a long time, and that stormy June afternoon would be no exception.Instead, one of the businessman's long-standing associates, Henry, and his spokesperson for the past eight years, Olga (their names were changed at their request), welcomed us to a chilly white décor and a private terrace overlooking the sea. With a can of Diet Coke and a pack of cigarettes on the table, Olga told the stories of her Russian-Lebanese-Swedish origins, of her violent father, and the daughter she is raising alone, supported by her boss. ""Her birth coincided with the pandemic, and we lived in an apartment next to Stamford Bridge, Chelsea's deserted stadium,"" she said, referring to the London-based football club owned by Abramovich from 2003 to 2022. ""Roman insisted that I continue to work for him, even if it meant taking my baby to meetings. He likes to surround himself with colleagues who, like him, have been through a lot.""From the mid-1990s, a coterie of a dozen people has followed the tycoon at almost every stage in the construction of his empire: his oil ventures, in Russia; his political career in Chukotka, the country's easternmost region; his London life; and the many start-ups and vast real estate holdings in which he has invested in Israel. Not one member of his loyal clan has ever betrayed the oligarch whose fortune is estimated at a little over $9 billion, down from $14.5 billion in 2021. ""I would never work for anyone else,"" said Henry, formerly of an American investment bank, and who has long worked with the Russian. He lauded Abramovich's ""sixth sense"" and his obsession with results. According to him, the oligarch is constantly looking to ""fix things,"" without ever seeking ""the slightest attention.""Attentive but shunning attention: such is this billionaire's paradox. A key figure in modern Russia, preferring behind-the-scenes discretion to taking center stage, he has nevertheless become the most famed and secretive of the so-called oligarchs – the entrepreneurs who profited from privatizations by cozying up to the Kremlin, when the Eastern bloc disintegrated. His fame is the result of his extraordinary career trajectory, which kept pace with Russia's evolutions, from perestroika to Putin's authoritarian drift. At age 3, he was an orphan of a Soviet-Jewish family; later he became the patron of the cultural avant-garde and the Jewish community. Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine, he is even a discreet diplomat. He knows how to make himself indispensable.",Investigations,meeting told would suite ritz carlton hotel herzliya upmarket northern suburb tel aviv israel problem room doesnt exist excuse indiscretion said member hotel staff near pool looking russian gentleman bodyguards yes roman abramovich powerful oligarch reputedly close president vladimir putin magic door opened end corridor inside trace billionaire come israeli coast spend summer entourage hasnt spoken press long time stormy june afternoon would exception instead one businessmans long standing associates henry spokesperson past eight years olga names changed request welcomed chilly white cor private terrace overlooking sea diet coke pack cigarettes table olga told stories russian lebanese swedish origins violent father daughter raising alone supported boss birth coincided pandemic lived apartment next stamford bridge chelseas deserted stadium said referring london based football club owned abramovich roman insisted continue work even meant taking baby meetings likes surround colleagues like lot mid coterie dozen people followed tycoon almost every stage construction empire oil ventures russia political career chukotka countrys easternmost region london life many start ups vast real estate holdings invested israel one member loyal clan ever betrayed oligarch whose fortune estimated little billion billion would never work anyone else said henry formerly american investment bank long worked russian lauded abramovichs sixth sense obsession results according oligarch constantly looking fix things without ever seeking slightest attention attentive shunning attention billionaires paradox key figure modern russia preferring behind scenes discretion taking center stage nevertheless become famed secretive called oligarchs entrepreneurs profited privatizations cozying kremlin eastern bloc disintegrated fame result extraordinary career trajectory kept pace russias evolutions perestroika putins authoritarian drift age orphan soviet jewish family later became patron cultural avant garde jewish community since outbreak war ukraine even discreet diplomat knows make indispensable,meet told would suit ritz carlton hotel herzliya upmarket northern suburb tel aviv israel problem room doesnt exist excus indiscret said member hotel staff near pool look russian gentleman bodyguard ye roman abramovich power oligarch reputedli close presid vladimir putin magic door open end corridor insid trace billionair come isra coast spend summer entourag hasnt spoken press long time stormi june afternoon would except instead one businessman long stand associ henri spokesperson past eight year olga name chang request welcom chilli white cor privat terrac overlook sea diet coke pack cigarett tabl olga told stori russian lebanes swedish origin violent father daughter rais alon support boss birth coincid pandem live apart next stamford bridg chelsea desert stadium said refer london base footbal club own abramovich roman insist continu work even meant take babi meet like surround colleagu like lot mid coteri dozen peopl follow tycoon almost everi stage construct empir oil ventur russia polit career chukotka countri easternmost region london life mani start up vast real estat hold invest israel one member loyal clan ever betray oligarch whose fortun estim littl billion billion would never work anyon els said henri formerli american invest bank long work russian laud abramovich sixth sens obsess result accord oligarch constantli look fix thing without ever seek slightest attent attent shun attent billionair paradox key figur modern russia prefer behind scene discret take center stage nevertheless becom fame secret call oligarch entrepreneur profit privat cozi kremlin eastern bloc disintegr fame result extraordinari career trajectori kept pace russia evolut perestroika putin authoritarian drift age orphan soviet jewish famili later becam patron cultur avant gard jewish commun sinc outbreak war ukrain even discreet diplomat know make indispens
"Roman Abramovich the 'invisible man,' a business and survival specialist",Investigation,"Roman Abramovich had never revealed his face. He had never let anyone photograph him. In the late 1990s, when his name flooded the Russian media, the young oligarch remained invisible. The press had to commission rough illustrations of the businessman, who ran the oil giant Sibneft, employing tens of thousands of people across the country. ""During a lecture the politician Boris Nemtsov delivered at Oxford University in 1998, he was even asked if Abramovich really existed,"" said Nigel Gould-Davis, a former British diplomat in Russia (2003-2007) and ambassador to Belarus (2007-2009).Also in 1998, the NTV channel launched a competition for its viewers to debunk conspiracy theories, offering a prize of 1 million rubles (around $2,000) for the very first photo of the enigmatic 30-something. Less than two months later, NTV received a photo, but the man in the picture had a mustache: It wasn't Abramovich. The prize would ultimately be won thanks to a blurry photo, where the tycoon's face, calm eyes, his composed demeanor were barely even discernible. It was enough to make headlines in every paper. He had become a public figure.Behind the scenes, the businessman had the best allies, and secured a prominent place among the national elite. In 1996, President Boris Yeltsin was re-elected for a second four-year term. Together with Boris Berezovsky, Abramovich had financed part of his campaign, with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in charge of gathering the funds. Abramovich began spending entire days in the Kremlin's corridors with Tatyana Dyachenko, the president's daughter. The 36-year-old former Soviet aerospace worker acted as an informal adviser to her father, a role inspired by Claude Chirac's position alongside her father Jacques Chirac, the French president who came to Moscow on an official visit at that time.As Yeltsin's health declined after multiple heart attacks, his youngest daughter asserted herself in the various power struggles. The ""tsarina"" and""little princess of the Kremlin,"" as she was nicknamed by the press, consolidated the support of loyal followers, including Alexander Voloshin, the deputy head of the presidential administration, and Valentin Yumashev, Yeltsin's new spokesman, who Dyachenko married in 2001.

Roman Abramovich's new promised land,Investigation,"Roman Abramovich's biggest yacht is called Eclipse, a reminder of how much he likes to lurk in the shadows. But on May 29, 2021, the oligarch's joy was expressed out in the open. In front of photographers at Porto's Dragon Stadium, he posed radiantly alongside two of his seven children, Arkadiy and Aaron. The team he bought in 2003, Chelsea Football Club, had just won its second Champions League.It was the first time in almost three years that the businessman had appeared alongside his players. While the UK had long welcomed Russian money with open arms, conditions were tightened after the attempted poisoning of double agent Sergei Skripal in March 2018. Abramovich immediately paid the price: His visa was not renewed. He was left with no choice but to follow his team's matches on television, from abroad.His public reappearance on the Porto pitch drew significant attention. Newspapers gossiped about the symbolism of his victory on the home turf of José Mourinho, the most petulant coach in Chelsea's history. Nobody knew that Portugal was now the Chelsea owner's home. One month before the final, on April 30, 2021, Abramovich had officially become a citizen of the country, in the greatest secrecy.The Russian made use of a law on the return of Sephardic Jews, passed in 2013 and enacted in 2015, granting citizenship to any Jew who can prove they belong to this community. The legislation was meant as a belated attempt from Portugal to repair the damage done to the community during the reign of Manuel I (1469-1521), when Jews suffered from pogroms, expulsions, and forced conversions to Christianity. Incidentally, it was also an opportunity for the country to attract new investors, after being bled dry by the 2008 economic crisis.The prospect of becoming a citizen of the European Union boosted the number of applicants. As a result, the Portuguese government and the Jewish communities of Lisbon and Porto were overwhelmed. To date, almost 200,000 passport applications have been submitted; by the end of 2021, 57,000 had been accepted.These neo-Portuguese come in all shapes and sizes: footballers, a former head of Mossad (Israel's intelligence service), rabbis, and some very wealthy people. One of them was the Russian businessman, whose biographies until then all suggested – wrongly, if he is to be believed – that he belonged to the Ashkenazi, not Sephardic, branch of Judaism.""One day, someone advised me to look up Roman Abramovich's Portuguese Wikipedia page,"" said Paulo Curado, the journalist from the newspaper Publico who broke the story in November 2021. ""It was much longer than the English version; it was the only one, incidentally, to mention his Sephardic origins... After investigating, I found that his application had been processed in record time.""",Investigations,roman abramovichs biggest yacht called eclipse reminder much likes lurk shadows may oligarchs joy expressed open front photographers portos dragon stadium posed radiantly alongside two seven children arkadiy aaron team bought chelsea football club second champions league first time almost three years businessman appeared alongside players long welcomed russian money open arms conditions tightened attempted poisoning double agent sergei skripal march abramovich immediately paid price visa renewed left choice follow teams matches television abroad public reappearance porto pitch drew significant attention newspapers gossiped symbolism victory home turf jos mourinho petulant coach chelseas history nobody knew portugal chelsea owners home one month final april abramovich officially become citizen country greatest secrecy russian made use law return sephardic jews passed enacted granting citizenship jew prove belong community legislation meant belated attempt portugal repair damage done community reign manuel jews suffered pogroms expulsions forced conversions christianity incidentally also opportunity country attract new investors bled dry economic crisis prospect becoming citizen european union boosted number applicants result portuguese government jewish communities lisbon porto overwhelmed date almost passport applications submitted end accepted neo portuguese come shapes sizes footballers former head mossad israels intelligence service rabbis wealthy people one russian businessman whose biographies suggested wrongly believed belonged ashkenazi sephardic branch judaism one day someone advised look roman abramovichs portuguese wikipedia page said paulo curado journalist newspaper publico broke story november much longer english version one incidentally mention sephardic origins investigating found application processed record time,roman abramovich biggest yacht call eclips remind much like lurk shadow may oligarch joy express open front photograph porto dragon stadium pose radiantli alongsid two seven children arkadiy aaron team bought chelsea footbal club second champion leagu first time almost three year businessman appear alongsid player long welcom russian money open arm condit tighten attempt poison doubl agent sergei skripal march abramovich immedi paid price visa renew left choic follow team match televis abroad public reappear porto pitch drew signific attent newspap gossip symbol victori home turf jo mourinho petul coach chelsea histori nobodi knew portug chelsea owner home one month final april abramovich offici becom citizen countri greatest secreci russian made use law return sephard jew pass enact grant citizenship jew prove belong commun legisl meant belat attempt portug repair damag done commun reign manuel jew suffer pogrom expuls forc convers christian incident also opportun countri attract new investor bled dri econom crisi prospect becom citizen european union boost number applic result portugues govern jewish commun lisbon porto overwhelm date almost passport applic submit end accept neo portugues come shape size footbal former head mossad israel intellig servic rabbi wealthi peopl one russian businessman whose biographi suggest wrongli believ belong ashkenazi sephard branch judaism one day someon advis look roman abramovich portugues wikipedia page said paulo curado journalist newspap publico broke stori novemb much longer english version one incident mention sephard origin investig found applic process record time
"Roman Abramovich, from art lover to patron of Russian culture",Investigation,"For a long time, Israel Bartov was the head of counterterrorism for the Shabak, Israel's internal security service (formerly known as the Shin Beth). Though is now retired, he apologized for not being able to share any information about Roman Abramovich. He added a cryptic formula: ""Secrets must be revealed, and mysteries solved."" Former French footballer Marcel Desailly, who rubbed shoulders with the Russian oligarch at Chelsea Football Club, was no more forthcoming: ""Roman Abramovich? Hmm... Sorry. Sensitive subject.""Investigating a man of power means facing refusals to answer questions, and this series of articles was no exception. Most of the nyets we received, however, were accompanied by messages conveying a mixture of fear and fascination. It is as if Abramovich's aura extended beyond his main areas of activity – business, politics, sport – and flirted with arts and culture stars. The Russian businessman knows this world well, having sponsored it profusely over the past 15 years. Thanks to the artists he has helped and financed, he has measured the extent to which celebrity is shrouded in secrecy – a paradox that he has gradually made into a rule to live by.Kirill Serebrennikov would know about that. In May 2022, Russia's most high-profile film director made his comeback to the Cannes Film Festival. He had not been able to climb the festival's steps in 2018 and 2019, because he was under house arrest in his country. At the press conference, most of the questions were not about his films or his run-ins with the law, but about Abramovich's unwavering support for him. The star of the day was not the artist whose pro-LGBT and anti-war commitments had earned him the wrath of the regime, but his enigmatic patron, the man who had shunned the press for decades.On the Croisette, journalists rehashed more or less the same questions, stirred up by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February: What prompted the oligarch reputedly close to Vladimir Putin to finance the films and shows of such a non-conformist artist? Why, in early 2022, did he pay the bulk of the fine – 129 million rubles (nearly €1.3 million) – imposed on Serebrennikov, effectively giving him back his freedom of movement and creation? ""Abramovich, you can’t understand anything about him,"" the director told Le Monde, with a hint of fatalism. ""He has something inaccessible, unattainable. It fascinates everyone.""If we are to go by what has emerged from his biography, culture has always interested Abramovich. Orphaned at the age of 3 and having never earned a diploma, he discovered it through encounters and contracts. Thanks to his first profits at the time of the liberalization of the Russian economy at the turn of the 1990s, he acquired state-of-the-art hi-fi equipment: record and cassette players, headphones. That was when he began his first art collection. ""When I went to visit him in Moscow for the first time some 15 years ago, Roman showed me his Soviet porcelain,"" recounted Russian visual artist Emilia Kabakov. ""He had been collecting them for almost 20 years.""",Investigations,long time israel bartov head counterterrorism shabak israels internal security service formerly known shin beth though retired apologized able share information roman abramovich added cryptic formula secrets must revealed mysteries solved former french footballer marcel desailly rubbed shoulders russian oligarch chelsea football club forthcoming roman abramovich hmm sorry sensitive subject investigating man power means facing refusals answer questions series articles exception nyets received however accompanied messages conveying mixture fear fascination abramovichs aura extended beyond main areas activity business politics sport flirted arts culture stars russian businessman knows world well sponsored profusely past years thanks artists helped financed measured extent celebrity shrouded secrecy paradox gradually made rule live kirill serebrennikov would know may russias high profile film director made comeback cannes film festival able climb festivals steps house arrest country press conference questions films run ins law abramovichs unwavering support star day artist whose pro lgbt anti war commitments earned wrath regime enigmatic patron man shunned press decades croisette journalists rehashed less questions stirred russias invasion ukraine february prompted oligarch reputedly close vladimir putin finance films shows non conformist artist early pay bulk fine million rubles nearly million imposed serebrennikov effectively giving back freedom movement creation abramovich understand anything director told monde hint fatalism something inaccessible unattainable fascinates everyone emerged biography culture always interested abramovich orphaned age never earned diploma discovered encounters contracts thanks first profits time liberalization russian economy turn acquired state art equipment record cassette players headphones began first art collection went visit moscow first time years ago roman showed soviet porcelain recounted russian visual artist emilia kabakov collecting almost years,long time israel bartov head counterterror shabak israel intern secur servic formerli known shin beth though retir apolog abl share inform roman abramovich ad cryptic formula secret must reveal mysteri solv former french footbal marcel desailli rub shoulder russian oligarch chelsea footbal club forthcom roman abramovich hmm sorri sensit subject investig man power mean face refus answer question seri articl except nyet receiv howev accompani messag convey mixtur fear fascin abramovich aura extend beyond main area activ busi polit sport flirt art cultur star russian businessman know world well sponsor profus past year thank artist help financ measur extent celebr shroud secreci paradox gradual made rule live kiril serebrennikov would know may russia high profil film director made comeback cann film festiv abl climb festiv step hous arrest countri press confer question film run in law abramovich unwav support star day artist whose pro lgbt anti war commit earn wrath regim enigmat patron man shun press decad croisett journalist rehash less question stir russia invas ukrain februari prompt oligarch reputedli close vladimir putin financ film show non conformist artist earli pay bulk fine million rubl nearli million impos serebrennikov effect give back freedom movement creation abramovich understand anyth director told mond hint fatal someth inaccess unattain fascin everyon emerg biographi cultur alway interest abramovich orphan age never earn diploma discov encount contract thank first profit time liber russian economi turn acquir state art equip record cassett player headphon began first art collect went visit moscow first time year ago roman show soviet porcelain recount russian visual artist emilia kabakov collect almost year
Monaco shaken by investigations into members of Albert II's entourage,"    In mid-July, Monaco's judiciary carried out a series of searches at the homes of four figures reputedly close to the prince and his late father, which could cast a shadow over the family. ","In Monaco, scandal is on the doorstep of the prince's palace. The struggle for influence between a billionaire – local real estate magnate Patrice Pastor – and four men long reputed to be close to Prince Albert II, seems to be turning to the former's advantage. The prince, for his part, has found himself in the middle of a battle whose collateral damage could seriously shake the wealthy micro-state.Following a series of searches carried out in mid-July, Monaco's justice system now has the files of 67-year-old chartered accountant Claude Palmero. An influential yet discreet figure in the principality for two decades, this seasoned manager is the soul of discretion. From November 2001 to June 2023, he held the sensitive position of administrator of the prince of Monaco's assets, and as such, was the keeper of all the principality's secrets – from the prince's personal accounts to government investments. He is the kind of person whose good side you usually try to stay on.His recent ousting on June 6, when he was cited by a mysterious website called ""Les Dossiers du Rocher"", has changed the situation: Under judicial scrutiny, Palmero has become the man who is making the palace quiver. His files, along with the contents of his cell phone, are now in the hands of three of Monaco's investigating judges, and may well speak for him.These items were seized on Wednesday, July 19 during a series of large-scale searches carried out not only in Monaco but also in Nice and Paris, as part of international letters rogatory. In addition to Palmero, whose offices, private home, and second residence were searched, three other figures reputedly close to the prince, and now in disgrace, were targeted by police operations: Thierry Lacoste, lawyer, and childhood friend of Albert II, Didier Linotte, president of the supreme court – a kind of local Constitutional Council, and Laurent Anselmi, former head of the prince's cabinet, who was also dismissed in June.This judicial offensive came as a surprise to the four men, who see themselves as victims of a machination hatched by the sponsors of the ""Dossiers du Rocher,"" of which they are, in fact, the targets. In the spring of 2022, Le Monde reported in detail on this incredible operation of manipulation and digital allegation, with the juicy local real estate market as a backdrop.Presented by ""Les Dossiers du Rocher"" as members of a supposedly corrupt ""club of four,"" against a backdrop of thirst for real estate, Palmero and his friends filed a flurry of complaints for ""public defamation"" and ""slanderous allegations,"" as well as ""violation of the confidentiality of correspondence,"" since their e-mail boxes were hacked. They also filed complaints for ""forgery and use of forgeries"" because false bank statements had been posted online.",Investigations,monaco scandal doorstep princes palace struggle influence billionaire local real estate magnate patrice pastor four men long reputed close prince albert seems turning formers advantage prince part found middle battle whose collateral damage could seriously shake wealthy micro state following series searches carried mid july monacos justice system files year old chartered accountant claude palmero influential yet discreet figure principality two decades seasoned manager soul discretion november june held sensitive position administrator prince monacos assets keeper principalitys secrets princes personal accounts government investments kind person whose good side usually try stay recent ousting june cited mysterious website called les dossiers rocher changed situation judicial scrutiny palmero become man making palace quiver files along contents cell phone hands three monacos investigating judges may well speak items seized wednesday july series large scale searches carried monaco also nice paris part international letters rogatory addition palmero whose offices private home second residence searched three figures reputedly close prince disgrace targeted police operations thierry lacoste lawyer childhood friend albert didier linotte president supreme court kind local constitutional council laurent anselmi former head princes cabinet also dismissed june judicial offensive came surprise four men see victims machination hatched sponsors dossiers rocher fact targets spring monde reported detail incredible operation manipulation digital allegation juicy local real estate market backdrop presented les dossiers rocher members supposedly corrupt club four backdrop thirst real estate palmero friends filed flurry complaints public defamation slanderous allegations well violation confidentiality correspondence since mail boxes hacked also filed complaints forgery use forgeries false bank statements posted online,monaco scandal doorstep princ palac struggl influenc billionair local real estat magnat patric pastor four men long reput close princ albert seem turn former advantag princ part found middl battl whose collater damag could serious shake wealthi micro state follow seri search carri mid juli monaco justic system file year old charter account claud palmero influenti yet discreet figur princip two decad season manag soul discret novemb june held sensit posit administr princ monaco asset keeper princip secret princ person account govern invest kind person whose good side usual tri stay recent oust june cite mysteri websit call le dossier rocher chang situat judici scrutini palmero becom man make palac quiver file along content cell phone hand three monaco investig judg may well speak item seiz wednesday juli seri larg scale search carri monaco also nice pari part intern letter rogatori addit palmero whose offic privat home second resid search three figur reputedli close princ disgrac target polic oper thierri lacost lawyer childhood friend albert didier linott presid suprem court kind local constitut council laurent anselmi former head princ cabinet also dismiss june judici offens came surpris four men see victim machin hatch sponsor dossier rocher fact target spring mond report detail incred oper manipul digit alleg juici local real estat market backdrop present le dossier rocher member supposedli corrupt club four backdrop thirst real estat palmero friend file flurri complaint public defam slander alleg well violat confidenti correspond sinc mail box hack also file complaint forgeri use forgeri fals bank statement post onlin
El Salvador in the grip of the 'Bukele system',Investigation,"Nayib Bukele has won a war. The Salvadoran president often boasts on Twitter: ""We're not the same anymore."" Four years of ""Bukeleism"" have changed the face of El Salvador. Its 6.6 million nationals adore him, someot idolize him. He succeeded where all the others failed in defeating the pandillas, the gangs that have bloodied the country – and the Central American region – for more than two decades. Almost every day, Bukele tweets to his 5.2 million followers: ""Another day with zero homicides,"" an assertion that has an undeniable impact when seven years earlier, there were almost 20 murders a day in the country.The changes were noticeable when strolling through the streets of San Salvador, the capital. That day, children were playing football in a square. A couple was about to enjoy a drink on a terrace. A woman visited a friend. These scenes of everyday life were unthinkable just two years ago when gangs were sowing terror, extorting money from businesses, controlling entrances and exits to neighborhoods, threatening residents, and even banning the brands of sneakers worn by rival gangs.The turning point came on March 27, 2022. After a particularly deadly weekend – authorities reported 87 murders – that undermined his stated policy of reducing crime, the president declared a war on gangs, greeted by the applause of an exasperated population. He also declared a state of emergency, which is still in force today. He deployed the army in the streets, surrounded entire towns to root out gang members, the pandilleros, and threw 70,000 people into prison. As a result, 1.6% of the population is now behind bars, the highest incarceration rate in the world. One year and three months later, the facts are striking. The investigative website El Faro verified this by visiting 14 towns previously under criminal groups' thumb. ""The gangs do not exist at this moment as El Salvador knew them for decades,"" it writes.Bukele, 41, is delighted. In the past, El Faro vilified his strategy against the pandilleros and the international community urged him to respect the rights of the detainees. ""Let all the 'human rights' non-governmental organizations know we will wipe out these bloody murderers and their collaborators. We will put them in prison, and they will never get out,"" he tweeted again on May 17, after the murder of a police officer. Under his tweet were hundreds of replies from ministers, lawmakers, civil servants, journalists close to the government, and influencers, all determined to applaud, even praise, the most beloved president of the American continent. A CID Gallup study recently reported he enjoys a 92% popularity rating.",Investigations,nayib bukele war salvadoran president often boasts twitter anymore four years bukeleism changed face salvador million nationals adore someot idolize succeeded others failed defeating pandillas gangs bloodied country central american region two decades almost every day bukele tweets million followers another day zero homicides assertion undeniable impact seven years earlier almost murders day country changes noticeable strolling streets san salvador capital day children playing football square couple enjoy drink terrace woman visited friend scenes everyday life unthinkable two years ago gangs sowing terror extorting money businesses controlling entrances exits neighborhoods threatening residents even banning brands sneakers worn rival gangs turning point came march particularly deadly weekend authorities reported murders undermined stated policy reducing crime president declared war gangs greeted applause exasperated population also declared state emergency still force today deployed army streets surrounded entire towns root gang members pandilleros threw people prison result population behind bars highest incarceration rate world one year three months later facts striking investigative website faro verified visiting towns previously criminal groups thumb gangs exist moment salvador knew decades writes bukele delighted past faro vilified strategy pandilleros international community urged respect rights detainees let human rights non governmental organizations know wipe bloody murderers collaborators put prison never get tweeted may murder police officer tweet hundreds replies ministers lawmakers civil servants journalists close government influencers determined applaud even praise beloved president american continent cid gallup study recently reported enjoys popularity rating,nayib bukel war salvadoran presid often boast twitter anymor four year bukel chang face salvador million nation ador someot idol succeed other fail defeat pandilla gang bloodi countri central american region two decad almost everi day bukel tweet million follow anoth day zero homicid assert undeni impact seven year earlier almost murder day countri chang notic stroll street san salvador capit day children play footbal squar coupl enjoy drink terrac woman visit friend scene everyday life unthink two year ago gang sow terror extort money busi control entranc exit neighborhood threaten resid even ban brand sneaker worn rival gang turn point came march particularli deadli weekend author report murder undermin state polici reduc crime presid declar war gang greet applaus exasper popul also declar state emerg still forc today deploy armi street surround entir town root gang member pandillero threw peopl prison result popul behind bar highest incarcer rate world one year three month later fact strike investig websit faro verifi visit town previous crimin group thumb gang exist moment salvador knew decad write bukel delight past faro vilifi strategi pandillero intern commun urg respect right detaine let human right non government organ know wipe bloodi murder collabor put prison never get tweet may murder polic offic tweet hundr repli minist lawmak civil servant journalist close govern influenc determin applaud even prais belov presid american contin cid gallup studi recent report enjoy popular rate
How the Russian propaganda machine works in Africa,"    The Wagner Group has conquered the continent with the help of its mercenaries, as well as fake news outlets and influencers, drawing on a strong rejection of the West in general – and France in particular. ","In the early hours of the Russia-Africa summit, a rumor was gaining ground: Was Yevgeny Prigozhin in St. Petersburg to work behind the scenes on the meeting that would take place on Thursday, July 27, and Friday, July 28? Suspicions intensified further when one of the Wagner leader's loyal lieutenants, Dmitry Sytyi, in charge of the paramilitary group's political and civil operations in Bangui, posted a photo of Prigozhin and a Central African official, captioned: ""We see familiar faces"" – although it could not be determined when the image was taken.Whether there in the flesh or not, the man who led an unsuccessful rebellion against Russia a month ago was a key player in the second edition of the summit organized by Vladimir Putin, as he played a vital role in Russia's expansion in Africa. ""Africa is a region of the world where the interests of all global powers converge. A state's position on the international stage depends directly on its influence on the African continent,"" wrote the Wagner Group in 2019, in an internal memo seen by Le Monde.Prigozhin's conquest of certain African countries has been achieved not only by his mercenaries but also by his bots and troll machines, which secured Russia's first victory: That of the mind. From Niamey, where protesters called for welcoming the Russians after the military coup, to Kinshasa, where the streets are adorned with the country's flags, the continent has never seemed so pro-Russian and anti-French.Since the first Russia-Africa summit in Sochi in 2019, Prigozhin has set up a sophisticated propaganda machine to try and restore his country's diplomatic influence, lost a quarter of a century ago with the collapse of the USSR. Its objective was to promote the ""dissemination of information about Russian and Soviet support to African countries in their struggle for independence"" and the ""formation of negative attitudes towards European powers and the United States,"" as stated in the aforementioned internal document.The Wagner Group has applied this tactic, to varying degrees, in all the countries where it has sold its services. In the Central African Republic and Mali, for instance, Russian propaganda took root in the fertile ground, characterized by a strong Pan-African sentiment and a rejection of the West.Weaving a disinformation network with the help of companies like Africa Politology (sanctioned by the US Treasury in January), Wagner relied on Russian influencers to disseminate its ideas, and then on African political players, taking advantage of precarious political situations, such as coups d'état and elections.

Video investigation: How a French company is supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine,   ,"""A huge thank you to schoolchildren in Samara. The donations that you collected for us have reached us."" The man addressing the camera, in late December 2022, is a soldier of the ""Donetsk People's Republic,"" affiliated with the Russian army.

How 'Le Monde' recreated De Gaulle's lost 1940 call for France to resist,   ,"On June 18, 1940, Charles de Gaulle gave one of the greatest speeches in French history. From a BBC studio in London, the general called for the French to resist Nazi occupation: ""Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not and will not be extinguished!"" However, no film or recording exists of it.What did General de Gaulle's appeal sound like? What did the French men and women who heard it that day actually hear?With the help of historians and researchers in ethics, Le Monde tried to get as close as possible to what this speech could have been thanks to historical documentation, a tailor-made interpretation by French actor and director François Morel and new technologies of vocal synthesis, assisted by artificial intelligence.A collaboration between Le Monde, l'Institut de recherche et coordination acoustique/musique (the Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music, Ircam) and the technology company Ircam Amplify.Synthesized voices: Ircam Amplify/Sound Analysis and Synthesis Team - STMS Laboratory (IRCAM, CNRS, Sorbonne University, ministry of culture).

Cameroon: How loggers skirt government control,"    'Cameroon's law of the jungle' (1/3). Over the course of a year, Le Monde and InfoCongo met dozens of people involved in the timber trade. Interviews and official documents reveal the authorities' inability to curb the unregulated exploitation of lumber. ","It was 2:25 am in Yaoundé. Two trucks loaded with logs sped along a tarmac road in the Emana district. Dozens do this every night, going from the forested regions in the south, east, or center of the country, and crossing Cameroon's capital. The timber loads all look the same, except for one detail. Some logs are marked, whereas others aren't, like the two trucks seen in the early hours in Emana.While transporting timber at night in built-up areas is permitted in Cameroon, moving ""logs without the regulatory markings outlined in the specifications"" is prohibited. The prohibition does not prevent the many trucks loaded with unmarked timber from passing through the checkpoints manned by police forces, customs officers, and forestry ministry agents. And there's a reason: ""Every official knows you're coming,"" according to Derek,* a logging truck driver who says the officials are warned of their arrival and let them through.Since 2008, the man in his 40s has traveled hundreds of kilometers every week for deliveries to sawmills in Vietnam and China, and to the ports of Douala and Kribi. Derek is no stranger to transporting illegal timber, nicknamed warap in the trade. Cargoes are made up of wood that is authorized for export but cut without permission. These are logs harvested without respecting trunk diameter – which indicates the tree's growth rate – or species that are prohibited from being cut or exported.Over the course of a year, Le Monde and InfoCongo met dozens of timber traffickers, local residents, and illegal log drivers in Cameroon. Their testimonies, along with official documents from the Ministry of Forests and Wildlife (which declined to answer our questions), show that illegal logging is gaining momentum.According to Derek and his colleague Raoul,* whom we met in November 2022 in Yaoundé, the people behind the schemes are often influential figures. They may be businessmen, army or government officials, or members of parliament, who pay or use their authority to operate under the radar. A few days before we met, Derek was delivering timber cut illegally in the central forests to a sawmill run by Vietnamese in the Ahala district of Yaoundé. ""It was for a colonel,"" he said.Derek, who is the father of a large family, knows these details because he's learned to take precautions after working in the industry. For example, the ""colonel"" held a ""video call from his office to reassure [him]."" ""Here's my contact, if you have any problems, I'll sort it out,"" he allegedly promised. The customer ""manages everything, pays, takes down the registrations and sends them by WhatsApp"" to the checkpoints, added Raoul. According to the drivers, most of their deliveries are made to Vietnamese sawmills, which launder them for export via the ports of Douala and Kribi.",Investigations,yaound two trucks loaded logs sped along tarmac road emana district dozens every night going forested regions south east center country crossing cameroons capital timber loads look except one detail logs marked whereas others arent like two trucks seen early hours emana transporting timber night built areas permitted cameroon moving logs without regulatory markings outlined specifications prohibited prohibition prevent many trucks loaded unmarked timber passing checkpoints manned police forces customs officers forestry ministry agents theres reason every official knows youre coming according derek logging truck driver says officials warned arrival let since man traveled hundreds kilometers every week deliveries sawmills vietnam china ports douala kribi derek stranger transporting illegal timber nicknamed warap trade cargoes made wood authorized export cut without permission logs harvested without respecting trunk diameter indicates trees growth rate species prohibited cut exported course year monde infocongo met dozens timber traffickers local residents illegal log drivers cameroon testimonies along official documents ministry forests wildlife declined answer questions show illegal logging gaining momentum according derek colleague raoul met november yaound people behind schemes often influential figures may businessmen army government officials members parliament pay use authority operate radar days met derek delivering timber cut illegally central forests sawmill run vietnamese ahala district yaound colonel said derek father large family knows details hes learned take precautions working industry example colonel held video call office reassure heres contact problems ill sort allegedly promised customer manages everything pays takes registrations sends whatsapp checkpoints added raoul according drivers deliveries made vietnamese sawmills launder export via ports douala kribi,yaound two truck load log sped along tarmac road emana district dozen everi night go forest region south east center countri cross cameroon capit timber load look except one detail log mark wherea other arent like two truck seen earli hour emana transport timber night built area permit cameroon move log without regulatori mark outlin specif prohibit prohibit prevent mani truck load unmark timber pass checkpoint man polic forc custom offic forestri ministri agent there reason everi offici know your come accord derek log truck driver say offici warn arriv let sinc man travel hundr kilomet everi week deliveri sawmil vietnam china port douala kribi derek stranger transport illeg timber nicknam warap trade cargo made wood author export cut without permiss log harvest without respect trunk diamet indic tree growth rate speci prohibit cut export cours year mond infocongo met dozen timber traffick local resid illeg log driver cameroon testimoni along offici document ministri forest wildlif declin answer question show illeg log gain momentum accord derek colleagu raoul met novemb yaound peopl behind scheme often influenti figur may businessmen armi govern offici member parliament pay use author oper radar day met derek deliv timber cut illeg central forest sawmil run vietnames ahala district yaound colonel said derek father larg famili know detail he learn take precaut work industri exampl colonel held video call offic reassur here contact problem ill sort allegedli promis custom manag everyth pay take registr send whatsapp checkpoint ad raoul accord driver deliveri made vietnames sawmil launder export via port douala kribi

"In Iran, five months of revolt filmed by the people",Investigation,"We know what the spark was. One dead body too many, and the Islamic Republic was shaken in the face of a popular revolt that suddenly threatened to turn into a revolution and ignited all corners of the country, even in the basements of the University of Tehran. During these weeks and now months of tumult, videos provide first-hand accounts. Although this filmed record has so much meaning for those who courageously ensure its distribution, the footage is sometimes relatively unclear when taken out of context.Outside the country, two Iranian experts, Farzad Seifikaran and Payam Elhami, have undertaken the task of putting together the scattered pieces of this patchwork of a movement. Seifikaran is an investigative journalist, and Elhami is a data specialist. Together, they work hard to go through social media, in search of all the video material in circulation. They store them, sift through them, determine their origin and cross-reference their content with others to geolocate them. They are not cinematic masterpieces and their quality reflects the immediacy and danger. Their strength lies in the imperative need of their anonymous creators to show what is happening. A collective effort was needed to grasp the meaning and the scope of this major collection.In the vast scene that emerges, it is not just a question of violence and repression. The shots are also those of celebrations, of moments of collective liberation. Men and women dance in the streets around a fire. How can you not be gripped when protesters start singing ""Bella Ciao"" at a funeral? How can you not understand the message, with its universal nature, its references that extend beyond Iran, and tell of the great song of freedom that spans time and continents?Le Monde has decided to take part in a project whose objective is to keep open a window into a movement in danger of obliteration. We are publishing the videos with verification and context so that a wide audience can grasp the momentum, the insights and the revealing moments. This work does not claim to give an exhaustive account of the situation. How can it? Independent media that could operate undisturbed in Iran or go to the country with no hindrances would make this platform, which by definition does not contain a plurality of viewpoints, obsolete. This project is intended to share a piece of history that is also a form of resistance to the fear of seeing the current movement discredited by the authorities.Mahsa Amini was only 22 years old when she died. She lived in Saqqez, a Kurdish town in northwestern Iran, and had traveled to Tehran with her family to visit the capital. On September 13, 2022, she was arrested by the morality police. At the time of her detention, her brother begged the police not to take her away. ""We don't know anyone here,"" he told them. The young woman fell into a coma while in police custody, presumably due to blows to the head. Her hospitalization was made public by Iranian journalists including Niloufar Hamedi, who, working for the Iranian newspaper Shargh, published a photo of the girl's parents embracing in the empty corridor of Kasra Hospital in northern Tehran.",Videos,know spark one dead body many islamic republic shaken face popular revolt suddenly threatened turn revolution ignited corners country even basements university tehran weeks months tumult videos provide first hand accounts although filmed record much meaning courageously ensure distribution footage sometimes relatively unclear taken context outside country two iranian experts farzad seifikaran payam elhami undertaken task putting together scattered pieces patchwork movement seifikaran investigative journalist elhami data specialist together work hard social media search video material circulation store sift determine origin cross reference content others geolocate cinematic masterpieces quality reflects immediacy danger strength lies imperative need anonymous creators show happening collective effort needed grasp meaning scope major collection vast scene emerges question violence repression shots also celebrations moments collective liberation men women dance streets around fire gripped protesters start singing bella ciao funeral understand message universal nature references extend beyond iran tell great song freedom spans time continents monde decided take part project whose objective keep open window movement danger obliteration publishing videos verification context wide audience grasp momentum insights revealing moments work claim give exhaustive account situation independent media could operate undisturbed iran country hindrances would make platform definition contain plurality viewpoints obsolete project intended share piece history also form resistance fear seeing current movement discredited authorities mahsa amini years old died lived saqqez kurdish town northwestern iran traveled tehran family visit capital september arrested morality police time detention brother begged police take away dont know anyone told young woman fell coma police custody presumably due blows head hospitalization made public iranian journalists including niloufar hamedi working iranian newspaper shargh published photo girls parents embracing empty corridor kasra hospital northern tehran,know spark one dead bodi mani islam republ shaken face popular revolt suddenli threaten turn revolut ignit corner countri even basement univers tehran week month tumult video provid first hand account although film record much mean courag ensur distribut footag sometim rel unclear taken context outsid countri two iranian expert farzad seifikaran payam elhami undertaken task put togeth scatter piec patchwork movement seifikaran investig journalist elhami data specialist togeth work hard social media search video materi circul store sift determin origin cross refer content other geoloc cinemat masterpiec qualiti reflect immediaci danger strength lie imper need anonym creator show happen collect effort need grasp mean scope major collect vast scene emerg question violenc repress shot also celebr moment collect liber men women danc street around fire grip protest start sing bella ciao funer understand messag univers natur refer extend beyond iran tell great song freedom span time contin mond decid take part project whose object keep open window movement danger obliter publish video verif context wide audienc grasp momentum insight reveal moment work claim give exhaust account situat independ media could oper undisturb iran countri hindranc would make platform definit contain plural viewpoint obsolet project intend share piec histori also form resist fear see current movement discredit author mahsa amini year old die live saqqez kurdish town northwestern iran travel tehran famili visit capit septemb arrest moral polic time detent brother beg polic take away dont know anyon told young woman fell coma polic custodi presum due blow head hospit made public iranian journalist includ niloufar hamedi work iranian newspap shargh publish photo girl parent embrac empti corridor kasra hospit northern tehran

The first thing you notice about him is that, at 7'2"", he is very tall. But, he's also particularly agile, fast, and skillful. A rare mix in basketball where, contrary to widespread belief, taller players are not necessarily the best.Certainly, their size allows them to take advantage of certain situations around the basket. But they are also often considered less agile, slower, and more fragile.

Roman Abramovich's life as a gentleman in Londongrad,Investigation,"For once, the money and the connections did not suffice. At the beginning of March 2022, Roman Abramovich announced that Chelsea Football Club was up for sale. For the Russian billionaire, it was heartbreaking. Since he bought the London club in 2003, it has won 21 trophies, including five Premier League titles and two Champions Leagues. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 brought his special relationship with Vladimir Putin back into the media spotlight. Abramovich was sanctioned by the British parliament, and his club was seized. On March 5, during a match against Burnley, Chelsea supporters interrupted a minute of applause in support of Ukraine. They chanted the owner's name, over and over again. The Blues' coach, Thomas Tuchel, admonished them about their lack of solidarity with the country invaded by Russia, to no avail. For months on end, the fans showed their loyalty to the oligarch, even during the negotiations with an American investment fund, which ultimately bought the club for €5.2 billion.At Chelsea's helm, Abramovich formed what supporters called the Roman Empire. On May 22, 2022, for the final match of the season at Stamford Bridge, their stadium, they prepared a banner to be unfurled at the end of the match. According to David Johnstone, who has supported the Blues since the 1970s, the club then ""begged"" them to abandon the project, in order to avoid causing the failure of the sale to a group of investors led by the American Todd Bohely. Reluctantly, the fans put away the banner. On a midnight-blue background, with the oligarch's face drawn in white, it read: ""Thank you, Mr. Abramovich. Thanks to you, we've won everything.""In the early 2000s, the football enthusiast, who had attended the 1998 World Cup in France, asked the UBS bank to identify the best football opportunities throughout Europe. ""We were interested in Germany, Italy and France, in particular OGC Nice,"" said Henry, one of his long-standing associates (whose name was changed, at his request). There was nothing for sale. In England, the oil magnate had his eye on Manchester United, impressed by their victorious return match against Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals in 2003. But without success. Then there was Chelsea, the upmarket West London team on the verge of bankruptcy. In July 2003, after rapid negotiations, Abramovich paid £140 million (around €200 million at the time) to purchase the club.Was it only the love of football that motivated such an investment? In her book Les Hommes de Poutine (""Putin's Men"", 2022), the journalist Catherine Belton suggests that the club was bought at Vladimir Putin's request, something that Abramovich has always categorically denied – he even took the author to court over the matter. Another theory is that, by settling in London, the businessman felt better protected from Putin, who has been making and breaking Russian fortunes since he took power in 1999. Abramovich's personal accounts were very healthy: In 2005, he sold his oil flagship, Sibneft, to the state-owned conglomerate Gazprom for almost €11 billion – 130 times the sum he had paid for it in 1995.",Investigations,money connections suffice beginning march roman abramovich announced chelsea football club sale russian billionaire heartbreaking since bought london club trophies including five premier league titles two champions leagues russias invasion ukraine february brought special relationship vladimir putin back media spotlight abramovich sanctioned british parliament club seized march match burnley chelsea supporters interrupted minute applause support ukraine chanted owners name blues coach thomas tuchel admonished lack solidarity country invaded russia avail months end fans showed loyalty oligarch even negotiations american investment fund ultimately bought club billion chelseas helm abramovich formed supporters called roman empire may final match season stamford bridge stadium prepared banner unfurled end match according david johnstone supported blues since club begged abandon project order avoid causing failure sale group investors led american todd bohely reluctantly fans put away banner midnight blue background oligarchs face drawn white read thank abramovich thanks weve everything early football enthusiast attended world cup france asked ubs bank identify best football opportunities throughout europe interested germany italy france particular ogc nice said henry one long standing associates whose name changed request nothing sale england oil magnate eye manchester united impressed victorious return match real madrid champions league quarter finals without success chelsea upmarket west london team verge bankruptcy july rapid negotiations abramovich paid million around million time purchase club love football motivated investment book les hommes poutine putins men journalist catherine belton suggests club bought vladimir putins request something abramovich always categorically denied even took author court matter another theory settling london businessman felt better protected putin making breaking russian fortunes since took power abramovichs personal accounts healthy sold oil flagship sibneft state owned conglomerate gazprom almost billion times sum paid,money connect suffic begin march roman abramovich announc chelsea footbal club sale russian billionair heartbreak sinc bought london club trophi includ five premier leagu titl two champion leagu russia invas ukrain februari brought special relationship vladimir putin back media spotlight abramovich sanction british parliament club seiz march match burnley chelsea support interrupt minut applaus support ukrain chant owner name blue coach thoma tuchel admonish lack solidar countri invad russia avail month end fan show loyalti oligarch even negoti american invest fund ultim bought club billion chelsea helm abramovich form support call roman empir may final match season stamford bridg stadium prepar banner unfurl end match accord david johnston support blue sinc club beg abandon project order avoid caus failur sale group investor led american todd bohe reluctantli fan put away banner midnight blue background oligarch face drawn white read thank abramovich thank weve everyth earli footbal enthusiast attend world cup franc ask ub bank identifi best footbal opportun throughout europ interest germani itali franc particular ogc nice said henri one long stand associ whose name chang request noth sale england oil magnat eye manchest unit impress victori return match real madrid champion leagu quarter final without success chelsea upmarket west london team verg bankruptci juli rapid negoti abramovich paid million around million time purchas club love footbal motiv invest book le homm poutin putin men journalist catherin belton suggest club bought vladimir putin request someth abramovich alway categor deni even took author court matter anoth theori settl london businessman felt better protect putin make break russian fortun sinc took power abramovich person account healthi sold oil flagship sibneft state own conglomer gazprom almost billion time sum paid
Video: Will pulling CO2 from the air really save the climate?,Investigation,"The concept is simple: Suck air into a machine, extract the CO2, and release the clean air back into the atmosphere.According to one of the executives of the American oil company Oxy, this technique for removing carbon dioxide is also revolutionary: ""Direct atmospheric capture (DAC) is a Swiss Army knife – it can solve basically anything climate-related issue."" Seduced, European aeronautics giant Airbus has already purchased from Oxy the equivalent of 400,000 tons of CO2 to be removed from the atmosphere to offset its own greenhouse emissions.Le Monde, with the help of the climate investigation organization Aria, investigated the reality of Oxy's climate ambitions, and the true role that direct air capture can play in the energy transition.If it is to play a role, it remains a minor one and is of real interest only alongside a genuine green transition by oil giants like Oxy.

What happened?Dozens of hours of video footage captured that day and testimonies collected by Le Monde's video investigation unit show that the demonstrator, on the front line of the clashes, was probably hit by an illegal tear gas grenade shot from one of the areas where the gendarmes were positioned. The analyzed footage also proves that Serge Duteuil-Graziani was not hit at that moment by projectiles shot by other demonstrators.Le Monde's investigation also reveals, thanks to unpublished images by Brut journalist Camille Courcy, another illegal shot toward another demonstrator:  A shot made too horizontally and carried out with the most powerful propulsion device, which hit this demonstrator in the head.",Videos,thousands grenades molotov cocktails hundreds injured march sainte soline western france demonstration mega basin large water reserve turned clash police protesters least two demonstrators including serge duteuil graziani year old activist seriously injured happened dozens hours video footage captured day testimonies collected mondes video investigation unit show demonstrator front line clashes probably hit illegal tear gas grenade shot one areas gendarmes positioned analyzed footage also proves serge duteuil graziani hit moment projectiles shot demonstrators mondes investigation also reveals thanks unpublished images brut journalist camille courcy another illegal shot toward another demonstrator shot made horizontally carried powerful propulsion device hit demonstrator head,thousand grenad molotov cocktail hundr injur march saint solin western franc demonstr mega basin larg water reserv turn clash polic protest least two demonstr includ serg duteuil graziani year old activist serious injur happen dozen hour video footag captur day testimoni collect mond video investig unit show demonstr front line clash probabl hit illeg tear ga grenad shot one area gendarm posit analyz footag also prove serg duteuil graziani hit moment projectil shot demonstr mond investig also reveal thank unpublish imag brut journalist camil courci anoth illeg shot toward anoth demonstr shot made horizont carri power propuls devic hit demonstr head
How Roman Abramovich got hold of the USSR's oil,Investigation,"Everything had been thought through, and the risk factors carefully weighed. In the mid-1980s, Roman Abramovich was doing his military service in an artillery unit in Kirzhach, some 100 kilometers east of Moscow. But his salary of seven rubles a month was not enough. The Red Army conscript was 20 years old and wanted more.In one of the few photos of him at the time, he is seen posing in uniform, his chapka slightly askew, a shy, enigmatic smile on his lips. It was at the time of perestroika, the ""restructuration"" program that allowed the Soviet Union to start tasting capitalism.To get his piece of the pie, Abramovich hatched a plan that was as inventive as it was lucrative. He persuaded several drivers of military vehicles to regularly siphon off a few liters of petrol from their tanks. ""He didn't even do it himself,” his friend Nikolai Panteleimonov told the Russian tabloid Zhizn in 2007. ""He had recruited a small team who usually operated at night.""In addition to a share in the profits, Roma, as his comrades called him, incentivized his accomplices by offering them ice cream and pastries. The cans were left in a forest outside the base, and then collected by a second group of soldiers, who sold them to the company's officers at half the market price. No one denounced the scheme: From one end of the chain to the other, everyone profited, especially the young entrepreneur, who pocketed a healthy share of the profits. Panteleimonov summed up his friend's talent, in Zhizn in 2007: ""Roman Abramovich could make money from nothing.""Unlike most oligarchs, who became rich through the privatization of state enterprises after the fall of the USSR, the future billionaire did not grow up among the dignitaries of the Soviet regime. His family history, which he has hardly ever mentioned in public, spans the darkest pages of the 20th century: the Holocaust and the Gulag.At the outbreak of the Second World War, his mother, Irina Mikhailenko, had to flee her native Kyiv, in Ukraine, just before the Nazi invasion. Some of her relatives, determined to stay put, were among the 33,771 Jews murdered on September 29 and 30, 1941 by the Einsatzgruppen at the edge of the Babi Yar ravine. At the same time, the family of Roman's father, Arkadiy Abramovich, was forced to leave Lithuania because they were Jewish and labeled ""capitalists"" – Arkadiy's father, Nachman, was a prosperous merchant. The Abramovichs were soon dispatched to various labor camps in Siberia. Nachman died there in 1942. His wife and sons, including the young Arkadiy, remained in detention for over a decade until the mid-1950s.",Investigations,everything thought risk factors carefully weighed mid roman abramovich military service artillery unit kirzhach kilometers east moscow salary seven rubles month enough red army conscript years old wanted one photos time seen posing uniform chapka slightly askew shy enigmatic smile lips time perestroika restructuration program allowed soviet union start tasting capitalism get piece pie abramovich hatched plan inventive lucrative persuaded several drivers military vehicles regularly siphon liters petrol tanks didnt even friend nikolai panteleimonov told russian tabloid zhizn recruited small team usually operated night addition share profits roma comrades called incentivized accomplices offering ice cream pastries cans left forest outside base collected second group soldiers sold companys officers half market price one denounced scheme one end chain everyone profited especially young entrepreneur pocketed healthy share profits panteleimonov summed friends talent zhizn roman abramovich could make money nothing unlike oligarchs became rich privatization state enterprises fall ussr future billionaire grow among dignitaries soviet regime family history hardly ever mentioned public spans darkest pages century holocaust gulag outbreak second world war mother irina mikhailenko flee native kyiv ukraine nazi invasion relatives determined stay put among jews murdered september einsatzgruppen edge babi yar ravine time family romans father arkadiy abramovich forced leave lithuania jewish labeled capitalists arkadiys father nachman prosperous merchant abramovichs soon dispatched various labor camps siberia nachman died wife sons including young arkadiy remained detention decade mid,everyth thought risk factor care weigh mid roman abramovich militari servic artilleri unit kirzhach kilomet east moscow salari seven rubl month enough red armi conscript year old want one photo time seen pose uniform chapka slightli askew shi enigmat smile lip time perestroika restructur program allow soviet union start tast capit get piec pie abramovich hatch plan invent lucr persuad sever driver militari vehicl regularli siphon liter petrol tank didnt even friend nikolai panteleimonov told russian tabloid zhizn recruit small team usual oper night addit share profit roma comrad call incentiv accomplic offer ice cream pastri can left forest outsid base collect second group soldier sold compani offic half market price one denounc scheme one end chain everyon profit especi young entrepreneur pocket healthi share profit panteleimonov sum friend talent zhizn roman abramovich could make money noth unlik oligarch becam rich privat state enterpris fall ussr futur billionair grow among dignitari soviet regim famili histori hardli ever mention public span darkest page centuri holocaust gulag outbreak second world war mother irina mikhailenko flee nativ kyiv ukrain nazi invas rel determin stay put among jew murder septemb einsatzgruppen edg babi yar ravin time famili roman father arkadiy abramovich forc leav lithuania jewish label capitalist arkadiy father nachman prosper merchant abramovich soon dispatch variou labor camp siberia nachman die wife son includ young arkadiy remain detent decad mid
China and Taiwan: Is a conflict inevitable?,   ,"Since the end of the Chinese civil war and the nationalists' retreat to Taiwan in 1949, it has been the Chinese Communist Party's historic mission to merge the island into its territory, in the name of its ""One-China"" policy.While Chinese President Xi Jinping has stated that he will achieve this peacefully, he does not rule out the use of force. This threat became dangerously clear when the Chinese army engaged in large-scale military drills around the island, as it did in early April 2023 and in August 2022. Both times, a third actor was involved in the escalation of tensions: the United States, as the close ties between Taipei and Washington irritate Beijing. At the heart of these tensions lies the question of a potential American intervention in the event of a Chinese invasion.In this episode of our ""World Maps"" video series, Le Monde's video team examines the reasons behind the tensions between China and Taiwan, as well as the possibilities and implications of a conflict, if one were to occur.

To do so, it must be fired at a certain angle, as specified by its manufacturer, the French company Alsetex.Le Monde consulted internal documents from the national police and gendarmerie, analyzed images of 331 shots fired by police officers and gendarmes, and produced a 3D model of the behavior of a Cougar grenade launcher shot.

Shipwreck off the Greek coast: Tracing the rescue services' failures,Investigation,"Behind bars in the ultra-secure Malakasa camp north of Athens, the 104 survivors of the shipwreck off of Greece's Peloponnese peninsula on the night of June 13 are said to have been ordered not to talk about the circumstances of the disaster. According to several of them, the Greek authorities cited the ""secrecy"" of the procedure, despite the fact that an investigation by the country's Supreme Civil and Criminal Court was ordered the day after the tragedy, which claimed the lives of hundreds of people who had sailed from Libya to reach Italy.For several days, however, questions have been mounting about the slowness of the Greek Coast Guard's intervention and what caused the capsizing of the trawler, whose name remains unknown to this day.Contacted by telephone, Hassan, a Syrian survivor who wished to remain anonymous, recounted a ""journey from hell."" ""When I got on the boat in Libya, I didn't know there would be so many of us. On the deck, where I was, there were around 200 of us. We were on top of each other and, after a few days, we ran out of food and water."" Two men died of thirst during the crossing, according to him.The young man remembers two commercial boats approaching them: ""The first gave us packs of water. We asked the second crew for help, but they left pretty quickly, telling us they couldn't help us, we'd have to wait for the Coast Guard."" The blue trawler aboard which the migrants were sailing was having engine problems. ""At one point, we couldn't go any further and we wanted the Coast Guard − Greek or Italian, it didn't matter − to come and rescue us,"" he said.When the Greek Coast Guard approached the ship, ropes were twice thrown toward their boat to pull them along, according to Hassan and other survivors' accounts leaked to several Greek media outlets. The first time, the rope snapped. The second time, ""the boat rolled from left to right, then sank as a result of their interference,"" insisted Hassan, who swam for almost two hours before being taken to safety on a Greek Coast Guard speedboat. ""I don't know if they wanted to push us back to Italy or take us to Greece, but given their attitude, I didn't get the impression they wanted to save us,"" he said.In one of the accounts published in the center-right Greek daily I Kathimerini, a 23-year-old Syrian echoes Hassan's experience: ""The second time the Coast Guard attached the cable, we initially felt like we were being pulled. Then our boat tilted. The Greek ship picked up speed, and we shouted 'stop' in English (...), but they didn't understand us.""

Chances are the answer is yes, because these melodies still resonate in our heads today. These soundtracks, which are almost universally famous, share one thing in common: they were all composed by John Williams, who is also the man behind the music for E.T., Jaws, and Superman. He has even become the living artist with the most Oscar nominations − 53 in total.His style has seduced some of Hollywood's most popular directors. Georges Lucas asked him to create the soundtrack for Star Wars, and Steven Spielberg (Indiana Jones, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Catch Me If You Can) entrusted him with the task of scoring all his films, with the exception of The Color Purple.What's the secret sauce behind Williams' popularity?

Faced with this worrying surge in the number of fires and a shortage of firefighters, many regions are having to rethink their approach.In southwestern France's Gironde region, a department accustomed to the risk of wildfire, 32,000 hectares burned last year. The severity of the fires can be blamed on their intensity, having broken out simultaneously, and a precautionary culture that has diminished among farmers and the general public. The situation is all the more worrying in that, with climate change, the risk increases as the years go by.In Gironde, as well as in regions where the risk of fire has long been infrequent, the 2022 wildfires raised awareness.

Why are the journalists of France's only Sunday paper on strike?,    Journalists at France's 'Journal du Dimanche' have been on strike for over a month.

For the strikers at the JDD, the appointment of Geoffroy Lejeune, former editorial director of the far-right magazine Valeurs Actuelles, as head of the newspaper is not going down well. The 34-year-old is close to Marion Maréchal, Marine Le Pen's niece, and publicly supported far-right candidate Eric Zemmour in the 2022 presidential election.

Why is France so concerned about the coup in Niger?,"    Since Niger's coup leaders toppled President Mohamed Bazoum on July 26, France has taken a firm stance against the putschists, without getting directly involved in the crisis. ","What's the reason behind France's vocal opposition to Niger's coup leaders? On Wednesday, July 26, President Mohamed Bazoum was overthrown by General Abdourahamane Tchiani, the former head of the presidential guard. Since then, France has actively called for Bazoum to be released and reinstated. And while the country is not intervening directly in the crisis, it supports a possible armed intervention by ECOWAS, the West African regional bloc, against the coup leaders, who take an anti-French position. On August 25, the military rulers gave the French ambassador Sylvain Itté 48 hours to leave the country. Paris rejected the ultimatum, saying that it didn't recognize the junta's authority.Why is France acting in this way, when other countries, such as the United States, have adopted a more flexible line? France is the foreign country with the largest number of soldiers (around 1,500) in Niger, some of whom have left Mali and Burkina Faso in recent years.

US Fed votes to maintain high interest rates,"    The US Federal Reserve kept interest rates at a 22-year high for a second straight meeting, noting that 'economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter.' ","The US Federal Reserve voted on Wednesday, November 1, to hold interest rates at a 22-year high for a second consecutive meeting, as it moves to slow stubborn inflation without damaging the strong economy.The Fed's decision to keep its benchmark lending rate between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent gives policymakers time to ""assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy,"" the central bank said in a statement. The decision was widely expected, given the Fed's stated goal of slowing inflation to its long-term target of two percent.It marks the first time officials have held rates steady at two consecutive meetings since they began tightening monetary policy last year. The US central bank said any future decisions on policy firming would ""take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."" Since peaking at more than seven percent in June last year, inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored yardstick, has slowed by more than half – although it remains stuck firmly above three percent.When the Fed hikes interest rates it raises the cost of borrowing from the bank, which is supposed to dampen economic activity and weaken the labor market. But despite its aggressive monetary tightening, the Fed noted that ""economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter."" Job gains remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low, it added.The Fed's move is likely to raise expectations that it is done hiking interest rates and is moving into a prolonged pause.",Economy,federal reserve voted wednesday november hold interest rates year high second consecutive meeting moves slow stubborn inflation without damaging strong economy feds decision keep benchmark lending rate percent percent gives policymakers time assess additional information implications monetary policy central bank said statement decision widely expected given feds stated goal slowing inflation long term target two percent marks first time officials held rates steady two consecutive meetings since began tightening monetary policy last year central bank said future decisions policy firming would take account cumulative tightening monetary policy lags monetary policy affects economic activity inflation economic financial developments since peaking seven percent june last year inflation measured feds favored yardstick slowed half although remains stuck firmly three percent fed hikes interest rates raises cost borrowing bank supposed dampen economic activity weaken labor market despite aggressive monetary tightening fed noted economic activity expanded strong pace third quarter job gains remain strong unemployment rate remained low added feds move likely raise expectations done hiking interest rates moving prolonged pause,feder reserv vote wednesday novemb hold interest rate year high second consecut meet move slow stubborn inflat without damag strong economi fed decis keep benchmark lend rate percent percent give policymak time assess addit inform implic monetari polici central bank said statement decis wide expect given fed state goal slow inflat long term target two percent mark first time offici held rate steadi two consecut meet sinc began tighten monetari polici last year central bank said futur decis polici firm would take account cumul tighten monetari polici lag monetari polici affect econom activ inflat econom financi develop sinc peak seven percent june last year inflat measur fed favor yardstick slow half although remain stuck firmli three percent fed hike interest rate rais cost borrow bank suppos dampen econom activ weaken labor market despit aggress monetari tighten fed note econom activ expand strong pace third quarter job gain remain strong unemploy rate remain low ad fed move like rais expect done hike interest rate move prolong paus
"US sanctions UAE, Turkish, and Chinese entities aiding Russian 'war machine'","    The US Treasury, State and Commerce Department sanctions target hundreds of 'willing third-country individuals and entities' that Russia uses 'to resupply its military'. ","The United States announced sanctions Thursday, November 2, on individuals and companies it accused of abetting Russia's war against Ukraine, targeting entities in Turkey, China and the United Arab Emirates in a bid to disrupt Moscow's supply chains. This comes as Russia has offshored the production of technology, equipment and other goods it needs for its military, relying on suppliers in other countries to acquire these items, said the US Treasury Department.""Russia is dependent on willing third-country individuals and entities to resupply its military and perpetuate its heinous war against Ukraine and we will not hesitate in holding them accountable,"" said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a statement. Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine in February 2022, sparking the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II.The Treasury added on Thursday that Russia has been exploiting ""otherwise legitimate economic relationships"" with other countries. It said entities in China, Turkey and the UAE have been sending Russia dual-use goods such as critical components that Moscow relies on for its weapons systems.The latest sanctions involve 130 new targets. Among them is Turkish national Berk Turken for his role in a procurement network with ties to Russian intelligence services, alongside a UAE-based network for alleged involvement in Russian illicit finance, the department said. The sanctions also take aim at Russia's domestic industrial base, arguing Moscow has reoriented it ""to ensure that the war machine can sustain itself."" Another area is the financial services sector, with sanctions introduced on seven Russia-based banks.Apart from the Treasury, the US State Department is also issuing nearly 100 sanctions targeting areas like Russia's future energy production and revenue, metals and mining sector as well as defense procurement. All property and interests in property of sanctioned parties in the US are blocked and must be reported to US authorities, with restrictions on transactions involving sanctioned people as well.In a separate statement on Thursday, the Commerce Department said it blacklisted 13 entities for supporting Russia's military through the procurement, development and proliferation of Russian drones. Among the entities, 12 are in Russia and one in Uzbekistan. The rule effectively cuts them off from legally accessing items subject to US jurisdiction, said the Commerce Department.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the US for introducing the new sanctions in an evening address.

'Is the US actually flirting with insolvency?',"The size of the US federal debt is more a sign of the robustness of the economy than proof of its weakness, write Paul Simko and Richard Smith, two financial experts.","At a level of over $31 trillion at the end of 2022, there is no doubt that the United States federal debt is very large. For perspective, the US federal debt currently exceeds the combined GDP of China, Japan, Germany, France, and the UK. Is the US actually flirting with insolvency?According to December 2022 Federal Reserve data, the $31.4 trillion securities are held by the US private sector ($15.6 billion), foreign investors ($7.2 billion), the federal government ($6.8 billion) and US state and local governments ($1.6 billion).Just over one-fifth of all US federal debt is owned by the federal government itself. But that debt is an offsetting asset held at the same federal level. Most notably, the Federal Reserve has debt holdings of $5.1 trillion. It uses these securities, as one monetary tool, among others, to influence US and international macro-economic conditions. On a smaller scale, the US Treasury Department is mandated by law to hold US Social Security funds as US Treasuries.A large portion of the US public sector federal spending is financed through the issuance of treasury notes (voluntary) versus taxation (involuntary), alternative methods employed by the federal government of converting private sector capital to public sector capital. This is a federal financing decision, not a federal spending level decision, though the two are often conflated. Due to the immense size and purchasing power of the US domestic private sector, it holds just shy of half the US debt. The main rationale the domestic sector has for holding these in such large quantities is to manage against riskier investments. And from the US federal government perspective, interest payments to the US domestic sector are typically taxable events, and principal repayments keeps cash within its own borders.US state and local governments have similar reasons for owning US federal debt –diversification and risk management, often due to statutory mandates to minimize investment risk of public sector funds. Notably, at the same time the US government is effectively borrowing from state and local governments through US treasuries, it is providing over $1 trillion annually in grants to these same entities.The foreign holdings of $7.4 trillion, just under one-fourth, are those that garner the most attention. Foreign holders, similar to other investors, desire to hold a portion of their assets in low-risk and highly liquid securities. Given that substantial amounts of international trade is in US dollars, and the dollar is the foremost global reserve currency, US debt is also held by foreign investors to satisfy trade, reserve currency, and exchange rate needs. Foreign-owned debt, on average, is much more costly to the US than that domestically held. Interest paid is not recaptured through taxation, and repayments of both interest and principal represent dollars that will leave the US.",Economy,level trillion end doubt united states federal debt large perspective federal debt currently exceeds combined gdp china japan germany france actually flirting insolvency according december federal reserve data trillion securities held private sector billion foreign investors billion federal government billion state local governments billion one fifth federal debt owned federal government debt offsetting asset held federal level notably federal reserve debt holdings trillion uses securities one monetary tool among others influence international macro economic conditions smaller scale treasury department mandated law hold social security funds treasuries large portion public sector federal spending financed issuance treasury notes voluntary versus taxation involuntary alternative methods employed federal government converting private sector capital public sector capital federal financing decision federal spending level decision though two often conflated due immense size purchasing power domestic private sector holds shy half debt main rationale domestic sector holding large quantities manage riskier investments federal government perspective interest payments domestic sector taxable events principal repayments keeps cash within borders state local governments similar reasons owning federal debt diversification risk management often due statutory mandates minimize investment risk public sector funds notably time government effectively borrowing state local governments treasuries providing trillion annually grants entities foreign holdings trillion one fourth garner attention foreign holders similar investors desire hold portion assets low risk highly liquid securities given substantial amounts international trade dollars dollar foremost global reserve currency debt also held foreign investors satisfy trade reserve currency exchange rate needs foreign owned debt average much costly domestically held interest paid recaptured taxation repayments interest principal represent dollars leave,level trillion end doubt unit state feder debt larg perspect feder debt current exce combin gdp china japan germani franc actual flirt insolv accord decemb feder reserv data trillion secur held privat sector billion foreign investor billion feder govern billion state local govern billion one fifth feder debt own feder govern debt offset asset held feder level notabl feder reserv debt hold trillion use secur one monetari tool among other influenc intern macro econom condit smaller scale treasuri depart mandat law hold social secur fund treasuri larg portion public sector feder spend financ issuanc treasuri note voluntari versu taxat involuntari altern method employ feder govern convert privat sector capit public sector capit feder financ decis feder spend level decis though two often conflat due immens size purchas power domest privat sector hold shi half debt main rational domest sector hold larg quantiti manag riskier invest feder govern perspect interest payment domest sector taxabl event princip repay keep cash within border state local govern similar reason own feder debt diversif risk manag often due statutori mandat minim invest risk public sector fund notabl time govern effect borrow state local govern treasuri provid trillion annual grant entiti foreign hold trillion one fourth garner attent foreign holder similar investor desir hold portion asset low risk highli liquid secur given substanti amount intern trade dollar dollar foremost global reserv currenc debt also held foreign investor satisfi trade reserv currenc exchang rate need foreign own debt averag much costli domest held interest paid recaptur taxat repay interest princip repres dollar leav
"Anne Krueger: 'Inflation in the US may have peaked, but interventions still have plenty of momentum'",The economist criticizes the impact of US President Joe Biden's protectionist measures on rising prices and US competitiveness.,"It is said that if you put a frog in boiling water, it immediately jumps out; but if you put it in cold water and gradually turn up the heat, it does not react – and is eventually boiled to death. Something similar can happen to economies.Both inflation and the ad hoc interventions – sometimes referred to as industrial policy – distort the economy and result in lower economic growth. But inflation triggers a quick response. An economy-wide phenomenon, it gains momentum as one group after another seeks to restore or increase its real returns.At a certain point, people begin to object. From then on, as the rate of inflation rises, pressure on policymakers to reduce it intensifies. Once inflation is subdued, growth can resume.By contrast, the impact of targeted tariffs and industry-specific measures at any point in time, or in any one sector of the economy, is usually relatively small. Though they contribute inflationary pressure, reduce the economy’s flexibility, and weaken growth, they tend to be less noticed than a surge in inflation, so the public is unlikely to reject them.Moreover, the prospect of lowering a tariff or removing a subsidy is typically met with strong resistance by the affected industry. So, whereas curbing inflation is a political imperative, reversing distortionary ad hoc measures is politically difficult.The United States today illustrates this dynamic. US President Joe Biden’s administration has bemoaned inflationary pressures and supported the US Federal Reserve in its efforts to rein in price increases. But it has also sharply increased government expenditure through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and introduced or upheld widespread industry-specific regulations, most of which are inflationary.Inflation may have peaked in the US, but ad hoc interventions still have plenty of momentum. Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports – which Biden did not remove – have resulted in the world’s highest steel costs. This means that production costs are rising in any industry that relies on large amounts of steel – say, automobile manufacturers. Meanwhile, American producers of electric vehicles are receiving subsidies and tax breaks. Some interventions, such as subsidies, can be dangerous, not least because they can suggest favoritism and even outright corruption.The Biden administration is also imposing tariffs on solar-panel imports, despite its concern for the environment. It has created large subsidies and other incentives for investment in semiconductors and batteries. It has capped the price of some prescription drugs, such as insulin, for elderly Medicare patients, with price ceilings set to be imposed on additional drugs each year, and has introduced a requirement for the government to negotiate prices of some drugs – measures that could lead to shortages and impede the development of cheaper generic drugs.",Economy,said put frog boiling water immediately jumps put cold water gradually turn heat react eventually boiled death something similar happen economies inflation hoc interventions sometimes referred industrial policy distort economy result lower economic growth inflation triggers quick response economy wide phenomenon gains momentum one group another seeks restore increase real returns certain point people begin object rate inflation rises pressure policymakers reduce intensifies inflation subdued growth resume contrast impact targeted tariffs industry specific measures point time one sector economy usually relatively small though contribute inflationary pressure reduce economy flexibility weaken growth tend less noticed surge inflation public unlikely reject moreover prospect lowering tariff removing subsidy met strong resistance affected industry whereas curbing inflation political imperative reversing distortionary hoc measures politically difficult united states today illustrates dynamic president joe biden administration bemoaned inflationary pressures supported federal reserve efforts rein price increases also sharply increased government expenditure inflation reduction act ira introduced upheld widespread industry specific regulations inflationary inflation may peaked hoc interventions still plenty momentum donald trump tariffs steel aluminum imports biden remove resulted world highest steel costs means production costs rising industry relies large amounts steel say automobile manufacturers meanwhile american producers electric vehicles receiving subsidies tax breaks interventions subsidies dangerous least suggest favoritism even outright corruption biden administration also imposing tariffs solar panel imports despite concern environment created large subsidies incentives investment semiconductors batteries capped price prescription drugs insulin elderly medicare patients price ceilings set imposed additional drugs year introduced requirement government negotiate prices drugs measures could lead shortages impede development cheaper generic drugs,said put frog boil water immedi jump put cold water gradual turn heat react eventu boil death someth similar happen economi inflat hoc intervent sometim refer industri polici distort economi result lower econom growth inflat trigger quick respons economi wide phenomenon gain momentum one group anoth seek restor increas real return certain point peopl begin object rate inflat rise pressur policymak reduc intensifi inflat subdu growth resum contrast impact target tariff industri specif measur point time one sector economi usual rel small though contribut inflationari pressur reduc economi flexibl weaken growth tend less notic surg inflat public unlik reject moreov prospect lower tariff remov subsidi met strong resist affect industri wherea curb inflat polit imper revers distortionari hoc measur polit difficult unit state today illustr dynam presid joe biden administr bemoan inflationari pressur support feder reserv effort rein price increas also sharpli increas govern expenditur inflat reduct act ira introduc upheld widespread industri specif regul inflationari inflat may peak hoc intervent still plenti momentum donald trump tariff steel aluminum import biden remov result world highest steel cost mean product cost rise industri reli larg amount steel say automobil manufactur meanwhil american produc electr vehicl receiv subsidi tax break intervent subsidi danger least suggest favorit even outright corrupt biden administr also impos tariff solar panel import despit concern environ creat larg subsidi incent invest semiconductor batteri cap price prescript drug insulin elderli medicar patient price ceil set impos addit drug year introduc requir govern negoti price drug measur could lead shortag imped develop cheaper gener drug
United States: The auto strike brings victories for both unionized workers and Southern states,The agreement signed by the three major automakers provides for a 25% pay rise over four years for its workers. It will upset the sector's highly profitable business model on the other side of the Atlantic.,"There's no denying it: Detroit's blue-collar, unionized auto workers are the clear winners of the historic American auto plant strike. Workers at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis will benefit from a wage increase of around 25% over four years, according to the agreements that put an end to the strike. The maximum worker's wage will rise to $42 (€39.50) an hour. An operator will now earn more than $80,000 a year, excluding overtime.The automotive industry is on the verge of returning to its glory days in terms of wages: according to a survey by the Washington Post. With this agreement, the hourly wage, currently $32, will return to the inflation-adjusted level in 1990 – around $42. Back then, auto workers earned 80% more than other private-sector employees.With the bankruptcy of the Detroit automakers in 2009 and the arrival of foreign groups in the non-union South, this gap narrowed to 14% today. It's on the rise again. The embodiment of this success is the progressive Shawn Fain, a former electrician at Chrysler (now part of Stellantis), who was elected head of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union in the spring, and who led a determined strike against the three automakers, the first since the 1930s.The political winner is President Joe Biden, who visited a picket line during the conflict, a first for a US president. The Democrat absolutely needs to win the state of Michigan, where Detroit is located, and which had made Donald Trump's victory in 2016, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.The losers are the Detroit automakers, the Big Three, hit by rising costs as they have to turn the corner on electric vehicles. ""In the past, the UAW always had a realistic respect for the needs of an automobile company to stay competitive. This time, they did not,"" lamented Bob Lutz, former president of Chrysler. Ford put the increase at between $850 and $900 per vehicle. The average selling price of a new vehicle in the USA is $48,000, and there is no model under $20,000.Shareholders are feeling the pinch, even though automaker shares have rebounded slightly with the announcement of the return to work. Wall Street was infatuated with Detroit's revival in January 2021, ready to embark on the battle of the electric vehicle. Since then, Ford's share price has fallen back below $10, from $25 in January 2022. General Motors is at its lowest since 2016, if we exclude the free fall at the start of the Covid-19 crisis, and is worth half what it was a year ago. Ford and General Motors are worth $39 billion and $37 billion respectively, 16 times less than Tesla ($628 billion), whose share price has been halved in two years.",Economy,theres denying detroits blue collar unionized auto workers clear winners historic american auto plant strike workers ford general motors stellantis benefit wage increase around four years according agreements put end strike maximum workers wage rise hour operator earn year excluding overtime automotive industry verge returning glory days terms wages according survey washington post agreement hourly wage currently return inflation adjusted level around back auto workers earned private sector employees bankruptcy detroit automakers arrival foreign groups non union south gap narrowed today rise embodiment success progressive shawn fain former electrician chrysler part stellantis elected head united auto workers uaw union spring led determined strike three automakers first since political winner president joe biden visited line conflict first president democrat absolutely needs win state michigan detroit located made donald trumps victory along pennsylvania wisconsin losers detroit automakers big three hit rising costs turn corner electric vehicles past uaw always realistic respect needs automobile company stay competitive time lamented bob lutz former president chrysler ford put increase per vehicle average selling price new vehicle usa model shareholders feeling pinch even though automaker shares rebounded slightly announcement return work wall street infatuated detroits revival january ready embark battle electric vehicle since fords share price fallen back january general motors lowest since exclude free fall start covid crisis worth half year ago ford general motors worth billion billion respectively times less tesla billion whose share price halved two years,there deni detroit blue collar union auto worker clear winner histor american auto plant strike worker ford gener motor stellanti benefit wage increas around four year accord agreement put end strike maximum worker wage rise hour oper earn year exclud overtim automot industri verg return glori day term wage accord survey washington post agreement hourli wage current return inflat adjust level around back auto worker earn privat sector employe bankruptci detroit automak arriv foreign group non union south gap narrow today rise embodi success progress shawn fain former electrician chrysler part stellanti elect head unit auto worker uaw union spring led determin strike three automak first sinc polit winner presid joe biden visit line conflict first presid democrat absolut need win state michigan detroit locat made donald trump victori along pennsylvania wisconsin loser detroit automak big three hit rise cost turn corner electr vehicl past uaw alway realist respect need automobil compani stay competit time lament bob lutz former presid chrysler ford put increas per vehicl averag sell price new vehicl usa model sharehold feel pinch even though automak share rebound slightli announc return work wall street infatu detroit reviv januari readi embark battl electr vehicl sinc ford share price fallen back januari gener motor lowest sinc exclud free fall start covid crisi worth half year ago ford gener motor worth billion billion respect time less tesla billion whose share price halv two year
Jason Furman: 'The US  is making progress on some of its most stubborn problems',"Although all the indicators for the US economy are green, persistently high inflation could cast a shadow over the end of President Joe Biden's term, warns the former chairman of Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.","A year ago Bloomberg predicted with 100% certainty that the United States would go into recession. The US economy defied this prediction, growing at a 4.9% annual rate in the third quarter (or 1.2% actual rate), a phenomenal showing that is nearly triple what is believed to be the economy's underlying potential growth rate. American consumers led the way, increasing their spending at a 4% annual rate. These are the same American consumers that kept the US economy out of recession over the last year and a half – continuing to spend enough to offset any contractionary effects of the Federal Reserve's policies on the housing sector and other parts of the economy.The labor market is very strong as well. The unemployment rate has been at about a 50-year low, jobs are about 2 million higher than pre-pandemic forecasts and labor force participation rates continue to rise. After wages were failing to keep up with inflation for much of 2021 and 2022, they have risen faster than inflation this year and are beginning to catch up with where they otherwise would have been.The biggest pain point in the economy has been inflation but that has gotten better, or at least less bad. The 12-month inflation rate fell from a peak of 9.1% to 3.7% over the last 12 months, the lowest rate among the G7 economies. Moreover, these 12-month data present an outdated view of the pace of inflation – measured over the last three months the underlying pace of inflation is considerably lower.All of this makes it remarkable how negative households are about the economy. The economic approval rating for President Joe Biden is very low and consumer sentiment is around the same level it was in 2009, at a time when the US was in the depths of recession with a 10% unemployment rate. Perhaps consumers are reacting to non-economic news, like immigration or crime. Perhaps they are concerned about the high level of prices or high mortgage rates. But another possibility is that they are not nearly as pessimistic as they claim to be – after all for some reason they keep spending money.If the economy stays good then I would expect people would eventually realize it and approval of the economy would grow. The problem is that although the path to a soft landing has gotten wider it still will be hard to avoid either the Scylla of recession or the Charybdis of continued inflation. Recession risks may not be especially elevated but there is always a chance and history shows that strong recent growth is no guarantee against a rapid deterioration. Events around the world plus the recent tightening of financial conditions in the United States are all at least some cause for concern. No one expects anything like the recent rapid pace of growth to continue.",Economy,year ago bloomberg predicted certainty united states would recession economy defied prediction growing annual rate third quarter actual rate phenomenal showing nearly triple believed economys underlying potential growth rate american consumers led way increasing spending annual rate american consumers kept economy recession last year half continuing spend enough offset contractionary effects federal reserves policies housing sector parts economy labor market strong well unemployment rate year low jobs million higher pre pandemic forecasts labor force participation rates continue rise wages failing keep inflation much risen faster inflation year beginning catch otherwise would biggest pain point economy inflation gotten better least less bad month inflation rate fell peak last months lowest rate among economies moreover month data present outdated view pace inflation measured last three months underlying pace inflation considerably lower makes remarkable negative households economy economic approval rating president joe biden low consumer sentiment around level time depths recession unemployment rate perhaps consumers reacting non economic news like immigration crime perhaps concerned high level prices high mortgage rates another possibility nearly pessimistic claim reason keep spending money economy stays good would expect people would eventually realize approval economy would grow problem although path soft landing gotten wider still hard avoid either scylla recession charybdis continued inflation recession risks may especially elevated always chance history shows strong recent growth guarantee rapid deterioration events around world plus recent tightening financial conditions united states least cause concern one expects anything like recent rapid pace growth continue,year ago bloomberg predict certainti unit state would recess economi defi predict grow annual rate third quarter actual rate phenomen show nearli tripl believ economi underli potenti growth rate american consum led way increas spend annual rate american consum kept economi recess last year half continu spend enough offset contractionari effect feder reserv polici hous sector part economi labor market strong well unemploy rate year low job million higher pre pandem forecast labor forc particip rate continu rise wage fail keep inflat much risen faster inflat year begin catch otherwis would biggest pain point economi inflat gotten better least less bad month inflat rate fell peak last month lowest rate among economi moreov month data present outdat view pace inflat measur last three month underli pace inflat consider lower make remark neg household economi econom approv rate presid joe biden low consum sentiment around level time depth recess unemploy rate perhap consum react non econom news like immigr crime perhap concern high level price high mortgag rate anoth possibl nearli pessimist claim reason keep spend money economi stay good would expect peopl would eventu realiz approv economi would grow problem although path soft land gotten wider still hard avoid either scylla recess charybdi continu inflat recess risk may especi elev alway chanc histori show strong recent growth guarante rapid deterior event around world plu recent tighten financi condit unit state least caus concern one expect anyth like recent rapid pace growth continu
"Laurence Nardon: 'In line with Trump, Bidenomics reinforces proud American protectionism'","    The political scientist analyzes the successes and limitations of the Democratic administration's reforms, which, although aimed primarily at the middle class by breaking with neoliberalism, are struggling to win them over politically. ","In the aftermath of the 2007-2008 subprime crisis, public anger at growing social inequality in the United States was reflected both on the right, with the reactionary agitation of the Tea Partiers, and on the left, with the student protests of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Taking office in January 2021, two weeks after an unprecedented assault on Capitol Hill by Donald Trump's supporters, Joe Biden set himself the task of giving the American middle class back the means to climb the social ladder, in order to remove any reason for their populist temptations.His administration embarked on a major shift in economic policy, the key element of which was the return of an interventionist state. As his advisor Jake Sullivan unambiguously announced in an article published in Foreign Policy in February 2020 calling for a move beyond neoliberalism: ""America needs a new economic philosophy.""The new policy combines several major pieces of legislation passed in 2021 and 2022: the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. Added to this are a number of executive actions undertaken since then. Summarized in the White House report ""Bidenomics Is Working,"" published on June 28, Bidenomics first continued the post-Covid-19 economic recovery begun by Trump in the spring of 2020. It then embarked on a vast overhaul of the country's infrastructure, launched an environmental transition centered on the switch to electric cars, and came up with massive support for research and development, prioritizing semiconductor development.In line with Trump, Bidenomics also reinforces proud protectionism, aimed at bringing industrial jobs back to the US and hindering technological competition from China. Other markers of a left-wing economic policy are also there, such as support for trade unions, very visible this fall with the strike by auto industry employees, and the fight against tech giants' monopolies (trials against Google and Amazon began in September).As the presidential campaign for 2024 gets underway, Biden's economic choices and results are being challenged from very different quarters. Leaders on the left of the Democratic Party, for one, are keeping a low profile in their criticism, even though they lament unfinished reforms on student debt reduction and the implementation of a more equalizing tax system. For their part, Trumpist politicians attack the administration from all sides, but in reality, remain in agreement with the principle of a strong, protectionist state.",Economy,aftermath subprime crisis public anger growing social inequality united states reflected right reactionary agitation tea partiers left student protests occupy wall street movement taking office january two weeks unprecedented assault capitol hill donald trumps supporters joe biden set task giving american middle class back means climb social ladder order remove reason populist temptations administration embarked major shift economic policy key element return interventionist state advisor jake sullivan unambiguously announced article published foreign policy february calling move beyond neoliberalism america needs new economic philosophy new policy combines several major pieces legislation passed american rescue plan infrastructure investment jobs act chips science act inflation reduction act added number executive actions undertaken since summarized white house report bidenomics working published june bidenomics first continued post covid economic recovery begun trump spring embarked vast overhaul countrys infrastructure launched environmental transition centered switch electric cars came massive support research development prioritizing semiconductor development line trump bidenomics also reinforces proud protectionism aimed bringing industrial jobs back hindering technological competition china markers left wing economic policy also support trade unions visible fall strike auto industry employees fight tech giants monopolies trials google amazon began september presidential campaign gets underway bidens economic choices results challenged different quarters leaders left democratic party one keeping low profile criticism even though lament unfinished reforms student debt reduction implementation equalizing tax system part trumpist politicians attack administration sides reality remain agreement principle strong protectionist state,aftermath subprim crisi public anger grow social inequ unit state reflect right reactionari agit tea partier left student protest occupi wall street movement take offic januari two week unpreced assault capitol hill donald trump support joe biden set task give american middl class back mean climb social ladder order remov reason populist temptat administr embark major shift econom polici key element return interventionist state advisor jake sullivan unambigu announc articl publish foreign polici februari call move beyond neoliber america need new econom philosophi new polici combin sever major piec legisl pass american rescu plan infrastructur invest job act chip scienc act inflat reduct act ad number execut action undertaken sinc summar white hous report bidenom work publish june bidenom first continu post covid econom recoveri begun trump spring embark vast overhaul countri infrastructur launch environment transit center switch electr car came massiv support research develop priorit semiconductor develop line trump bidenom also reinforc proud protection aim bring industri job back hinder technolog competit china marker left wing econom polici also support trade union visibl fall strike auto industri employe fight tech giant monopoli trial googl amazon began septemb presidenti campaign get underway biden econom choic result challeng differ quarter leader left democrat parti one keep low profil critic even though lament unfinish reform student debt reduct implement equal tax system part trumpist politician attack administr side realiti remain agreement principl strong protectionist state
"'To finance the energy transition, companies will have to reduce their shareholder remuneration'","France's environmental goals can only be financed by transferring income from the wealthiest individuals to the government, to domestic savings, and to companies who invest in the environmental transition.","Energy transition, water management and biodiversity preservation all require renewable energy production facilities; the thermal renovation of housing and other buildings; industrial and transport decarbonization; more efficient management of water consumption; and arrangements and measures for protecting or preserving a sufficient number of plant and animal species.We know more or less how much additional investment is needed to meet these three objectives. With regard to the energy transition, estimates by Selma Mahfouz and Jean Pisani-Ferry suggest a net additional investment requirement of 2.5% of GDP per year ($2.5 trillion per year worldwide). According to available studies, water-related investments amount to $350 billion a year (or 0.35% of global GDP).The global agreement on biodiversity (Kunming-Montreal agreement, 2022) provided for $200 billion a year in national and international funding, but, according to the Paulson Institute, this should be increased to $800 billion in annual investments (instead of the current $140 billion). Finally, to these sums must be added the public expenditures linked to preserving the purchasing power of the most modest households, which will be severely affected by the rise in energy and water prices.If we devote 0.5% of GDP to this support, investment expenditure linked to the ecological transition should represent around 4% of GDP per year for at least 20 years, divided between public and private investment, by businesses and households alike. How can France finance this?The first possibility is by increasing foreign debt. But France already has a current account deficit of 2% of gross domestic product (GDP). That is to say, it borrows 2% of GDP per year because domestic savings are insufficient to cover its investment needs. This would have to be increased to 6% of GDP to cover all of the additional investment required for this transition. This foreign deficit would be extremely difficult to finance: it could trigger a financial crisis of the kind that hit the southern eurozone countries from 2010 onwards.What's more, every country will be faced with the need to invest in this transition, and will need more investment: this means that there will be a ""war"" for access to funds, and therefore a great deal of competition to attract foreign capital.

"'In China, the Belt and Road Initiative is adopting a less spectacular but perhaps more sustainable speed'","Beijing will be injecting 10 times less money than in its previous cooperation program, but these investments will be dedicated to less costly and 'greener' projects, observes Le Monde China correspondent in his column.","What do Moscow State Tchaikovsky Music Conservatory, the National Bank of Serbia, the highway network around Dakar, Peru's Chancay port, a high-tech food preservation research center in South Africa, the Mongolian forest, and a future women's world chess tournament have in common? All are soon to receive support from China as part of its ""Belt and Road Initiative"" investment program. These are just seven examples – out of a total of 369 – of the cooperation agreements that China has signed with some 150 countries and 30 international organizations on the occasion of the third Belt and Road Forum (BRF), chaired by China's leader, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on October 17 and 18.While the main highlights of this major event were the red carpet rolled out in honor of Russian president Vladimir Putin and the many out-of-touch speeches made with no reference either to Ukraine or to the Middle East, the key takeaway from the two days was that China is continuing its global investment program – but also revamping it.Of course, Xi did not express the slightest reservation about the past 10 years, but a close look at the agreements signed shows that China has nonetheless listened to some of the international critics. While large-scale projects are not entirely out of fashion, priority will indeed be given to ""small but beautiful"" investments – as the Chinese president called them. From solar power plants in Poland and Romania to the creation of a research center to combat drought and desertification in Saudi Arabia, ""green projects"" are more numerous. At the same time, the fight against corruption is becoming more systematic. Promoting ""integrity-based"" cooperation with evaluations of partner corporations' ""corporate integrity and compliance"" is one of the eight priorities announced by Xi.It's all as if, after a flying start, the Belt and Road Initiative is adopting a less spectacular but perhaps more sustainable cruising speed. In 2013, China erred on the side of optimism and pride, as the new ""emperor"" needed to establish his stature at the center of the world. This achieved, now comes the time for realism – particularly that of a budgetary kind. For the coming years, Xi has announced credit lines of around €100 billion – a substantial amount, but 10 times less than the commitments of the past 10 years (about €1,000 billion).Is it a failure? Yes and no. Who can deny that China now plays a more important role on the international stage than ever before? The Belt and Road Initiative has largely contributed to this. If China is strong, it is often feared rather than loved – even if this is not true everywhere around the globe. ""Africans only have eyes for China,"" said a European diplomat who has had experience in more than 20 African countries.

"In search of new markets, France is working to establish itself in Uzbekistan","    Following the French president's November 2 visit, major French groups have made the trip to help exploit the natural resources that Uzbekistan is rich in, as the nation seeks to modernize. ","It was certainly a symbolic moment. On Thursday, November 2, just as French President Emmanuel Macron was visiting Uzbekistan, the Orano mining group announced that it had extracted its first 350 kilograms of uranium in the country. The announcement confirmed the extent to which Macron's tour of Central Asia, which took him to Kazakhstan on November 1 and Uzbekistan the following day, was designed to strengthen France's economic presence in the former Russian heartland, now being courted by Turkey, the European Union and China.Orano, EDF, TotalEnergies and Eiffage used Macron's visit to sign contracts at a business forum in Samarkand (eastern Uzbekistan), the legendary former stopover on the Silk Road in the days of Marco Polo. The event was endorsed by Macron and Ukranian President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, with the good relationship evident in the smiles and pats on the back.""Uzbekistan is transforming, and we must be there,"" insisted Macron at the opening of the forum. France supports Uzbekistan's policy of ""regional peace and stability,"" ""openness and modernization,"" Macron stressed, bringing with him no fewer than 20 French business leaders on his tour of Central Asia, as well as deputy ministers Roland Lescure (industry) and Olivier Becht (foreign trade).In a bid to emerge from the economic isolation it has suffered for the past two decades, Uzbekistan is looking to open up to foreign investment. Already present in Kazakhstan, where it operates the world's largest uranium mine, Orano has been prospecting on the Uzbek side. The contract signed in Samarkand officially launches the extraction phase for the Djengeldi uranium mine in the north of the country. According to Macron's office, this is a ""pilot project"" designed to meet environmental standards. France is seeking above all to secure its uranium supplies, both in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, especially since Niger is no longer a reliable source.The visit was also marked by the signing of contracts in the renewable energies sector. French electricity giant EDF signed an agreement for two hydroelectric projects. TotalEnergies signed a memorandum of understanding for the extension of the Tutly photovoltaic power plant, designed to provide better access to electricity for hundreds of thousands of Uzbek households.A hybrid power plant project – solar, wind, and battery storage – was also signed between Voltalia (a renewable energy player founded by the Mulliez family) and the Uzbek Ministry of Energy. French Treasury funds will also be used for the construction of a drinking water supply system in the Kashkadarya region (south) by the Eiffage group. In addition, the French Veolia and Suez groups, which manage district heating and water purification respectively, will continue to develop their operations.",Economy,certainly symbolic moment thursday november french president emmanuel macron visiting uzbekistan orano mining group announced extracted first kilograms uranium country announcement confirmed extent macrons tour central asia took kazakhstan november uzbekistan following day designed strengthen frances economic presence former russian heartland courted turkey european union china orano edf totalenergies eiffage used macrons visit sign contracts business forum samarkand eastern uzbekistan legendary former stopover silk road days marco polo event endorsed macron ukranian president shavkat mirziyoyev good relationship evident smiles pats back uzbekistan transforming must insisted macron opening forum france supports uzbekistans policy regional peace stability openness modernization macron stressed bringing fewer french business leaders tour central asia well deputy ministers roland lescure industry olivier becht foreign trade bid emerge economic isolation suffered past two decades uzbekistan looking open foreign investment already present kazakhstan operates worlds largest uranium mine orano prospecting uzbek side contract signed samarkand officially launches extraction phase djengeldi uranium mine north country according macrons office pilot project designed meet environmental standards france seeking secure uranium supplies kazakhstan uzbekistan especially since niger longer reliable source visit also marked signing contracts renewable energies sector french electricity giant edf signed agreement two hydroelectric projects totalenergies signed memorandum understanding extension tutly photovoltaic power plant designed provide better access electricity hundreds thousands uzbek households hybrid power plant project solar wind battery storage also signed voltalia renewable energy player founded mulliez family uzbek ministry energy french treasury funds also used construction drinking water supply system kashkadarya region south eiffage group addition french veolia suez groups manage district heating water purification respectively continue develop operations,certainli symbol moment thursday novemb french presid emmanuel macron visit uzbekistan orano mine group announc extract first kilogram uranium countri announc confirm extent macron tour central asia took kazakhstan novemb uzbekistan follow day design strengthen franc econom presenc former russian heartland court turkey european union china orano edf totalenergi eiffag use macron visit sign contract busi forum samarkand eastern uzbekistan legendari former stopov silk road day marco polo event endors macron ukranian presid shavkat mirziyoyev good relationship evid smile pat back uzbekistan transform must insist macron open forum franc support uzbekistan polici region peac stabil open modern macron stress bring fewer french busi leader tour central asia well deputi minist roland lescur industri olivi becht foreign trade bid emerg econom isol suffer past two decad uzbekistan look open foreign invest alreadi present kazakhstan oper world largest uranium mine orano prospect uzbek side contract sign samarkand offici launch extract phase djengeldi uranium mine north countri accord macron offic pilot project design meet environment standard franc seek secur uranium suppli kazakhstan uzbekistan especi sinc niger longer reliabl sourc visit also mark sign contract renew energi sector french electr giant edf sign agreement two hydroelectr project totalenergi sign memorandum understand extens tutli photovolta power plant design provid better access electr hundr thousand uzbek household hybrid power plant project solar wind batteri storag also sign voltalia renew energi player found mulliez famili uzbek ministri energi french treasuri fund also use construct drink water suppli system kashkadarya region south eiffag group addit french veolia suez group manag district heat water purif respect continu develop oper
Global wine production hits lowest level since 1961,"    Global output decreased by 7% from last year, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine said. ","Global wine production has fallen this year to its lowest level since 1961 as vineyards were pummelled by extreme weather events, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) said Tuesday, November 7. Output reached 244.1 million hectolitres, down 7% from last year, the intergovernmental body said as it presented its first estimates.""Once again, extreme climatic conditions – such as early frost, heavy rainfall, and drought – have significantly impacted the output of the world vineyard,"" said the organization, which provides data to grape and wine-producing and consuming countries.A number of major producers in the southern hemisphere had significant drops in production. Australia, Argentina, Chile, South Africa and Brazil all saw output drop between 10 and 30%.Italy lost the title of top world producer as its output fell 12%, allowing France to reclaim first place as its production held steady. Spain held onto its position as the world's third largest wine producer although its production fell by 14% and was down 19% from its five-year average.The silver lining, if any, for the industry is that it may help alleviate the market imbalance. In ""a context where global consumption is declining and stocks are high in many regions of the world, the expected low production could bring equilibrium to the world market,"" said the OIV.While the OIV speaks of extreme weather events affecting production, they have yet to definitively link it to climate change, said Iñaki Garcia de Cortazar-Atauri at the French national agronomical research institute INRAE. A specialist on the impact of climate change on agriculture, he said that damage in Italy was due to farmed land not being able to absorb water as well as natural soil.But ""one can observe that extreme weather events are becoming more and more frequent,"" he said, with heat waves or rainy periods striking certain regions and adding to existing problems like mildew.",Economy,global wine production fallen year lowest level since vineyards pummelled extreme weather events international organisation vine wine oiv said tuesday november output reached million hectolitres last year intergovernmental body said presented first estimates extreme climatic conditions early frost heavy rainfall drought significantly impacted output world vineyard said organization provides data grape wine producing consuming countries number major producers southern hemisphere significant drops production australia argentina chile south africa brazil saw output drop italy lost title top world producer output fell allowing france reclaim first place production held steady spain held onto position worlds third largest wine producer although production fell five year average silver lining industry may help alleviate market imbalance context global consumption declining stocks high many regions world expected low production could bring equilibrium world market said oiv oiv speaks extreme weather events affecting production yet definitively link climate change said aki garcia cortazar atauri french national agronomical research institute inrae specialist impact climate change agriculture said damage italy due farmed land able absorb water well natural soil one observe extreme weather events becoming frequent said heat waves rainy periods striking certain regions adding existing problems like mildew,global wine product fallen year lowest level sinc vineyard pummel extrem weather event intern organis vine wine oiv said tuesday novemb output reach million hectolitr last year intergovernment bodi said present first estim extrem climat condit earli frost heavi rainfal drought significantli impact output world vineyard said organ provid data grape wine produc consum countri number major produc southern hemispher signific drop product australia argentina chile south africa brazil saw output drop itali lost titl top world produc output fell allow franc reclaim first place product held steadi spain held onto posit world third largest wine produc although product fell five year averag silver line industri may help allevi market imbal context global consumpt declin stock high mani region world expect low product could bring equilibrium world market said oiv oiv speak extrem weather event affect product yet definit link climat chang said aki garcia cortazar atauri french nation agronom research institut inra specialist impact climat chang agricultur said damag itali due farm land abl absorb water well natur soil one observ extrem weather event becom frequent said heat wave raini period strike certain region ad exist problem like mildew
Climate: 'Blackrock may have found a way to patch things up with Big Oil',"Considered a 'woke' company in Texas, the world's leading financier is not very popular among the state's Big Oil circles. But BlackRock has just signed a major agreement with Occidental Petroleum to invest in a plant for the direct capture and burial of carbon dioxide.","BlackRock has a problem with Texas. In this Republican stronghold, the world's leading financier is seen as a ""woke"" corporation, the ultimate insult. And their ""wokeness"" has grown stronger after the group took a stand in favor of more responsible social and environmental practices.Their commitments have often been contested by environmentalists, but they have established Blackrock's reputation in Houston and Dallas. So it's hardly surprising that the leading oil-producing state in the United States doesn't take this kind of attitude from a company that manages over $9 trillion in assets worldwide.It may have found a way to patch things up with the Big Oil cowboys who pride themselves on their mud-stained boots in the Permian Basin oil fields, America's largest and its biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. BlackRock just signed a major agreement with local star Occidental Petroleum (Oxy). It will invest $500 million in a plant for the direct capture and burial of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It will own 40% of what promises to be, by 2025, the world's largest unit in this field. It alone plans to swallow 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. That's far more than the 36,000 tonnes promised by the world's only industrial facility in this field, located in Iceland.Oil companies see nothing but advantages in this carbon capture technology, either in the air or right out of the plant's chimneys. The activity is close to their core expertise and enables them to continue exploiting their oil rather than having to venture into other, far less lucrative businesses, such as wind or solar power. It could even be a very profitable business for Oxy. Firstly, because it has already sold carbon credits to companies such as Airbus, which are keen to green their balance sheets, but also because this will enable it to... produce more oil. The CO2 buried in the Permian deposits will push the remaining oil out.Environmental organizations are understandably furious and see this as a ploy to resist the energy transition and the associated reduction in hydrocarbon production. This technology, subsidized by the federal government, has yet to prove its effectiveness on an industrial scale, and its cost is currently prohibitive in relation to the emissions reductions it promises.According to the International Energy Agency, the most optimistic scenarios predict that 85 million tonnes of CO2 will be processed in this type of plant in 2030 and 980 in 2050. In other words, peanuts, compared to the 40 billion tonnes of carbon released every year by human activity. It's hardly the revolution that will save black gold from its doomed fate.",Economy,blackrock problem texas republican stronghold worlds leading financier seen woke corporation ultimate insult wokeness grown stronger group took stand favor responsible social environmental practices commitments often contested environmentalists established blackrocks reputation houston dallas hardly surprising leading oil producing state united states doesnt take kind attitude company manages trillion assets worldwide may found way patch things big oil cowboys pride mud stained boots permian basin oil fields americas largest biggest emitter greenhouse gases blackrock signed major agreement local star occidental petroleum oxy invest million plant direct capture burial carbon dioxide atmosphere promises worlds largest unit field alone plans swallow tonnes carbon dioxide year thats far tonnes promised worlds industrial facility field located iceland oil companies see nothing advantages carbon capture technology either air right plants chimneys activity close core expertise enables continue exploiting oil rather venture far less lucrative businesses wind solar power could even profitable business oxy firstly already sold carbon credits companies airbus keen green balance sheets also enable produce oil buried permian deposits push remaining oil environmental organizations understandably furious see ploy resist energy transition associated reduction hydrocarbon production technology subsidized federal government yet prove effectiveness industrial scale cost currently prohibitive relation emissions reductions promises according international energy agency optimistic scenarios predict million tonnes processed type plant words peanuts compared billion tonnes carbon released every year human activity hardly revolution save black gold doomed fate,blackrock problem texa republican stronghold world lead financi seen woke corpor ultim insult woke grown stronger group took stand favor respons social environment practic commit often contest environmentalist establish blackrock reput houston dalla hardli surpris lead oil produc state unit state doesnt take kind attitud compani manag trillion asset worldwid may found way patch thing big oil cowboy pride mud stain boot permian basin oil field america largest biggest emitt greenhous gase blackrock sign major agreement local star occident petroleum oxi invest million plant direct captur burial carbon dioxid atmospher promis world largest unit field alon plan swallow tonn carbon dioxid year that far tonn promis world industri facil field locat iceland oil compani see noth advantag carbon captur technolog either air right plant chimney activ close core expertis enabl continu exploit oil rather ventur far less lucr busi wind solar power could even profit busi oxi firstli alreadi sold carbon credit compani airbu keen green balanc sheet also enabl produc oil buri permian deposit push remain oil environment organ understand furiou see ploy resist energi transit associ reduct hydrocarbon product technolog subsid feder govern yet prove effect industri scale cost current prohibit relat emiss reduct promis accord intern energi agenc optimist scenario predict million tonn process type plant word peanut compar billion tonn carbon releas everi year human activ hardli revolut save black gold doom fate
Polish truckers block Ukraine border crossings as tensions grow over imports,"    Polish truckers' organizations have blocked three border crossings between the two countries, denouncing 'unfair competition' from their Ukrainian counterparts. ","""Polish farmers are afraid of cheap Ukrainian wheat, we're afraid of Ukrainian truckers. We're being swamped by their trucks."" Jacek Sokol is the owner of a road transport company and one of the leading protesters at the Ukrainian border. He summed up the mood of the country's truckers with these words to the Polish media. Since Monday, November 6, several industry organizations have been blocking the Dorohusk, Hrebenne and Korczowa border crossings in south-eastern Poland. Almost all road traffic has been paralyzed. One truck per hour is allowed through, with the exception of humanitarian convoys and aid to the Ukrainian army. Their strike action could last several weeks.The demonstrators, who blame the fall in their income on the liberalization of border transport rules for Ukraine by the European Union (EU) since the start of the invasion in February 2022, are demanding that the regulations in force before the outbreak of war be reinstated. At that time, Ukrainian trucks could only enter Poland with a special permit. ""Certain solutions are being introduced without consulting us. We're being presented with a fait accompli, and we don't understand what's going on,"" said Sokol.Polish drivers have also denounced the lack of control over Ukrainian trucks, which, in theory, have no authorization to transport goods between EU countries. ""In practice, most trucks arrive empty, pick up loads in Poland and take them all over Europe. They simply take our work away from us,"" said Bartosz Jasinski, owner of a trucking company. According to industry organizations, nearly 900,000 Ukrainian trucks entered Poland this year, compared with 180,000 per year before the war.Truckers feel discriminated against and are demanding checks on the Ukrainian electronic queuing system for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) at the border. Polish drivers traveling to Ukraine are forced to wait up to two weeks empty before returning to Poland. For Warsaw, which has the largest HGV fleet in the EU, accounting for almost 25% of trucks on the road, this is a key issue. In 2022, the road and logistics sector was worth 375 billion zlotys (€84 billion), or 7% of the country's gross domestic product and 6.5% of jobs.The Ukrainian government said on Tuesday that it had yet to receive an ""official request"" from Polish truckers. ""If there is an official and reasoned position from our Polish partners, we are open to constructive dialogue,"" the infrastructure ministry said in a statement, saying it was ""in constant communication"" with Polish and European authorities to ""resolve"" this crisis and ""unblock the checkpoints as soon as possible."" ""The blocking of the border is detrimental to the interests of both countries,"" said the Ukrainian ministry.

India becomes first nation to land a spacecraft near the Moon's south pole,    Prime Minister Narendra Modi waved an Indian flag on a live broadcast from the BRICS group summit in South Africa to announce the mission's success. ,"India on Wednesday, August 23, landed a spacecraft near the moon's south pole, an uncharted territory that scientists believe could hold vital reserves of frozen water and precious elements.A lander with a rover inside touched down on the lunar surface at 6:04 local time, sparking cheers and applause among the space scientists watching in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru. After a failed attempt nearly four years ago, India made history by becoming the first country to touch down near the little-explored south pole region and joined the United States, the Soviet Union and China in achieving a moon landing.Prime Minister Narendra Modi smiled broadly and waved an Indian flag on a live broadcast to announce the mission's success as a triumph that extended beyond his country's borders. ""On this joyous occasion I would like to address the people of the world,"" said Modi from the sidelines of the BRICS diplomatic summit in South Africa. ""India's successful moon mission is not just India's alone,"" he added. ""This success belongs to all of humanity.""India's successful landing comes just days after Russia's Luna-25, which was aiming for the same lunar region, spun into an uncontrolled orbit and crashed. It would have been the first successful Russian lunar landing after a gap of 47 years. Russia's head of the state-controlled space corporation Roscosmos attributed the failure to the lack of expertise due to the long break in lunar research that followed the last Soviet mission to the moon in 1976.People across India, home to the world's largest population, crowded around televisions in offices, shops, restaurants and homes. Thousands prayed Tuesday for the success of the mission with oil lamps on the river banks, temples and religious places, including the holy city of Varanasi in northern India.India's Chandrayaan-3 – ""moon craft"" in Sanskrit – took off from a launchpad in Sriharikota in southern India on July 14. ""India's pursuit of space exploration reaches a remarkable milestone with the impending Chandrayaan-3 Mission, poised to achieve a soft landing on the lunar surface. This achievement marks a significant step forward for Indian Science, Engineering, Technology, and Industry, symbolizing our nation's progress in space exploration,"" the Indian Space Research Organization said in a statement earlier on Wednesday.They said a successful Chandrayaan-3 landing would be monumental in fueling curiosity and sparking a passion for exploration among youth. ""It generates a profound sense of pride and unity as we collectively celebrate the prowess of Indian science and technology.

Indian spacecraft lands near the Moon's south pole in world first,"    India has joined the elite club of countries to have landed a spacecraft on the Moon, after the US, the USSR and China. Chandrayaan-3 landed successfully, four days after the failure of a Russian mission. ","At 14:34 Central European Summer Time, India joined the exclusive club of countries that have landed a spacecraft on the Moon, after the United States, the USSR and China. For around 20 minutes on Wednesday, August 23, the country remained riveted to its screens. All eyes were on Chandrayaan-3, whose Vikram lander began its crucial descent toward the Moon. The spacecraft, which gradually slowed, finally landed gently near the south pole, an as yet unexplored region. A world first, and yet another milestone in the history of India's space program.This was the second attempt. In 2019, a first Indian mission failed after the craft entered orbit around the Moon, but lost contact with the team on Earth.Cheers and applause rang out in Bangalore on Wednesday from the control center of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). More than 7 million people also followed the moon landing live on ISRO's YouTube channel. ""India’s successful moon mission is not just India’s alone,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Johannesburg, where he was attending the BRICS summit (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). ""This success belongs to all of humanity,"" he declared, adding ""It will help moon missions by other countries in the future.""Since the departure of Chandrayaan-3 – Sanskrit for ""lunar ship"" – on July 14 from the launch pad in Sriharikota, in the south of the country, enthusiasm has been running high, reaching a crescendo. On Wednesday, thousands of people across India prayed for the mission's success, and schools across the country organized special ceremonies.The Indian space mission, which cost only $75 million (€69 million) – less than the budget of the film Gravity, estimated at $100 million – has succeeded where Russia failed four days earlier. Luna-25 crashed on August 19, two days before its scheduled lunar landing in the same region, following an uncontrolled shift in orbit. The failure was attributed to a loss of expertise on the part of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, due to the long hiatus in lunar research following the last Soviet mission to the Moon in 1976, and the Kremlin's lack of interest in this field.ISRO, founded in 1969 with a relatively modest budget, excels in frugal space engineering. It has helped strengthen the country's weather forecasting and telecommunications capabilities. The private space sector is booming. ""This is the genius of Indian engineers,"" said Mathieu Weiss, space advisor and representative in India of the French National Center for Space Studies (CNES).

Women are more vulnerable to heat wave related mortality than men,"    A number of studies have attempted to shed light on the causes of women's excess mortality during hot weather, and suggest various explanations, both physiological and social. ","In many countries, particularly Europe, more women than men die during heat waves. Some researchers have attempted to explain this discrepancy due not only to the fact that women live longer but also to physiological and behavioral factors. During the 2003 heat wave in France, the number of heat-related deaths among people over the age of 55 was 15% higher among women than men of the same age, according to a study published by several researchers at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in 2006.France is far from being an exception. A number of studies have been conducted in the Netherlands, for example, showing significant gender differences in heatwave deaths. In one of the most comprehensive studies on the subject, published in 2021, researchers from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam identified several possible causes. Among them are differences in sweating, cardiovascular tension, the ratio of body surface area to mass, and the greater propensity of women to live alone or be active in the home. As women live longer – up to 81 in Europe, compared with 75 for men – and are therefore over-represented among the elderly vulnerable to heat, the researchers adjusted their results to avoid overestimating female mortality.The researchers' first explanation is that women sweat less and lose less heat. ""Sweating is a particularly effective method of cooling, and in this sense, women, who have a lower capacity to perspire and evaporate sweat, are at a disadvantage,"" said Hein Daanen, a physiology researcher at the Free University of Amsterdam and co-author of the 2021 study. ""When the air temperature exceeds the body temperature [on average between 36°C and 37°C], the only way for the body to lose heat is by sweating,"" said Mike Tipton, a researcher at the University of Portsmouth and author of several studies on the subject.But that's not all – as they regulate their body temperature more by increasing blood transfers to the skin, women are more likely to develop cardiovascular problems in hot weather. ""When it's very hot, there's a sort of detour effect, as blood, which flows more to the skin, can't go as far to other parts of the body, such as, for example, the heart. As the heart receives less blood, it compensates by beating faster, which raises cardiovascular pressure – already higher in women than men – and increases the associated risks, such as stroke,"" Daanen said.Another hypothesis put forward by the researchers is that differences in height and weight affect the ability to spread heat throughout the body. ""If we establish the 'body surface area/mass ratio, it is more important in women, even if this may seem counter-intuitive. A man can have a body surface area of 2 square meters and a weight of 100 kg, giving a ratio of 2/100, compared with 1.5 square meters and 50 kg for a woman, giving a ratio of 1.5/50. As the ratio is higher for women, they have a greater propensity to absorb heat, albeit with less mass to radiate it,"" Tipton said.",Science,many countries particularly europe women men die heat waves researchers attempted explain discrepancy due fact women live longer also physiological behavioral factors heat wave france number heat related deaths among people age higher among women men age according study published several researchers french national institute health medical research inserm france far exception number studies conducted netherlands example showing significant gender differences heatwave deaths one comprehensive studies subject published researchers vrije universiteit amsterdam identified several possible causes among differences sweating cardiovascular tension ratio body surface area mass greater propensity women live alone active home women live longer europe compared men therefore represented among elderly vulnerable heat researchers adjusted results avoid overestimating female mortality researchers first explanation women sweat less lose less heat sweating particularly effective method cooling sense women lower capacity perspire evaporate sweat disadvantage said hein daanen physiology researcher free university amsterdam author study air temperature exceeds body temperature average way body lose heat sweating said mike tipton researcher university portsmouth author several studies subject thats regulate body temperature increasing blood transfers skin women likely develop cardiovascular problems hot weather hot theres sort detour effect blood flows skin cant far parts body example heart heart receives less blood compensates beating faster raises cardiovascular pressure already higher women men increases associated risks stroke daanen said another hypothesis put forward researchers differences height weight affect ability spread heat throughout body establish body surface area mass ratio important women even may seem counter intuitive man body surface area square meters weight giving ratio compared square meters woman giving ratio ratio higher women greater propensity absorb heat albeit less mass radiate tipton said,mani countri particularli europ women men die heat wave research attempt explain discrep due fact women live longer also physiolog behavior factor heat wave franc number heat relat death among peopl age higher among women men age accord studi publish sever research french nation institut health medic research inserm franc far except number studi conduct netherland exampl show signific gender differ heatwav death one comprehens studi subject publish research vrije universiteit amsterdam identifi sever possibl caus among differ sweat cardiovascular tension ratio bodi surfac area mass greater propens women live alon activ home women live longer europ compar men therefor repres among elderli vulner heat research adjust result avoid overestim femal mortal research first explan women sweat less lose less heat sweat particularli effect method cool sens women lower capac perspir evapor sweat disadvantag said hein daanen physiolog research free univers amsterdam author studi air temperatur exce bodi temperatur averag way bodi lose heat sweat said mike tipton research univers portsmouth author sever studi subject that regul bodi temperatur increas blood transfer skin women like develop cardiovascular problem hot weather hot there sort detour effect blood flow skin cant far part bodi exampl heart heart receiv less blood compens beat faster rais cardiovascular pressur alreadi higher women men increas associ risk stroke daanen said anoth hypothesi put forward research differ height weight affect abil spread heat throughout bodi establish bodi surfac area mass ratio import women even may seem counter intuit man bodi surfac area squar meter weight give ratio compar squar meter woman give ratio ratio higher women greater propens absorb heat albeit less mass radiat tipton said
The tide guarded its secrets for centuries,Series,"The weather forecast was far from great that morning on the Normandy coast. But the tide was set to be low at dawn, and the last light of the full moon would make it possible to make out the obstacles and mines scattered along the shore by the German army. Then the tide would rise, helping the troops to gain a foothold. American strategists and their allies therefore decided on June 6, 1944, as the date for kicking off the D-Day landings at Arromanches-les-Bains (code name Gold Beach) and surrounding beaches. The ebb and flow of the English Channel went down in history that day, but unlike cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes and great ocean currents, tides don't get their own name.Timings and amplitudes of the ebb and flow in coastal waters: For thousands of years, soldiers, fishermen, pirates and sailors of all stripes have known the value of this essential information. Long before the advent of computers and satellites, they tried to predict the occurrence and intensity of such events by observing this natural phenomenon, rather than understanding it. As Pierre Simon, Marquis de Laplace – an exceptional astronomer, mathematician and physicist – put it at the turn of the 18th century, this was ""the most thorny problem of all celestial mechanics.""The principle of the tides could be summarily presented as a sort of subtle clockwork system that drives a colossal electric beater spinning on itself. Tides are the result of multiple waves propagating across the oceans at different speeds, losing energy as they come into contact with the continental shelves. Once there, their behavior is highly variable: turbulent or languid, depending on the topography of the coastline. Occasionally, they rush into the mouths of rivers, where they create tidal bores – in other words, counter-currents. The North Atlantic offers two spectacular illustrations of the force of liquid masses in motion. At the entrance to the English Channel, the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel experiences extraordinary tidal ranges (or amplitudes), reaching 15 meters high during high tide periods, which see the sea retreat up to 15 kilometers over this shallow seabed. In eastern Canada, water heights vary by up to a record 17 meters in front of the Bay of Fundy's tortuous coastline.It's hard to understand these phenomena viewed from a beach or a cliff. Frustrated, astronomers and other thinkers eager for discovery turned their backs on the tides for centuries. ""Tides long remained an unsolved 'old subject',"" wrote David Edgar Cartwright in his 1999 scientific history of the tides Tides. A Scientific History, featuring a portrait of Isaac Newton on the cover. The Newton tribute is well-deserved, since the scientist's revelations at the end of the 17th century about the law of universal gravitation governing the mutual attraction of the sun, moon and Earth, led to a fundamental leap forward in our understanding of the principle of high and low tides.",Science,weather forecast far great morning normandy coast tide set low dawn last light full moon would make possible make obstacles mines scattered along shore german army tide would rise helping troops gain foothold american strategists allies therefore decided june date kicking day landings arromanches les bains code name gold beach surrounding beaches ebb flow english channel went history day unlike cyclones typhoons hurricanes great ocean currents tides dont get name timings amplitudes ebb flow coastal waters thousands years soldiers fishermen pirates sailors stripes known value essential information long advent computers satellites tried predict occurrence intensity events observing natural phenomenon rather understanding pierre simon marquis laplace exceptional astronomer mathematician physicist put turn century thorny problem celestial mechanics principle tides could summarily presented sort subtle clockwork system drives colossal electric beater spinning tides result multiple waves propagating across oceans different speeds losing energy come contact continental shelves behavior highly variable turbulent languid depending topography coastline occasionally rush mouths rivers create tidal bores words counter currents north atlantic offers two spectacular illustrations force liquid masses motion entrance english channel bay mont saint michel experiences extraordinary tidal ranges amplitudes reaching meters high high tide periods see sea retreat kilometers shallow seabed eastern canada water heights vary record meters front bay fundys tortuous coastline hard understand phenomena viewed beach cliff frustrated astronomers thinkers eager discovery turned backs tides centuries tides long remained unsolved old subject wrote david edgar cartwright scientific history tides tides scientific history featuring portrait isaac newton cover newton tribute well deserved since scientists revelations end century law universal gravitation governing mutual attraction sun moon earth led fundamental leap forward understanding principle high low tides,weather forecast far great morn normandi coast tide set low dawn last light full moon would make possibl make obstacl mine scatter along shore german armi tide would rise help troop gain foothold american strategist alli therefor decid june date kick day land arromanch le bain code name gold beach surround beach ebb flow english channel went histori day unlik cyclon typhoon hurrican great ocean current tide dont get name time amplitud ebb flow coastal water thousand year soldier fishermen pirat sailor stripe known valu essenti inform long advent comput satellit tri predict occurr intens event observ natur phenomenon rather understand pierr simon marqui laplac except astronom mathematician physicist put turn centuri thorni problem celesti mechan principl tide could summarili present sort subtl clockwork system drive coloss electr beater spin tide result multipl wave propag across ocean differ speed lose energi come contact continent shelv behavior highli variabl turbul languid depend topographi coastlin occasion rush mouth river creat tidal bore word counter current north atlant offer two spectacular illustr forc liquid mass motion entranc english channel bay mont saint michel experi extraordinari tidal rang amplitud reach meter high high tide period see sea retreat kilomet shallow seab eastern canada water height vari record meter front bay fundi tortuou coastlin hard understand phenomena view beach cliff frustrat astronom thinker eager discoveri turn back tide centuri tide long remain unsolv old subject wrote david edgar cartwright scientif histori tide tide scientif histori featur portrait isaac newton cover newton tribut well deserv sinc scientist revel end centuri law univers gravit govern mutual attract sun moon earth led fundament leap forward understand principl high low tide
Pharaoh Amenhotep II gave his wet nurse the royal treatment,"    Upon her death around 3,450 years ago, the woman received embalming usually reserved for the elite. This secret was revealed by the analysis of the residue of two canopic jars used to store her viscera found in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings. ","Back in the time of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, on the banks of the Nile, lived Senetnay. She was to become ""she who fed the flesh of the god"": nursemaid to a baby who would later ascend the Egyptian throne as Amenhotep II. The pharaoh must have been truly grateful, for Senetnay was treated with the utmost care after her death. Not only was she buried in the Valley of the Kings, but, as revealed by an international study published on Thursday, August 31, in Scientific Reports, the remains of the royal wet nurse were embalmed to a high standard.However, the remains in question no longer exist. The authors of this multi-disciplinary study, which combines archaeology, chemistry and botany, only examined two of the four canopic jars in which Senetnay's viscera (liver, lungs, stomach, intestines) were stored by the embalmers during the mummification of her body. These limestone jars were removed in 1900 from ""Tomb Kings Valley 42"" in the Valley of the Kings by the British explorer Howard Carter, who 22 years later was to discover the amazing untouched tomb of Tutankhamun. Kept in the August-Kestner museum in Hanover, Germany, the two jars analyzed by the researchers contained Senetnay's lungs and liver. A third jar can be found at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and the fourth has disappeared from circulation.How did the scientists go about this? ""The first step,"" explained Thibaut Devièse, senior lecturer at Aix-Marseille University and co-author of the study, ""was to use a scalpel to remove residue from the surface of the items."" Six samples were taken from the bottom and sides of the jars. The researchers then used solvents to extract various chemical compounds from the Egyptian balsams, which then had to be identified using several techniques.The difficulty lies in the fact that, while some molecules can be preserved over millennia, others are altered and only the product of this degradation is found. ""We need to successfully reconnect the molecules identified to the original materials,"" explained Thibaut Devièse. It is like tracing the family tree of these molecules. This research involved a great deal of work upstream. ""Natural reference substances are artificially aged in the laboratory, for example by heating them or placing them under UV lamps,"" added the chemist. ""This enables us to see the reaction patterns and tells us that a specific molecule is the result of another's degradation.""As a result, the ingredients used by the embalmer to preserve Senetnay's organs are some of the richest of all those known for this period. A mixture of animal fats and vegetable oils, bitumen, beeswax, substances from conifers, aromatic plants and a final component, which is either pistachio resin or dammar, a resin from trees found only in Southeast Asia. In both cases, there are imported products, like bitumen and conifers. The researchers were also surprised to find larixol, a molecule suggesting the presence of larch resin, a tree now found only in the Alps and Eastern Europe.",Science,back time dynasty egypt banks nile lived senetnay become fed flesh god nursemaid baby would later ascend egyptian throne amenhotep pharaoh must truly grateful senetnay treated utmost care death buried valley kings revealed international study published thursday august scientific reports remains royal wet nurse embalmed high standard however remains question longer exist authors multi disciplinary study combines archaeology chemistry botany examined two four cano senetnays viscera liver lungs stomach intestines stored embalmers mummification body limestone jars removed tomb kings valley valley kings british explorer howard carter years later discover amazing untouched tomb tutankhamun kept august kestner museum hanover germany two jars analyzed researchers contained senetnays lungs liver third jar found egyptian museum cairo fourth disappeared circulation scientists first step explained thibaut devi senior lecturer aix marseille university author study use scalpel remove residue surface items six samples taken bottom sides jars researchers used solvents extract various chemical compounds egyptian balsams identified using several techniques difficulty lies fact molecules preserved millennia others altered product degradation found need successfully reconnect molecules identified original materials explained thibaut devi like tracing family tree molecules research involved great deal work upstream natural reference substances artificially aged laboratory example heating placing lamps added chemist enables see reaction patterns tells specific molecule result anothers degradation result ingredients used embalmer preserve senetnays organs richest known period mixture animal fats vegetable oils bitumen beeswax substances conifers aromatic plants final component either pistachio resin dammar resin trees found southeast asia cases imported products like bitumen conifers researchers also surprised find larixol molecule suggesting presence larch resin tree found alps eastern europe,back time dynasti egypt bank nile live senetnay becom fed flesh god nursemaid babi would later ascend egyptian throne amenhotep pharaoh must truli grate senetnay treat utmost care death buri valley king reveal intern studi publish thursday august scientif report remain royal wet nurs embalm high standard howev remain question longer exist author multi disciplinari studi combin archaeolog chemistri botani examin two four cano senetnay viscera liver lung stomach intestin store embalm mummif bodi limeston jar remov tomb king valley valley king british explor howard carter year later discov amaz untouch tomb tutankhamun kept august kestner museum hanov germani two jar analyz research contain senetnay lung liver third jar found egyptian museum cairo fourth disappear circul scientist first step explain thibaut devi senior lectur aix marseil univers author studi use scalpel remov residu surfac item six sampl taken bottom side jar research use solvent extract variou chemic compound egyptian balsam identifi use sever techniqu difficulti lie fact molecul preserv millennia other alter product degrad found need success reconnect molecul identifi origin materi explain thibaut devi like trace famili tree molecul research involv great deal work upstream natur refer substanc artifici age laboratori exampl heat place lamp ad chemist enabl see reaction pattern tell specif molecul result anoth degrad result ingredi use embalm preserv senetnay organ richest known period mixtur anim fat veget oil bitumen beeswax substanc conif aromat plant final compon either pistachio resin dammar resin tree found southeast asia case import product like bitumen conif research also surpris find larixol molecul suggest presenc larch resin tree found alp eastern europ
Whales were not nearly as numerous three centuries ago as believed,"    By calculating genome mutations between generations, a team of researchers has revised downward the North Atlantic cetacean population prior to industrial fishing. ","Professor of marine biology at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, Per Palsboll is careful to put things into perspective: ""We're just scientists. When making a decision on whaling, there are many criteria to take into account, and our results are just one element."" Nonetheless, the article his team published in Science on Friday, September 1, is certain to make waves during the forthcoming discussions between states on the course of action to take. It concluded that the humpback whale population in the North Atlantic before the era of industrial fishing – three centuries ago – was much smaller than previously thought: just over 20,000 individuals, a far cry from the 150,000 envisaged. This means that the current population, estimated at 12,000 humpback whales, is much healthier than previously thought. Norway, the only European country to continue fishing for cetaceans, should welcome the news.As spectacular as it is, this result is only one consequence of the study presented in Science. The aim of the researchers from nine different countries, coordinated by the University of Groningen and the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown (Maine, US), was in fact to determine what geneticists call the mutation rate of baleen whales, in other words the probability of a mutation occurring in the genome of an individual between two generations. These mutations are essential: When they are favorable, they enable a species to adapt to changes in its environment; when they are harmful, they lead to the development of pathologies.Until now, scientists have used two methods to calculate this value. The first involved multiplying the sequencing of individuals to determine the genetic diversity of the population, then estimating the date of appearance of this species in the tree of life and the time spent between two generations, and deducing the famous rate. The problem is that these last two values are very difficult to assess accurately. The second method consists in comparing the DNA of current individuals with that of ancient specimens. However, fossils of sufficiently high quality must be available.The new technique is quite different. Much simpler in principle, it simply compares the DNA of mother/father/child trios. It has already been used extensively with groups of animals bred in captivity. But this lifestyle in itself modifies all the parameters. In the wild, wolves, blue tits, seals and platypuses have benefited from this ""pedigree"" method. Palsboll's team used it for the first time on four whale species: blue, humpback, bowhead and fin whales. ""The difficulty lies in having these trios available,"" said Marcos Suarez Menendez, first author of the publication, ""and while females often stay with their calves, the males can be very far away.""",Science,professor marine biology university groningen netherlands per palsboll careful put things perspective scientists making decision whaling many criteria take account results one element nonetheless article team published science friday september certain make waves forthcoming discussions states course action take concluded humpback whale population north atlantic era industrial fishing three centuries ago much smaller previously thought individuals far cry envisaged means current population estimated humpback whales much healthier previously thought norway european country continue fishing cetaceans welcome news spectacular result one consequence study presented science aim researchers nine different countries coordinated university groningen center coastal studies provincetown maine fact determine geneticists call mutation rate baleen whales words probability mutation occurring genome individual two generations mutations essential favorable enable species adapt changes environment harmful lead development pathologies scientists used two methods calculate value first involved multiplying sequencing individuals determine genetic diversity population estimating date appearance species tree life time spent two generations deducing famous rate problem last two values difficult assess accurately second method consists comparing dna current individuals ancient specimens however fossils sufficiently high quality must available new technique quite different much simpler principle simply compares dna mother father child trios already used extensively groups animals bred captivity lifestyle modifies parameters wild wolves blue tits seals platypuses benefited pedigree method palsbolls team used first time four whale species blue humpback bowhead fin whales difficulty lies trios available said marcos suarez menendez first author publication females often stay calves males far away,professor marin biolog univers groningen netherland per palsbol care put thing perspect scientist make decis whale mani criteria take account result one element nonetheless articl team publish scienc friday septemb certain make wave forthcom discuss state cours action take conclud humpback whale popul north atlant era industri fish three centuri ago much smaller previous thought individu far cri envisag mean current popul estim humpback whale much healthier previous thought norway european countri continu fish cetacean welcom news spectacular result one consequ studi present scienc aim research nine differ countri coordin univers groningen center coastal studi provincetown main fact determin geneticist call mutat rate baleen whale word probabl mutat occur genom individu two gener mutat essenti favor enabl speci adapt chang environ harm lead develop patholog scientist use two method calcul valu first involv multipli sequenc individu determin genet divers popul estim date appear speci tree life time spent two gener deduc famou rate problem last two valu difficult assess accur second method consist compar dna current individu ancient specimen howev fossil suffici high qualiti must avail new techniqu quit differ much simpler principl simpli compar dna mother father child trio alreadi use extens group anim bred captiv lifestyl modifi paramet wild wolv blue tit seal platypus benefit pedigre method palsbol team use first time four whale speci blue humpback bowhead fin whale difficulti lie trio avail said marco suarez menendez first author public femal often stay calv male far away
'The sale of Rafales to Saudi Arabia would be a success by default for French aircraft in the ruthless arms business',Saudi Arabia is considering purchasing 54 aircraft from Dassault Aviation after a German veto blocked its purchase of 48 Typhoon jets due to human rights concerns.,"Saudi Arabia's purchase of French fighter jets would be a major economic coup for Dassault Aviation and a political coup for France. The Saudis are considering purchasing 54 Rafales and asking the aircraft manufacturer to make an offer by November 10, revealed La Tribune Dimanche on October 22. Talks have been confirmed by Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu, with no further details.There's a ""Rafale moment,"" as Eric Trappier, the manufacturer's CEO, declared at the end of August. The first exports of the plane were not until the Egyptian order of 2015. Trappier is convinced that the multirole aircraft (roles include air defense, reconnaissance, nuclear deterrence and anti-ship combat) is an alternative to American and Russian aircraft. So much so that he is giving ""priority"" to the fifth-generation Rafale, scheduled for 2030, relegating to second place the air combat system of the future being developed with Airbus Defense and Space of Germany and Indra of Spain.A sale to Riyadh would first and foremost be a commercial success. Not as important as the 80 aircraft acquired by the United Arab Emirates, but on the same scale as the orders from Egypt and India. The latter is currently finalizing the purchase of 26 additional aircraft. Rich in petrodollars and with a defense budget of $70 billion (€66 billion) in 2022, up for the first time since 2018, Saudi Arabia is the world's fifth-largest arms buyer.The operation would also reinforce the strategic choice made by General Charles de Gaulle at the start of the Fifth Republic: a complete army model based on an industry capable of supplying almost all its equipment. As manufacturers cannot survive on national orders alone, this implies major exports of military equipment. The Rafale fulfills this role, with 261 of its 453 orders delivered to other countries.Finally, it would be a political success for Paris against the United States, and above all against Europe. The Saudi Air Force is equipped with Boeing F-15s, European Eurofighter Typhoons and British Tornados.

"India launches spacecraft to study Sun, days after successful Moon landing","    The Aditya-L1 spacecraft took off on board a satellite launcher from the Sriharikota space center in southern India. It will head to the L1 point of the Earth-Sun system, which offers an uninterrupted view of the Sun. ","India launched its first space mission to study the Sun on Saturday, September 2, less than two weeks after a successful uncrewed landing near the south-polar region of the Moon. The Aditya-L1 spacecraft took off on board a satellite launch vehicle from the Sriharikota space center in southern India on a quest to study the Sun from a point about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from Earth. The spacecraft is equipped with seven payloads to study the Sun's corona, chromosphere, photosphere and solar wind, the Indian Space Research Organization said.After over an hour, the ISRO said the launch was accomplished successfully. ""The vehicle has placed the satellite precisely into its intended orbit. India’s first solar observatory has begun its journey to the destination of Sun-Earth L1 point,"" ISRO posted on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter.India became the first country to land a spacecraft near the Moon's south pole on August 23 — a historic voyage to uncharted territory that scientists believe could hold vital reserves of frozen water. After a failed attempt to land on the Moon in 2019, India joined the United States, the Soviet Union and China as only the fourth country to achieve this milestone. The Sun study, combined with India's successful Moon landing, would completely change the image of ISRO in the world community, said Manish Purohit, a former ISRO scientist.The Aditya-L1 was headed for the L1 point of the Earth-Sun system, which affords an uninterrupted view of the Sun, ISRO said. ""This will provide a greater advantage of observing solar activities and their effect on space weather in real-time."" The satellite is scheduled to take 125 days to reach the L1 point.Once in place, the satellite would provide reliable forewarning of an onslaught of particles and radiation from heightened solar activity that has the potential to knock out power grids on Earth, said B.R. Guruprasad, a space scientist, in an article in The Times of India newspaper. The advanced warning can protect the satellites that are the backbone of global economic structure as well as the people living in space stations.""Those seven payloads are going to study the Sun as a star in all the possible spectrum positions that we have visible, ultraviolet, and X-ray (...) It's like we're going to get a black and white image, the color image and the high-definition image, 4K image of the Sun, so that we don't miss out on anything that is happening on the Sun,"" Purohit said.",Science,india launched first space mission study sun saturday september less two weeks successful uncrewed landing near south polar region moon aditya spacecraft took board satellite launch vehicle sriharikota space center southern india quest study sun point million kilometers miles earth spacecraft equipped seven payloads study suns corona chromosphere photosphere solar wind indian space research organization said hour isro said launch accomplished successfully vehicle placed satellite precisely intended orbit india first solar observatory begun journey destination sun earth point isro posted platform formerly known twitter india became first country land spacecraft near moons south pole august historic voyage uncharted territory scientists believe could hold vital reserves frozen water failed attempt land moon india joined united states soviet union china fourth country achieve milestone sun study combined indias successful moon landing would completely change image isro world community said manish purohit former isro scientist aditya headed point earth sun system affords uninterrupted view sun isro said provide greater advantage observing solar activities effect space weather real time satellite scheduled take days reach point place satellite would provide reliable forewarning onslaught particles radiation heightened solar activity potential knock power grids earth said guruprasad space scientist article times india newspaper advanced warning protect satellites backbone global economic structure well people living space stations seven payloads going study sun star possible spectrum positions visible ultraviolet ray like going get black white image color image high definition image image sun dont miss anything happening sun purohit said,india launch first space mission studi sun saturday septemb less two week success uncrew land near south polar region moon aditya spacecraft took board satellit launch vehicl sriharikota space center southern india quest studi sun point million kilomet mile earth spacecraft equip seven payload studi sun corona chromospher photospher solar wind indian space research organ said hour isro said launch accomplish success vehicl place satellit precis intend orbit india first solar observatori begun journey destin sun earth point isro post platform formerli known twitter india becam first countri land spacecraft near moon south pole august histor voyag unchart territori scientist believ could hold vital reserv frozen water fail attempt land moon india join unit state soviet union china fourth countri achiev mileston sun studi combin india success moon land would complet chang imag isro world commun said manish purohit former isro scientist aditya head point earth sun system afford uninterrupt view sun isro said provid greater advantag observ solar activ effect space weather real time satellit schedul take day reach point place satellit would provid reliabl forewarn onslaught particl radiat heighten solar activ potenti knock power grid earth said guruprasad space scientist articl time india newspap advanc warn protect satellit backbon global econom structur well peopl live space station seven payload go studi sun star possibl spectrum posit visibl ultraviolet ray like go get black white imag color imag high definit imag imag sun dont miss anyth happen sun purohit said
The third sex of the African dwarf mouse,"    Three-quarters of the females in this rodent species have a Y sex chromosome. Although they display male behavior, they are nonetheless fertile. ","The African dwarf mouse (Mus minutoides) may be one of the world's smallest rodents, but it has invented nothing less than a third sex. This quirk of nature was discovered by a French specialist in evolutionary genetics. ""I set up the world's only breeding facility for this species, after capturing specimens in South Africa,"" said Frédéric Veyrunes of the CNRS (University of Montpellier). In 2009, he was astonished to discover that at least three-quarters of this rodent's females, instead of carrying two X sex chromosomes – like almost all placental mammal females – have one X and one Y chromosome, which is normally the prerogative of males. Fewer than a quarter of this dwarf mouse's females, however, are classically XX.Female mice with a Y chromosome? Well, yes. Provided, however, that a mutation has struck a gene (we don't know which) on their X chromosome. This mutated X, or X*, distinguishes them from males, who are classically XY. According to one possible scenario, ""the mutated X* gene could produce a protein that inhibits the action of the SRY protein, which normally triggers the differentiation of the embryo's sexual organs towards the male pathway,"" said Veyrunes.What's even more astonishing is that the X*Y females of this graceful rodent are perfectly fertile, while the very rare XY females that are sometimes born in other mammal species, including our own, are always sterile. Better still, the X*Y females of this mouse are even more fertile than XX females. ""Their better ovulation rate compensates for the fact that a quarter of their embryos, the YYs, are non-viable. In the end, their reproductive success is better,"" said the geneticist.Another surprise is that this third sex has acquired male behaviors. X*Y females are thus more aggressive than XXs, have a bite strength equivalent to that of males, travel longer distances to explore their environment and also deliver better parental care than XXs. In short, they are super-females with male characteristics.""If the Y chromosome has passed to both males and females, it may eventually no longer be essential in this species,"" said Veyrunes, who is keen to study another dwarf mouse, Mus triton, in which males now have only one sex chromosome, the X, and females too, an X*. ""The loss of the Y would be the next evolutionary step, in Mus minutoides.""",Science,african dwarf mouse mus minutoides may one worlds smallest rodents invented nothing less third sex quirk nature discovered french specialist evolutionary genetics set worlds breeding facility species capturing specimens south africa said ric veyrunes cnrs university montpellier astonished discover least three quarters rodents females instead carrying two sex chromosomes like almost placental mammal females one one chromosome normally prerogative males fewer quarter dwarf mouses females however classically female mice chromosome well yes provided however mutation struck gene dont know chromosome mutated distinguishes males classically according one possible scenario mutated gene could produce protein inhibits action sry protein normally triggers differentiation embryos sexual organs towards male pathway said veyrunes whats even astonishing females graceful rodent perfectly fertile rare females sometimes born mammal species including always sterile better still females mouse even fertile females better ovulation rate compensates fact quarter embryos yys non viable end reproductive success better said geneticist another surprise third sex acquired male behaviors females thus aggressive xxs bite strength equivalent males travel longer distances explore environment also deliver better parental care xxs short super females male characteristics chromosome passed males females may eventually longer essential species said veyrunes keen study another dwarf mouse mus triton males one sex chromosome females loss would next evolutionary step mus minutoides,african dwarf mous mu minutoid may one world smallest rodent invent noth less third sex quirk natur discov french specialist evolutionari genet set world breed facil speci captur specimen south africa said ric veyrun cnr univers montpelli astonish discov least three quarter rodent femal instead carri two sex chromosom like almost placent mammal femal one one chromosom normal prerog male fewer quarter dwarf mous femal howev classic femal mice chromosom well ye provid howev mutat struck gene dont know chromosom mutat distinguish male classic accord one possibl scenario mutat gene could produc protein inhibit action sri protein normal trigger differenti embryo sexual organ toward male pathway said veyrun what even astonish femal grace rodent perfectli fertil rare femal sometim born mammal speci includ alway steril better still femal mous even fertil femal better ovul rate compens fact quarter embryo yy non viabl end reproduct success better said geneticist anoth surpris third sex acquir male behavior femal thu aggress xx bite strength equival male travel longer distanc explor environ also deliv better parent care xx short super femal male characterist chromosom pass male femal may eventu longer essenti speci said veyrun keen studi anoth dwarf mous mu triton male one sex chromosom femal loss would next evolutionari step mu minutoid
Superconductors: US study suspected of fraud,"    In March, a team from the University of Rochester published a paper in 'Nature' on an alloy with promising properties. Since then, doubts have been growing about the reliability of the data and the integrity of its main co-author. ","The year 2023 will go down as a milestone in the history of superconductivity, as a material made in the US has been whipping up a storm after earlier claims of breakthroughs by South Korean researchers. Few people, however, believe in the reliability of the result. Suspicions of dishonesty have even been cast against its principal co-author, Ranga Dias, a professor at the University of Rochester (New York State), who has already had two science papers withdrawn from the scientific literature because of doubts about the data he provided. He has also been accused of plagiarism in his thesis.On March 8, the US team made a splash in the journal Nature. It said it had manufactured a material that becomes superconducting as soon as the temperature drops below just 21°C high pressure – 10,000 times the pressure exerted by the atmosphere. Still, this remains 200 times lower than the previous record.Questions about the results' quality immediately arose, and several teams tried to replicate the experiment without success. The latest one, from China, posted its negative findings on July 1 on the prepublication site Arxiv.org, explaining that while the material's resistance dropped, it remained non-zero. Only one other US team was able to test a Rochester sample and achieve electrical measurements compatible with those published. ""We can't say it's a replication because the sample is very dirty and inhomogeneous. Magnetic measurements are also missing,"" pointed out Hai-Hu Wen, the co-author of one of the negative studies at Nanjing University (China). ""That's in progress,"" said Russell Hemley, a professor at the University of Illinois responsible for these experiments and Dias' former co-author.An accumulation of facts further undermined confidence in Rochester's result. The latest: On September 1, the journal Nature published a warning on the page of the March 8 paper stating that ""the reliability of data presented in this manuscript is currently in question. Appropriate editorial action will be taken once this matter is resolved.""On August 15, the same kind of warning led to the retraction of an earlier paper signed by Dias and published in Physical Review Letters in 2021. The journal had enlisted the help of four experts, as revealed by US journalist Daniel Garisto in Nature back on July 25. Their reports, which Le Monde was able to consult, are devastating. In it, they explained that the data supposedly provided from experiments are not represented in the graphs that were published! Worse still, they confirmed that these graphs were partly decals of graphs previously published for a different material and under different pressures.",Science,year milestone history superconductivity material made whipping storm earlier claims breakthroughs south korean researchers people however believe reliability result sus dishonesty even cast principal author ranga dias professor university rochester new york state already two science papers withdrawn scientific literature doubts data provided also accused plagiarism thesis march team made splash journal nature said manufactured material becomes superconducting soon temperature drops high pressure times pressure exerted atmosphere still remains times lower previous record questions results quality immediately arose several teams tried replicate experiment without success latest one china posted negative findings july prepublication site arxiv org explaining materials resistance dropped remained non zero one team able test rochester sample achieve electrical measurements compatible published cant say replication sample dirty inhomogeneous magnetic measurements also missing pointed hai wen author one negative studies nanjing university china thats progress said russell hemley professor university illinois responsible experiments dias former author accumulation facts undermined confidence rochesters result latest september journal nature published warning page march paper stating reliability data presented manuscript currently question appropriate editorial action taken matter resolved august kind warning led retraction earlier paper signed dias published physical review letters journal enlisted help four experts revealed journalist daniel garisto nature back july reports monde able consult devastating explained data supposedly provided experiments represented graphs published worse still confirmed graphs partly decals graphs previously published different material different pressures,year mileston histori superconduct materi made whip storm earlier claim breakthrough south korean research peopl howev believ reliabl result su dishonesti even cast princip author ranga dia professor univers rochest new york state alreadi two scienc paper withdrawn scientif literatur doubt data provid also accus plagiar thesi march team made splash journal natur said manufactur materi becom superconduct soon temperatur drop high pressur time pressur exert atmospher still remain time lower previou record question result qualiti immedi aros sever team tri replic experi without success latest one china post neg find juli prepubl site arxiv org explain materi resist drop remain non zero one team abl test rochest sampl achiev electr measur compat publish cant say replic sampl dirti inhomogen magnet measur also miss point hai wen author one neg studi nanj univers china that progress said russel hemley professor univers illinoi respons experi dia former author accumul fact undermin confid rochest result latest septemb journal natur publish warn page march paper state reliabl data present manuscript current question appropri editori action taken matter resolv august kind warn led retract earlier paper sign dia publish physic review letter journal enlist help four expert reveal journalist daniel garisto natur back juli report mond abl consult devast explain data supposedli provid experi repres graph publish wors still confirm graph partli decal graph previous publish differ materi differ pressur
What exactly is superconductivity?,"    This physical property of a material, which translates into the absence of resistance to the passage of current, has many applications, such as medical MRI. It also raises hopes for research into nuclear fusion and quantum computing. ","In an electric cable, the current is carried by electrons whose movement is disturbed by the atoms of the metal (such as copper) and the charges of neighboring electrons. This resistance heats up the material, reducing its efficiency. By lowering the temperature significantly, the metal can undergo a transition and become superconducting, i.e. no longer resisting the current. In a loop circuit, electrons rotate ad infinitum.The first demonstration of this effect, in 1911, with solid mercury cooled to -268.95°C by liquid helium, earned Dutchman Heike Kamerlingh Onnes the 1913 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1987, Germany's Johannes Georg Bednorz and Switzerland's Karl Alexander Müller were awarded the same Nobel Prize, 16 months after their discovery of a copper-based ceramic that superconducts at -238°C. Others followed, reaching a record of -138°C, paving the way for numerous applications.For example, medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires powerful magnetic fields to rotate atoms. Created by coils, these fields require a powerful current and therefore generate high temperatures. With helium-cooled superconducting cables, these constraints disappear. Even manufacturers of high-voltage cables have been deploying these technologies in recent years, not only to reduce losses but also to limit the size or number of copper cables required.In 2022, Nexans announced such an installation at Montparnasse train station in Paris, following a demonstration in Germany in 2014 over one kilometer. The cable is cooled with liquid nitrogen to around -195°C. On the same energy front, most nuclear fusion projects require magnetic fields to trap fuel, the intensity of which is such that only superconducting cables can generate them.Another property of these materials is the stuff of dreams. They have the ability to expel surrounding magnetic fields, making it possible to dream of trains levitating above magnetized rails. Japanese trains already run in this way, but using a more energy-intensive process.Finally, on a completely different scale, superconductors are among the candidates for the realization of a quantum computer, a calculating machine promising to solve previously unsolvable operations. A miniature component made from a sandwich of an insulator and two superconducting layers behaves like an artificial atom with two states. These ""qubits,"" which are both 0 and 1, to use computer science jargon, are the key to more efficient calculations.",Science,electric cable current carried electrons whose movement disturbed atoms metal copper charges neighboring electrons resistance heats material reducing efficiency lowering temperature significantly metal undergo transition become superconducting longer resisting current loop circuit electrons rotate infinitum first demonstration effect solid mercury cooled liquid helium earned dutchman heike kamerlingh onnes nobel prize physics germanys johannes georg bednorz switzerlands karl alexander ller awarded nobel prize months discovery copper based ceramic superconducts others followed reaching record paving way numerous applications example medical magnetic resonance imaging mri requires powerful magnetic fields rotate atoms created coils fields require powerful current therefore generate high temperatures helium cooled superconducting cables constraints disappear even manufacturers high voltage cables deploying technologies recent years reduce losses also limit size number copper cables required nexans announced installation montparnasse train station paris following demonstration germany one kilometer cable cooled liquid nitrogen around energy front nuclear fusion projects require magnetic fields trap fuel intensity superconducting cables generate another property materials stuff dreams ability expel surrounding magnetic fields making possible dream trains levitating magnetized rails japanese trains already run way using energy intensive process finally completely different scale superconductors among candidates realization quantum computer calculating machine promising solve previously unsolvable operations miniature component made sandwich insulator two superconducting layers behaves like artificial atom two states qubits use computer science jargon key efficient calculations,electr cabl current carri electron whose movement disturb atom metal copper charg neighbor electron resist heat materi reduc effici lower temperatur significantli metal undergo transit becom superconduct longer resist current loop circuit electron rotat infinitum first demonstr effect solid mercuri cool liquid helium earn dutchman heik kamerlingh onn nobel prize physic germani johann georg bednorz switzerland karl alexand ller award nobel prize month discoveri copper base ceram superconduct other follow reach record pave way numer applic exampl medic magnet reson imag mri requir power magnet field rotat atom creat coil field requir power current therefor gener high temperatur helium cool superconduct cabl constraint disappear even manufactur high voltag cabl deploy technolog recent year reduc loss also limit size number copper cabl requir nexan announc instal montparnass train station pari follow demonstr germani one kilomet cabl cool liquid nitrogen around energi front nuclear fusion project requir magnet field trap fuel intens superconduct cabl gener anoth properti materi stuff dream abil expel surround magnet field make possibl dream train levit magnet rail japanes train alreadi run way use energi intens process final complet differ scale superconductor among candid realiz quantum comput calcul machin promis solv previous unsolv oper miniatur compon made sandwich insul two superconduct layer behav like artifici atom two state qubit use comput scienc jargon key effici calcul
'Made in France' products hit hard by inflation,"    Households facing budget restraints are now opting for cheaper products that may be imported. In response to this, French brands are trying to fight back. ","For France Cauchy, manager of the La Bel'France boutique in Cluny (eastern France), which exclusively sells French products, the summer of 2023 failed to live up to its promises. ""Footfall, sales and average order value are down by around 20%,"" said the shopkeeper. ""Nothing is selling as well. Even the €5 or €6 soaps didn't do as well this year!""This can be attributed to both the weather and French vacationers choosing to travel abroad rather than stay within France... but that's not the only reason. This pretty Burgundy town is not the only place experiencing disenchantment with ""Made in France"" products. As is the case with organic products, sales of which fell by 13% in the first half of the year, products made in France are also feeling the impact of inflation. Households facing budget restraints are now opting for cheaper products that may be imported.""The price signal is extremely strong, and that affects all walks of life. Not everyone can afford to buy pants at €120 or a T-shirt at €45,"" said Christèle Merter, president of La Gentle Factory, a French clothing brand (despite its name) that she created in 2013.""We saw consumer spending fall over several stages,"" said Merter. ""The first jolts were felt in June 2022. Things went from bad to worse, and September [2023] was really bad."" The brand then launched a promotion to mark its tenth anniversary. ""All our items were discounted by 50% on our website. Within 10 hours, we made 10% of our annual turnover,"" boasted the company director. Proof that consumers aren't turning their back on French goods per se, but rather the prices attached to them.""Since spring, 'made in France' brands have seen a drop in sales of up to 30%, sometimes more,"" said Olivier Ducatillon, president of the Union of Textile Industries. ""It's a real problem. When the economy becomes the main focus, where products come from is no longer top priority."" While textiles and footwear aren't doing too well, French home furnishings aren't faring much better, with sales down by as much as 40%, according to Charles Huet, president of La carte française, a gift card distributed by works councils, allowing people to treat themselves to French products.Fabienne Delahaye, president of MIF Expo, the ""made in France"" trade show taking place in Paris from November 9 to 12, assures us however that ""there is still an appetite.

UK rejoins EU science program it left due to Brexit,"    The United Kingdom has rejoined the science research scheme Horizon Europe after reaching a 'bespoke' deal, opening the door to UK researchers being able to apply for EU research grants. ","Britain is to rejoin the Horizon Europe science research programme under a new bespoke deal, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's office and the EU said on Thursday.""As part of the new deal negotiated over the last six months, the prime minister has secured improved financial terms of association to Horizon Europe that are right for the UK,"" a statement said.Horizon is a European Union scheme that funds research projects which the UK says it has been excluded from for the past three years, following Brexit. The deal follows a call between Sunak and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday.""The EU and UK are key strategic partners and allies, and today's agreement proves that point. We will continue to be at the forefront of global science and research,"" von der Leyen said in a statement.The deal means that UK researchers can apply immediately for grants and bid to take part in projects under the Horizon programme, the UK government statement said. ""Horizon will give UK companies and research institutions unrivalled opportunities to lead global work to develop new technologies and research projects, in areas from health to AI,"" it added.Britain previously said it had been excluded from the EU's flagship Horizon Europe programme that funds research, nuclear regulator Euratom and the Copernicus satellite monitoring group. London said it considered the delay to be a breach of the post-Brexit deal. Just over a year ago, it launched dispute procedures with the EU over the exclusion, using a mechanism set out in a post-Brexit deal.The British government said that its inability to participate in science and technology programmes was causing ""serious damage"" both in the UK and EU countries.

French study reopens the debate on the impact of screen time for kids,    An analysis of a large sample of children suggests that the context of use and family factors play a more important role than screen time. Several specialists say this finding should be treated with caution. ,"To what extent does exposing young children to screens impair their development? In a new study in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry on August 29, a French team is reviving this burning debate.In fact, the results of the study led its authors to relativize the negative impact of exposure times to television, computers, games consoles, tablets and smartphones on the brains of children aged 2, 3 and a half, and 5 and a half. They even describe the deleterious effect of these screens as ""modest,"" once the child's family environment and lifestyle are taken into account. But as soon as these results were published, experts were divided over their interpretation, with some warning of the dangers of downplaying the detrimental effects of screens, which are far from harmless.""The context in which screens are used plays an important role, probably more so than the amount of time spent in front of them,"" said Jonathan Bernard of the Center for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics (National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM); National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment; and Paris Cité and Sorbonne-Paris-Nord universities), who led the study.The authors analyzed data from nearly 14,000 children monitored as part of the French ELFE cohort (French Longitudinal Study From Infancy Onward). This is the first cohort in metropolitan France dedicated to the regular tracking of children born in 2011, from birth to adulthood.The researchers assessed the toddlers' language development at age 2, their non-verbal reasoning at age 3.5 and their overall cognitive development at ages 3.5 and 5.5. They also measured the influence on this development of many other factors linked to the family's socio-economic status (parents' level of education, working hours, income, presence of siblings, etc.); the child itself (gender, whether born prematurely or not); and daily activities (childcare arrangements, frequency of activities shared with parents, sleep time, time spent outdoors, screen-free play, etc.).The team confirmed that the amount of time children are exposed to screens is detrimental to their brain development. But they added a nuance to this finding: This relationship appeared to be much weaker when the family environment is properly taken into account. According to the authors' observations, the impact of screens on cognitive development drops by 40% to 80% once the influence of family factors is considered, and by a further 10% to 20% once the child's other activities are also factored in.

"2023 Ig Nobel Prizes celebrates backward reading, counting nostril hairs and tasting rocks",    The 33rd Ig Nobel Prize ceremony on Thursday celebrated wacky scientific studies and unconventional discoveries via webcast. ,"If you can effortlessly read ""ylsseltroffe nac uoy fI"" at the start of this sentence, demonstrating your ability to read backward, you might have been a perfect candidate for the study that won the communication category prize at the 33rd Ig Nobel Prize awards ceremony on Thursday, September 14. For those not familiar with the previous 32 editions, the Ig Nobel Prize is the ultimate reward in silly and refreshing ""improbable science."" The field is intent on demonstrating that the scientific method has a serious answer to wacky questions and that there is no negative correlation between wearing a lab coat and having a sense of humor.Normally, the awards ceremony takes place in the Sanders Theater at Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts) but it has been held via videoconference since 2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic. Prioritizing the health of the spectators may not be so good for laughs but at least the tradition is preserved. The winners receive a 10-trillion former Zimbabwean dollar bill, a denomination that – despite its astronomical number of zeros – no longer has any value in the aftermath of the country's hyperinflation.Each year, 10 Ig Nobel Prizes are awarded in as many categories, which fluctuate according to the mood of the jury led by American Marc Abrahams, the mastermind behind the good-natured extravaganza. For example, the 2023 edition does not include an Ig Nobel Peace Prize, but there is one for Literature, awarded to researchers who have studied the sensations experienced when a word is written ""many, many, many, many, many"" times. The experiment is said to provoke a feeling of jamais-vu (the opposite of déjà-vu) in some people. Your humble reporter can confirm that they have never seen the word ""many"" written five times in a row in the columns of Le Monde.In the Chemistry and Geology category, the prize goes to an essay explaining why geologists are in the habit of licking – or even tasting – the rocks they collect or extract in the field. On the subject of taste buds, the winning study in Nutrition was that of two Japanese researchers who wondered whether it was possible to enhance taste sensations by eating with chopsticks and drinking with straws through which an electric current was being passed. It was celebrated as a good way of creating juicier dishes.Body experiments are a classic feature of the awards. The Ig Nobel Prize for Medicine went to a study that counted the number of nostril hairs in dead human bodies. In the Public Health category, the Ig Nobel Prize was awarded to several works led by South Korea's Park Seung-min, who developed toilets where human excretions are systematically analyzed to monitor the health of toilet-goers.",Science,effortlessly read ylsseltroffe nac uoy start sentence demonstrating ability read backward might perfect candidate study communication category prize nobel prize awards ceremony thursday september familiar previous editions nobel prize ultimate reward silly refreshing improbable science field intent demonstrating scientific method serious answer wacky questions negative correlation wearing lab coat sense humor normally awards ceremony takes place sanders theater harvard university cambridge massachusetts held via videoconference since covid pandemic prioritizing health spectators may good laughs least tradition preserved winners receive trillion former zimbabwean dollar bill denomination despite astronomical number zeros longer value aftermath countrys hyperinflation year nobel prizes awarded many categories fluctuate according mood jury led american marc abrahams mastermind behind good natured extravaganza example edition include nobel peace prize one literature awarded researchers studied sensations experienced word written many many many many many times experiment said provoke feeling jamais opposite people humble reporter confirm never seen word many written five times row columns monde chemistry geology category prize goes essay explaining geologists habit licking even tasting rocks collect extract field subject taste buds winning study nutrition two japanese researchers wondered whether possible enhance taste sensations eating chopsticks drinking straws electric current passed celebrated good way creating juicier dishes body experiments classic feature awards nobel prize medicine went study counted number nostril hairs dead human bodies public health category nobel prize awarded several works led south koreas park seung min developed toilets human excretions systematically analyzed monitor health toilet goers,effortlessli read ylsseltroff nac uoy start sentenc demonstr abil read backward might perfect candid studi commun categori prize nobel prize award ceremoni thursday septemb familiar previou edit nobel prize ultim reward silli refresh improb scienc field intent demonstr scientif method seriou answer wacki question neg correl wear lab coat sens humor normal award ceremoni take place sander theater harvard univers cambridg massachusett held via videoconfer sinc covid pandem priorit health spectat may good laugh least tradit preserv winner receiv trillion former zimbabwean dollar bill denomin despit astronom number zero longer valu aftermath countri hyperinfl year nobel prize award mani categori fluctuat accord mood juri led american marc abraham mastermind behind good natur extravaganza exampl edit includ nobel peac prize one literatur award research studi sensat experienc word written mani mani mani mani mani time experi said provok feel jamai opposit peopl humbl report confirm never seen word mani written five time row column mond chemistri geolog categori prize goe essay explain geologist habit lick even tast rock collect extract field subject tast bud win studi nutrit two japanes research wonder whether possibl enhanc tast sensat eat chopstick drink straw electr current pass celebr good way creat juicier dish bodi experi classic featur award nobel prize medicin went studi count number nostril hair dead human bodi public health categori nobel prize award sever work led south korea park seung min develop toilet human excret systemat analyz monitor health toilet goer
Cairo's historic City of the Dead under threat from urban expansion,"    Starting in 2020, ongoing road construction has been encroaching upon the Islamic necropolis on the outskirts of Egypt's capital. Despite objections from activists, numerous tombs and mausoleums of historical significance have been destroyed. ","The concrete slabs of a motorway bridge cover the mausoleum of Taha Hussein, which appears crushed under the weight of the structure. The funerary monument of the Egyptian writer, one of the fathers of the Arab literary renaissance (""Nahda""), buried in Cairo's City of the Dead in 1973, was narrowly saved from demolition. In May 2022, his descendants were alarmed by the appearance of a red cross and the inscription ""demolition"" on the wall of the entrance of the monument. The same inscription had already appeared on numerous tombs in the Islamic necropolis, located within the perimeter of road construction.The construction project, launched in 2020, gutted the site, which is over 1,400 years old and has been on the World Heritage List since 1979. Located at the foot of Mokattam, the desert plateau overlooking Cairo, it houses the dead from the beginning of the Islamic era to the present day. Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, Islamic saints, caliphs and kings, poets and commoners have found their final resting places near the mausoleums of Imam al-Shafi, founder of a school of Islamic jurisprudence, and Sayyida Nafisa, an Islamic scholar. The housing crisis has also prompted over 2 million Egyptians to come and live among the dead.Faced with pressure from the writer's granddaughter, the Egyptian authorities backed down. They spared Taha Hussein's tomb, albeit with some damage. However, hundreds of other tombs and mausoleums have been destroyed as part of construction efforts over the past three years to decongest Cairo and link it to the new administrative capital, whose construction, 45 kilometers to the east, has swallowed up billions of euros.No part of Cairo is now safe from bulldozers. In the overcrowded metropolis of 22 million inhabitants, deteriorating informal settlements have been razed and green spaces swallowed up to build bridges and housing complexes. These projects are the hallmark of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has presented himself as a modernizer since coming to power in 2013, and who has made the army the prime contractor for his major projects. The ""Greater Cairo 2050"" development plan, which calls for replacing informal settlements with green spaces and relocating cemeteries outside the city, has been revised.Demolition machinery appeared for the first time in the City of the Dead in the summer of 2020 to dig two roads through the two largest necropolises in the south and east. The road network project, unveiled in late 2021, plans to destroy more than 2,700 tombs. ""This is a crime against Egypt's heritage and history. The government wants to demolish everything and leave only 75 monuments. All they're thinking about is the value of the land,"" said Galila el-Kadi, professor of urban planning and architecture and author of a monograph on the City of the Dead.",Science,concrete slabs motorway bridge cover mausoleum taha hussein appears crushed weight structure funerary monument egyptian writer one fathers arab literary renaissance nahda buried cairos city dead narrowly saved demolition may descendants alarmed appearance red cross inscription demolition wall entrance monument inscription already appeared numerous tombs islamic necropolis located within perimeter road construction construction project launched gutted site years old world heritage list since located foot mokattam desert plateau overlooking cairo houses dead beginning islamic era present day companions prophet muhammad islamic saints caliphs kings poets commoners found final resting places near mausoleums imam shafi founder school islamic jurisprudence sayyida nafisa islamic scholar housing crisis also prompted million egyptians come live among dead faced pressure writers granddaughter egyptian authorities backed spared taha husseins tomb albeit damage however hundreds tombs mausoleums destroyed part construction efforts past three years decongest cairo link new administrative capital whose construction kilometers east swallowed billions euros part cairo safe bulldozers overcrowded metropolis million inhabitants deteriorating informal settlements razed green spaces swallowed build bridges housing complexes projects hallmark president abdel fattah sisi presented modernizer since coming power made army prime contractor major projects greater cairo development plan calls replacing informal settlements green spaces relocating cemeteries outside city revised demolition machinery appeared first time city dead summer dig two roads two largest necropolises south east road network project unveiled late plans destroy tombs crime egypts heritage history government wants demolish everything leave monuments theyre thinking value land said galila kadi professor urban planning architecture author monograph city dead,concret slab motorway bridg cover mausoleum taha hussein appear crush weight structur funerari monument egyptian writer one father arab literari renaiss nahda buri cairo citi dead narrowli save demolit may descend alarm appear red cross inscript demolit wall entranc monument inscript alreadi appear numer tomb islam necropoli locat within perimet road construct construct project launch gut site year old world heritag list sinc locat foot mokattam desert plateau overlook cairo hous dead begin islam era present day companion prophet muhammad islam saint caliph king poet common found final rest place near mausoleum imam shafi founder school islam jurisprud sayyida nafisa islam scholar hous crisi also prompt million egyptian come live among dead face pressur writer granddaught egyptian author back spare taha hussein tomb albeit damag howev hundr tomb mausoleum destroy part construct effort past three year decongest cairo link new administr capit whose construct kilomet east swallow billion euro part cairo safe bulldoz overcrowd metropoli million inhabit deterior inform settlement raze green space swallow build bridg hous complex project hallmark presid abdel fattah sisi present modern sinc come power made armi prime contractor major project greater cairo develop plan call replac inform settlement green space reloc cemeteri outsid citi revis demolit machineri appear first time citi dead summer dig two road two largest necropolis south east road network project unveil late plan destroy tomb crime egypt heritag histori govern want demolish everyth leav monument theyr think valu land said galila kadi professor urban plan architectur author monograph citi dead
"'India currently accounts for 2% of the global space market, a fraction of its capabilities'","Mathieu Weiss, the representative for the French National Centre for Space Studies in India, writes that India's Chandrayaan-3 probe landing on the moon is just the beginning of a new chapter in the sub-continent's space power.","On August 23, the Vikram lander module from India's Chandrayaan-3 probe touched down on the moon. Broadcast live, its success thrilled the Indian nation to the core, leading to the declaration of August 23 as National Space Day. It was a technological feat that roused a moment of popular fervor unprecedented in the country's recent history. In 2008, India's inaugural lunar mission aimed to place an orbiter in lunar orbit. It was through one of its instruments that the presence of ice in the deep craters of the lunar south pole was confirmed. Interestingly, the Vikram lander's touchdown at this precise location was anything but accidental. India has its sights firmly set on having a permanent presence on the moon – robotic first, then human.India began its space program by orienting it towards developing its population, at a time when the United States, the Soviet Union, France and the United Kingdom were pursuing the logic of power. Vikram Sarabhai, a young physicist from Ahmedabad, set up the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969, just 11 years after the creation of the North American Space Agency (NASA), and eight years after that of the French National Centre for Space Studies (CNES). With France's help, India had already launched dozens of French Centaure sounding rockets and a few dragon rockets; their first space cooperation agreement with CNES dates back to 1964.Today, India has become a major space power, orbiting Mars and the moon. It is preparing a mission to Venus but is also determined to put its own astronauts or ""vyomanauts"" into space. The first space flight with people aboard is scheduled for the end of 2025. Europe still lacks this capability. In a second phase, the ISRO is planning a small autonomous space station, made up of inflatable modules, for long-duration missions.But beyond space exploration, India is also distinguished for its observations of Earth and telecommunications missions, which have made life easier for its citizens. In this respect, joint French-Indian satellites have been providing the population for decades with invaluable operational services in areas such as agriculture, forecasting monsoons and water resource management. They have also given French and Indian researchers an indispensable niche for climate monitoring.With the strength of its technological capabilities, and credibility ratings comparable to those of western players, India is now preparing to enter the global market on a massive scale. The country currently accounts for 2% of the global space economy, a fraction of its capabilities, which it has amply demonstrated. But it is not happenstance: The sector's governance was hardly geared towards commercial exploitation; the ISRO holds a virtual monopoly on design and production. In-depth reforms are underway to redress the balance.",Science,august vikram lander module indias chandrayaan probe touched moon broadcast live success thrilled indian nation core leading declaration august national space day technological feat roused moment popular fervor unprecedented countrys recent history indias inaugural lunar mission aimed place orbiter lunar orbit one instruments presence ice deep craters lunar south pole confirmed interestingly vikram landers touchdown precise location anything accidental india sights firmly set permanent presence moon robotic first human india began space program orienting towards developing population time united states soviet union france united kingdom pursuing logic power vikram sarabhai young physicist ahmedabad set indian space research organisation isro years creation north american space agency nasa eight years french national centre space studies cnes frances help india already launched dozens french centaure sounding rockets dragon rockets first space cooperation agreement cnes dates back today india become major space power orbiting mars moon preparing mission venus also determined put astronauts vyomanauts space first space flight people aboard scheduled end europe still lacks capability second phase isro planning small autonomous space station made inflatable modules long duration missions beyond space exploration india also distinguished observations earth telecommunications missions made life easier citizens respect joint french indian satellites providing population decades invaluable operational services areas agriculture forecasting monsoons water resource management also given french indian researchers indispensable niche climate monitoring strength technological capabilities credibility ratings comparable western players india preparing enter global market massive scale country currently accounts global space economy fraction capabilities amply demonstrated happenstance sectors governance hardly geared towards commercial exploitation isro holds virtual monopoly design production depth reforms underway redress balance,august vikram lander modul india chandrayaan probe touch moon broadcast live success thrill indian nation core lead declar august nation space day technolog feat rous moment popular fervor unpreced countri recent histori india inaugur lunar mission aim place orbit lunar orbit one instrument presenc ice deep crater lunar south pole confirm interestingli vikram lander touchdown precis locat anyth accident india sight firmli set perman presenc moon robot first human india began space program orient toward develop popul time unit state soviet union franc unit kingdom pursu logic power vikram sarabhai young physicist ahmedabad set indian space research organis isro year creation north american space agenc nasa eight year french nation centr space studi cne franc help india alreadi launch dozen french centaur sound rocket dragon rocket first space cooper agreement cne date back today india becom major space power orbit mar moon prepar mission venu also determin put astronaut vyomanaut space first space flight peopl aboard schedul end europ still lack capabl second phase isro plan small autonom space station made inflat modul long durat mission beyond space explor india also distinguish observ earth telecommun mission made life easier citizen respect joint french indian satellit provid popul decad invalu oper servic area agricultur forecast monsoon water resourc manag also given french indian research indispens nich climat monitor strength technolog capabl credibl rate compar western player india prepar enter global market massiv scale countri current account global space economi fraction capabl ampli demonstr happenst sector govern hardli gear toward commerci exploit isro hold virtual monopoli design product depth reform underway redress balanc
Libya's ancient city of Cyrene survived Storm Daniel,"    The extreme flash flooding  spared the ruins of the ancient necropolis, but the damage to a number of other significant archaeological sites remains unknown. ","The ruins of the ancient Hellenic necropolis of Cyrene, the largest in North Africa, had survived the chaos of war, rampant urbanization and the plague of looting. They also seem to have survived the devastating passage of Storm Daniel, which killed at least 4,000 people. Information is imprecise at present, as the flooding complicated access to the site. ""But no major destruction has yet been recorded,"" reported archaeologist Vincent Michel, who was in constant contact with the Tripoli and Cyrene antiquities departments. ""It will be necessary to carry out a mission to assess the exact state of the site.""A number of tombs were nevertheless damaged and the foundations of many monuments below the sanctuary of Demeter were affected by the torrents of mud. The slabs of the ancient road linking the sanctuary of Apollo to the upper town were also ripped up by the flow of water. ""The rushing water carried away a great deal of earth and stone, but none of the buildings in the sanctuary of Apollo collapsed,"" explained Michel. ""But they will have to be consolidated, as the large quantity of stagnant water makes them fragile.""The ancient city of Apollonia, known for its thermal baths and ancient port, does not appear to have suffered significant damage. ""But, as with the other coastal sites in Cyrenaica, water attacked the site and amplified the erosion,"" lamented Michel. For the time being, it is impossible to assess the extent of the damage to the Latrun site, some 30 kilometers from Apollonia, as the road leading to it was destroyed. ""However, the situation appears to be very critical in Derna, which boasts a magnificent mosque and a monastery on the seafront, among other jewels.""",Science,ruins ancient hellenic necropolis cyrene largest north africa survived chaos war rampant urbanization plague looting also seem survived devastating passage storm daniel killed least people information imprecise present flooding complicated access site major destruction yet recorded reported archaeologist vincent michel constant contact tripoli cyrene antiquities departments necessary carry mission assess exact state site number tombs nevertheless damaged foundations many monuments sanctuary demeter affected torrents mud slabs ancient road linking sanctuary apollo upper town also ripped flow water rushing water carried away great deal earth stone none buildings sanctuary apollo collapsed explained michel consolidated large quantity stagnant water makes fragile ancient city apollonia known thermal baths ancient port appear suffered significant damage coastal sites cyrenaica water attacked site amplified erosion lamented michel time impossible assess extent damage latrun site kilometers apollonia road leading destroyed however situation appears critical derna boasts magnificent mosque monastery seafront among jewels,ruin ancient hellen necropoli cyren largest north africa surviv chao war rampant urban plagu loot also seem surviv devast passag storm daniel kill least peopl inform imprecis present flood complic access site major destruct yet record report archaeologist vincent michel constant contact tripoli cyren antiqu depart necessari carri mission assess exact state site number tomb nevertheless damag foundat mani monument sanctuari demet affect torrent mud slab ancient road link sanctuari apollo upper town also rip flow water rush water carri away great deal earth stone none build sanctuari apollo collaps explain michel consolid larg quantiti stagnant water make fragil ancient citi apollonia known thermal bath ancient port appear suffer signific damag coastal site cyrenaica water attack site amplifi eros lament michel time imposs assess extent damag latrun site kilomet apollonia road lead destroy howev situat appear critic derna boast magnific mosqu monasteri seafront among jewel
Two Russian and one American astronauts dock at the International Space Station,"    In a rare display of international cooperation, Russian and American astronauts lifted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft amid ongoing tensions over Ukraine. ","Two Russian cosmonauts and an American astronaut docked with the International Space Station on Friday, September 15, after blasting off amid raging tensions between Moscow and Washington over Ukraine.Earlier Friday Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub and NASA astronaut Loral O'Hara lifted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft. The crew docked at the ISS three hours later, the Russian space agency said. At the orbiting station, the trio will join three Russians, two Americans, a Japanese astronaut and a representative of the European Space Agency.The liftoff took place after Russia's first lunar mission in nearly 50 years failed last month. The ISS is a rare venue for cooperation between the United States and Russia, whose ties broke down after Moscow unleashed its offensive in Ukraine last year.Kononenko alluded to the tensions during a pre-flight press conference on Thursday, saying that ""unlike on earth"" cosmonauts and astronauts took care of each other in space. ""We hear each other there, and we understand each other, and we are very sensitive to our relationships,"" he said. ""We always take care of each other.""O'Hara praised the station's ""legacy"" and said it had been bringing the countries together. ""I'm excited to get on board and see the crewmates who are waiting for us,"" she added. Kononenko, 59, and Chub, 39, were scheduled to spend a year on the ISS, while O'Hara, 40, was to spend six months aboard. It was the first mission to space for both O'Hara and Chub. Chub said that travelling to space was his ""childhood dream"" and he had dedicated ""all his life"" to reaching that goal.The three take over from Russians Dmitry Petelin and Sergey Prokopyev, as well as NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, who have spent one year aboard the ISS. While that trio was initially supposed to return in March, their mission had to be extended after their vessel, the Soyuz MS-22, suffered a coolant leak following damage from a suspected tiny meteoroid. They will now return to Earth on the MS-23, according to Roscosmos.Russian President Vladimir Putin is looking to strengthen space cooperation with China as Western condemnation and sanctions over Moscow's offensive in Ukraine intensify. On Wednesday, Putin hosted the reclusive leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, at the new Vostochny spaceport in Russia's Far East region, and the two discussed the possibility of sending a North Korean into space.Last month, Russia's Luna-25 module crashed on the Moon's surface after an incident during pre-landing manoeuvres, in a huge embarrassment for Moscow. The mission was meant to mark Russia's return to independent lunar exploration in the face of financial troubles and corruption scandals, and its growing isolation from the West. Moscow last landed a probe on the Moon in 1976, before shifting away from lunar exploration in favour of missions to Venus and building the Mir space station.",Science,two russian cosmonauts american astronaut docked international space station friday september blasting amid raging tensions moscow washington ukraine earlier friday roscosmos cosmonauts oleg kononenko nikolai chub nasa astronaut loral ohara lifted baikonur cosmodrome kazakhstan aboard soyuz spacecraft crew docked iss three hours later russian space agency said orbiting station trio join three russians two americans japanese astronaut representative european space agency liftoff took place russias first lunar mission nearly years failed last month iss rare venue cooperation united states russia whose ties broke moscow unleashed offensive ukraine last year kononenko alluded tensions pre flight press conference thursday saying unlike earth cosmonauts astronauts took care space hear understand sensitive relationships said always take care ohara praised stations legacy said bringing countries together excited get board see crewmates waiting added kononenko chub scheduled spend year iss ohara spend six months aboard first mission space ohara chub chub said travelling space childhood dream dedicated life reaching goal three take russians dmitry petelin sergey prokopyev well nasa astronaut frank rubio spent one year aboard iss trio initially supposed return march mission extended vessel soyuz suffered coolant leak following damage suspected tiny meteoroid return earth according roscosmos russian president vladimir putin looking strengthen space cooperation china western condemnation sanctions moscows offensive ukraine intensify wednesday putin hosted reclusive leader north korea kim jong new vostochny spaceport russias far east region two discussed possibility sending north korean space last month russias luna module crashed moons surface incident pre landing manoeuvres huge embarrassment moscow mission meant mark russias return independent lunar exploration face financial troubles corruption scandals growing isolation west moscow last landed probe moon shifting away lunar exploration favour missions venus building mir space station,two russian cosmonaut american astronaut dock intern space station friday septemb blast amid rage tension moscow washington ukrain earlier friday roscosmo cosmonaut oleg kononenko nikolai chub nasa astronaut loral ohara lift baikonur cosmodrom kazakhstan aboard soyuz spacecraft crew dock iss three hour later russian space agenc said orbit station trio join three russian two american japanes astronaut repres european space agenc liftoff took place russia first lunar mission nearli year fail last month iss rare venu cooper unit state russia whose tie broke moscow unleash offens ukrain last year kononenko allud tension pre flight press confer thursday say unlik earth cosmonaut astronaut took care space hear understand sensit relationship said alway take care ohara prais station legaci said bring countri togeth excit get board see crewmat wait ad kononenko chub schedul spend year iss ohara spend six month aboard first mission space ohara chub chub said travel space childhood dream dedic life reach goal three take russian dmitri petelin sergey prokopyev well nasa astronaut frank rubio spent one year aboard iss trio initi suppos return march mission extend vessel soyuz suffer coolant leak follow damag suspect tini meteoroid return earth accord roscosmo russian presid vladimir putin look strengthen space cooper china western condemn sanction moscow offens ukrain intensifi wednesday putin host reclus leader north korea kim jong new vostochni spaceport russia far east region two discuss possibl send north korean space last month russia luna modul crash moon surfac incid pre land manoeuvr huge embarrass moscow mission meant mark russia return independ lunar explor face financi troubl corrupt scandal grow isol west moscow last land probe moon shift away lunar explor favour mission venu build mir space station
The world's renewed interest in lunar exploration,"India, China, Japan and Russia have all set their sights on the Earth's satellite, symbolizing a spirit of conquest. Reaching its orbit or surface is synonymous with modernity, advanced technology and even national prestige.","Three times this summer, the Moon was the object of a spatial mission. On August 19, Russia's Luna-25 lander experienced an anomaly during its final descent and crashed into the surface of our satellite. This failure prevented Moscow from reconnecting with its distant and glorious past (in 1976, the Soviet probe Luna-24 brought back samples of lunar soil) and cruelly illustrated the loss of Russian space know-how in exploration missions. On August 23, India became the fourth nation to land on the Moon with its Chandrayaan-3 mission. Finally, on September 7, Japan launched its SLIM probe which, if all goes well, will make it the fifth country to land on the lunar surface.Even though each of these three missions was modest in scope, together they are significant. They follow the major programs being conducted by the world's two leading powers. The United States is leading the Artemis program (in which the European, Canadian and Japanese space agencies are also participating), which aims to send humans back to the Moon in a few years' time. China, since 2007, has conscientiously completed successive stages of its Chang'e project, with successes such as the first rover on the far side of the Moon in 2019 and a sample return the following year. Beijing has made no secret of its ambition to send astronauts to the Moon by 2030, and even to set up a permanent base there.Why this renewed interest in lunar exploration, which had been neglected after the end of the Apollo program in 1972? There are many reasons, but as demonstrated by the pride evident in India after the successful landing of Chandrayaan-3, national prestige is not to be overlooked. There is also the desire to belong to the elite club of great space powers, synonymous with modernity and advanced technology. The Moon symbolizes a spirit of conquest, and it's hardly surprising that Narendra Modi, Xi Jinping and Donald Trump (who launched the Artemis program during his presidency) are all enthusiastic about it.On the other hand, it would be misleading to compare the Moon race of the 1960s to our times, replacing the USSR of yesteryear with China. With the Artemis and Chang'e programs, neither Washington nor Beijing is seeking to prove to the world the supremacy of its model of society, as was the case during the Cold War. Even though delays may prevent the Americans from walking on the Moon again by December 2025 as they had planned, their mastery of space technology remains far more advanced than that of China. China is still learning, with the declared aim of catching up and methodically reproducing what its Soviet and American predecessors achieved in the 20th century.",Science,three times summer moon object spatial mission august russias luna lander experienced anomaly final descent crashed surface satellite failure prevented moscow reconnecting distant glorious past soviet probe luna brought back samples lunar soil cruelly illustrated loss russian space know exploration missions august india became fourth nation land moon chandrayaan mission finally september japan launched slim probe goes well make fifth country land lunar surface even though three missions modest scope together significant follow major programs conducted worlds two leading powers united states leading artemis program european canadian japanese space agencies also participating aims send humans back moon years time china since conscientiously completed successive stages change project successes first rover far side moon sample return following year beijing made secret ambition send astronauts moon even set permanent base renewed interest lunar exploration neglected end apollo program many reasons demonstrated pride evident india successful landing chandrayaan national prestige overlooked also desire belong elite club great space powers synonymous modernity advanced technology moon symbolizes spirit conquest hardly surprising narendra modi jinping donald trump launched artemis program presidency enthusiastic hand would misleading compare moon race times replacing ussr yesteryear china artemis change programs neither washington beijing seeking prove world supremacy model society case cold war even though delays may prevent americans walking moon december planned mastery space technology remains far advanced china china still learning declared aim catching methodically reproducing soviet american predecessors achieved century,three time summer moon object spatial mission august russia luna lander experienc anomali final descent crash surfac satellit failur prevent moscow reconnect distant gloriou past soviet probe luna brought back sampl lunar soil cruelli illustr loss russian space know explor mission august india becam fourth nation land moon chandrayaan mission final septemb japan launch slim probe goe well make fifth countri land lunar surfac even though three mission modest scope togeth signific follow major program conduct world two lead power unit state lead artemi program european canadian japanes space agenc also particip aim send human back moon year time china sinc conscienti complet success stage chang project success first rover far side moon sampl return follow year beij made secret ambit send astronaut moon even set perman base renew interest lunar explor neglect end apollo program mani reason demonstr pride evid india success land chandrayaan nation prestig overlook also desir belong elit club great space power synonym modern advanc technolog moon symbol spirit conquest hardli surpris narendra modi jinp donald trump launch artemi program presid enthusiast hand would mislead compar moon race time replac ussr yesteryear china artemi chang program neither washington beij seek prove world supremaci model societi case cold war even though delay may prevent american walk moon decemb plan masteri space technolog remain far advanc china china still learn declar aim catch method reproduc soviet american predecessor achiev centuri
Precise prehistoric engravings discovered in Namibia,"    Numerous representations of human and animal figures and footprints have been found in the Doro Nawas Mountains in Namibia, dating back to between 5,000 and 1,000 BC. ","Created by African hunter-gatherers between 5,000 and 1,000 BC, numerous engravings have been found in the Doro Nawas Mountains in Namibia, featuring human and animal silhouettes. Footprints and animal tracks also feature prominently. In a study published on Wednesday, September 13, by PLOS One, three German archaeologists had enlisted the help of native trackers to try to identify the species from footprints that were drawn.

US opioid crisis: 'Overdoses are among the leading causes of death in several age categories',"    Epidemiologist Chelsea Shover discusses a new report about the recent findings on the opioid scourge that's ravaging the United States, more than two decades after the first wave of opioid deaths. ","The United States is sinking deeper into an opioid crisis. With some 120,000 overdose deaths predicted for 2023, the next wave seems likely to reach an unprecedented level. It's the ""fourth wave,"" in fact, pointed out epidemiologist Chelsea Shover, from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In an article published on Thursday, September 14, with her colleague Joseph Friedman in the journal Addiction, she describes its distinct characteristics.Forgive me for stating the obvious, but it comes after three other waves. The first developed in the late 1990s, fueled by the overprescription and misuse of legal opioids to treat pain. From 2010 onwards, we saw a significant increase in heroin overdose deaths among people previously dependent on opioid drugs. A few years later, around 2013, fentanyl began to take control of the illegal drug supply, with a further increase in the number of deaths across much of the US. Finally, in 2015, we began to observe that more and more deaths were occurring related to a combination of this synthetic opioid and other substances, mainly so-called stimulant drugs, cocaine and methamphetamine. What we are calling the fourth wave is unprecedented: In 2015, there were around 50,000 fatal overdoses. In 2022, the figures exceeded 110,000 deaths, and will probably be 120,000 in 2023.By a massive increase in the prescription of opioids for pain relief. This practice began to spread in the 1990s and early 2000s, reaching its peak in the 2010s. As awareness grew, health authorities took steps to limit prescriptions. But it was too late, the addicted population was too large. Heroin market forces also came into play and consumption shifted.For many users, the over-consumption of medicines was already based on illegal channels. They used painkillers bought by others: family, friends, but also people who resold them on the black market. Heroin was cheaper, and in some cases more available, as the conditions for issuing prescriptions had become stricter. The transition from one to the other, for people who were dependent and often desperate to satisfy their need for drugs, was fairly straightforward. As prescribing started to decrease, the supply of prescription opioids began drying up and heroin came in as a cheaper alternative, then fentanyl.",Science,united states sinking deeper opioid crisis overdose deaths predicted next wave seems likely reach unprecedented level fourth wave fact pointed epidemiologist chelsea shover university california los angeles ucla article published thursday september colleague joseph friedman journal addiction describes distinct characteristics forgive stating obvious comes three waves first developed late fueled overprescription misuse legal opioids treat pain onwards saw significant increase heroin overdose deaths among people previously dependent opioid drugs years later around fentanyl began take control illegal drug supply increase number deaths across much finally began observe deaths occurring related combination synthetic opioid substances mainly called stimulant drugs cocaine methamphetamine calling fourth wave unprecedented around fatal overdoses figures exceeded deaths probably massive increase prescription opioids pain relief practice began spread early reaching peak awareness grew health authorities took steps limit prescriptions late addicted population large heroin market forces also came play consumption shifted many users consumption medicines already based illegal channels used painkillers bought others family friends also people resold black market heroin cheaper cases available conditions issuing prescriptions become stricter transition one people dependent often desperate satisfy need drugs fairly straightforward prescribing started decrease supply prescription opioids began drying heroin came cheaper alternative fentanyl,unit state sink deeper opioid crisi overdos death predict next wave seem like reach unpreced level fourth wave fact point epidemiologist chelsea shover univers california lo angel ucla articl publish thursday septemb colleagu joseph friedman journal addict describ distinct characterist forgiv state obviou come three wave first develop late fuel overprescript misus legal opioid treat pain onward saw signific increas heroin overdos death among peopl previous depend opioid drug year later around fentanyl began take control illeg drug suppli increas number death across much final began observ death occur relat combin synthet opioid substanc mainli call stimul drug cocain methamphetamin call fourth wave unpreced around fatal overdos figur exceed death probabl massiv increas prescript opioid pain relief practic began spread earli reach peak awar grew health author took step limit prescript late addict popul larg heroin market forc also came play consumpt shift mani user consumpt medicin alreadi base illeg channel use painkil bought other famili friend also peopl resold black market heroin cheaper case avail condit issu prescript becom stricter transit one peopl depend often desper satisfi need drug fairli straightforward prescrib start decreas suppli prescript opioid began dri heroin came cheaper altern fentanyl
Oysters use epigenetics to fight viruses,"Attacked since 2008 by a powerful pathogen, the mollusc has found a quick defense mechanism: it modifies certain genes and, above all, their activity.","Oyster enthusiasts are a fairly widespread species. Willing to travel hundreds of kilometers to enjoy a coastal platter, they place the mollusc above all else. Some will quote La Fontaine or Lewis Carroll, while others will tell you that ancient Athenians used shellfish to vote, giving rise to the verb ""to ostracize."" Above all, they are generally experts on everything to do with the cultivation and consumption of Crassostrea gigas, the Japanese oyster, better known as the Pacific oyster.Of the 66 or so known species, the Pacific oyster alone accounts for 98% of the 130,000 metric tons produced each year on the French coast. That's a far cry from the 3.7 million metric tons farmed by the Chinese, but it still represents 90% of European production. Why a Japanese oyster on the Atlantic coast? Quite simply because, after centuries of uneventful consumption, the flat oyster was decimated by a pathogen in the 1930s. Producers then turned to the Portuguese oyster, which in turn succumbed to infection in the 1970s. This time, oyster farmers went as far as the Far East to find a resistant mollusc. But, once again, this sought-after solution came under attack. Dubbed POMS (Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome), this viral disease first appeared in the early 2000s. At first, it remained discreet. But in 2008, a new variant turned this little nuisance into a serial killer, wiping out 40% to 100% of affected larvae.Scientists then set to work. First, they realized that the herpes virus in question was attacking the bivalve's immune system, leaving it defenseless against opportunistic infections. They then studied this lethal phenomenon to try and understand how certain individuals, often entire colonies, managed to resist it. In an article published on Friday, September 8, in Science Advances, a team from the Host-Pathogen-Environment Interactions (IHPE) laboratory in Montpellier provided the answer: Resistant molluscs underwent ""rapid adaptation"" thanks to a few appropriate genetic mutations and, above all, epigenetic changes.For seafood lovers unfamiliar with the intricacies of molecular biology, it's worth noting that epigenetics isn't concerned with the genetic code and the nature of the proteins it synthesizes, but with the activity of genes, their ""expression,"" which can be strengthened or weakened by certain small chemical additions to the DNA. ""Our study has highlighted the crucial importance of these epigenetic modifications, sometimes in conjunction with genetic mutations, but sometimes in the absence of any mutation at all,"" emphasized Jérémie Vidal-Dupiol, researcher at the Institut Français de Recherche pour l’Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER, state-run oceanographic institution) and coordinator of the study.",Science,oyster enthusiasts fairly widespread species willing travel hundreds kilometers enjoy coastal platter place mollusc else quote fontaine lewis carroll others tell ancient athenians used shellfish vote giving rise verb ostracize generally experts everything cultivation consumption crassostrea gigas japanese oyster better known pacific oyster known species pacific oyster alone accounts metric tons produced year french coast thats far cry million metric tons farmed chinese still represents european production japanese oyster atlantic coast quite simply centuries uneventful consumption flat oyster decimated pathogen producers turned portuguese oyster turn succumbed infection time oyster farmers went far far east find resistant mollusc sought solution came attack dubbed poms pacific oyster mortality syndrome viral disease first appeared early first remained discreet new variant turned little nuisance serial killer wiping affected larvae scientists set work first realized herpes virus question attacking bivalves immune system leaving defenseless opportunistic infections studied lethal phenomenon try understand certain individuals often entire colonies managed resist article published friday september science advances team host pathogen environment interactions ihpe laboratory montpellier provided answer resistant molluscs underwent rapid adaptation thanks appropriate genetic mutations epigenetic changes seafood lovers unfamiliar intricacies molecular biology worth noting epigenetics isnt concerned genetic code nature proteins synthesizes activity genes expression strengthened weakened certain small chemical additions dna study highlighted crucial importance epigenetic modifications sometimes conjunction genetic mutations sometimes absence mutation emphasized mie vidal dupiol researcher institut fran ais recherche pour exploitation mer ifremer state run oceanographic institution coordinator study,oyster enthusiast fairli widespread speci will travel hundr kilomet enjoy coastal platter place mollusc els quot fontain lewi carrol other tell ancient athenian use shellfish vote give rise verb ostrac gener expert everyth cultiv consumpt crassostrea giga japanes oyster better known pacif oyster known speci pacif oyster alon account metric ton produc year french coast that far cri million metric ton farm chines still repres european product japanes oyster atlant coast quit simpli centuri unev consumpt flat oyster decim pathogen produc turn portugues oyster turn succumb infect time oyster farmer went far far east find resist mollusc sought solut came attack dub pom pacif oyster mortal syndrom viral diseas first appear earli first remain discreet new variant turn littl nuisanc serial killer wipe affect larva scientist set work first realiz herp viru question attack bivalv immun system leav defenseless opportunist infect studi lethal phenomenon tri understand certain individu often entir coloni manag resist articl publish friday septemb scienc advanc team host pathogen environ interact ihp laboratori montpelli provid answer resist mollusc underw rapid adapt thank appropri genet mutat epigenet chang seafood lover unfamiliar intricaci molecular biolog worth note epigenet isnt concern genet code natur protein synthes activ gene express strengthen weaken certain small chemic addit dna studi highlight crucial import epigenet modif sometim conjunct genet mutat sometim absenc mutat emphas mie vidal dupiol research institut fran ai recherch pour exploit mer ifrem state run oceanograph institut coordin studi
NASA's Osiris-Rex capsule brings asteroid samples back to Earth,"    NASA's mission came to an end in the Utah desert, where a capsule containing 250 grams of samples collected from the asteroid Bennu landed on Sunday. ","Covering over 6 billion kilometers in space during its seven-year voyage, Osiris-Rex closely followed and examined the Bennu asteroid, collecting 250 grams of samples from it back in 2020. On Sunday, September 24, NASA's spacecraft flew by Earth in order to release a small capsule containing its precious cargo, which landed shortly before 5 pm (Paris time) in a vast 9,300 km2 military zone in the Utah desert.It was a critical maneuver, involving the smooth landing of an object originally traveling at 44,500 km/h. It all began at 12:42 pm, when Osiris-Rex, then just over 100,000 km above Earth, released the 50-kilogram capsule into space. Four hours later, it began its entry into Earth's atmosphere. Friction with the air raised the temperature of its protective shield to around 2,800°C.At an altitude of 31 km, a first parachute, 80 cm in diameter, sprang from the back of the capsule to stabilize it. A few minutes later, a second parachute, 7.3 m in diameter, took over for the final 1,500 m of descent. The entire journey was monitored by radar and cameras to help the recovery team find the capsule. The final destination for the sample will be the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, home to NASA's division in charge of foreign materials, such as moon rocks from the Apollo missions, solar wind particles and meteorites.Samples taken from asteroids are invaluable to astronomers. As Patrick Michel, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) at the Côte d'Azur Observatory and member of the Osiris-Rex scientific team, explained to Le Monde in 2019, ""asteroids are the remains of the bricks that built the planets."" In other words, they are remnants of the formation of the solar system. Unlike planets, which have undergone extensive heating and chemical metamorphosis, asteroids are only slightly transformed, preserving in a way the memory of these primitive bricks.Although not the first in situ sample of its kind, the Osiris-Rex shipment is likely to be the largest ever reported. The very first attempt, led by Japan with the Hayabusa spacecraft, ended in semi-failure. Due to a series of problems, only 1,500 microscopic grains from the Itokawa asteroid were returned to Earth in 2010. On the other hand, its ""daughter mission"" Hayabusa2 was a complete success, collecting just over five grams of material from the asteroid Ryugu. Far more than its initial target of a fraction of a gram, but far less than Osiris-Rex's estimated 250 grams. Not all of the material will be handed over to the researchers: 70% of the sample will be saved for later, until analytical techniques have progressed.",Science,covering billion kilometers space seven year voyage osiris rex closely followed examined bennu asteroid collecting grams samples back sunday september nasas spacecraft flew earth order release small capsule containing precious cargo landed shortly paris time vast military zone utah desert critical maneuver involving smooth landing object originally traveling began osiris rex earth released kilogram capsule space four hours later began entry earths atmosphere friction air raised temperature protective shield around altitude first parachute diameter sprang back capsule stabilize minutes later second parachute diameter took final descent entire journey monitored radar cameras help recovery team find capsule final destination sample lyndon johnson space center houston texas home nasas division charge foreign materials moon rocks apollo missions solar wind particles meteorites samples taken asteroids invaluable astronomers patrick michel research director french national center scientific research cnrs dazur observatory member osiris rex scientific team explained monde asteroids remains bricks built planets words remnants formation solar system unlike planets undergone extensive heating chemical metamorphosis asteroids slightly transformed preserving way memory primitive bricks although first situ sample kind osiris rex shipment likely largest ever reported first attempt led japan hayabusa spacecraft ended semi failure due series problems microsco itokawa asteroid returned earth hand daughter mission hayabusa complete success collecting five grams material asteroid ryugu far initial target fraction gram far less osiris rexs estimated grams material handed researchers sample saved later analytical techniques progressed,cover billion kilomet space seven year voyag osiri rex close follow examin bennu asteroid collect gram sampl back sunday septemb nasa spacecraft flew earth order releas small capsul contain preciou cargo land shortli pari time vast militari zone utah desert critic maneuv involv smooth land object origin travel began osiri rex earth releas kilogram capsul space four hour later began entri earth atmospher friction air rais temperatur protect shield around altitud first parachut diamet sprang back capsul stabil minut later second parachut diamet took final descent entir journey monitor radar camera help recoveri team find capsul final destin sampl lyndon johnson space center houston texa home nasa divis charg foreign materi moon rock apollo mission solar wind particl meteorit sampl taken asteroid invalu astronom patrick michel research director french nation center scientif research cnr dazur observatori member osiri rex scientif team explain mond asteroid remain brick built planet word remnant format solar system unlik planet undergon extens heat chemic metamorphosi asteroid slightli transform preserv way memori primit brick although first situ sampl kind osiri rex shipment like largest ever report first attempt led japan hayabusa spacecraft end semi failur due seri problem microsco itokawa asteroid return earth hand daughter mission hayabusa complet success collect five gram materi asteroid ryugu far initi target fraction gram far less osiri rex estim gram materi hand research sampl save later analyt techniqu progress
French scientists call for 'the implementation of a Manhattan Project for environmental transition',"A group, including Nobel Prize-winning physicist Alain Aspect and biologist Eric Karsenti, argue for the creation of a research center linked to the industry sector, similar to the American investment to develop the first atomic bomb.","Christopher Nolan's recent biographical film Oppenheimer reminded us that, in the face of a global emergency, humankind is capable of incredibly swift and effective collective action – however fateful its purpose. Five years after its inception, the Manhattan Project [which produced the first atomic bomb] was an unprecedented technical achievement. It embraced the most advanced science of the time and achieved its industrialization on a massive scale, involving over 130,000 men and women, from research laboratories to refining plants.And if humankind is capable of such feats of destruction, it can be just as capable of the common good in times of peace. At a time of never-ending climate disasters – fires, floods, heatwaves, droughts... – it is now undeniable that global warming is an existential threat. Limiting the warming and adapting to it is an imperative and overriding duty: the greatest challenge in human history. In agriculture, industry and transport, fossil fuels form the very basis of modern industrial society. Doing without them implies a new collective organization and, in particular, a profound transformation of our technical and industrial tools. Decarbonizing the energy, physical, chemical and agricultural processes that underpin the industrialized world in order to avoid millions of deaths: This is our historic responsibility.Yet the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned us: 40% of the technologies needed for environmental transition are not at a sufficient level of maturity. The agency gives the example of seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production, sodium batteries, CO2 capture or conversion, and heat storage. Unfortunately, far from contributing to the transition, many of these ""strategic technologies"" are still at the stage of laboratory experiments carried out by a few scientists with modest means.Despite the urgency, the transition has in fact not begun: Emissions continue to rise. We are failing and we are condemning our children. To meet this urgent challenge, we need to combine rapid scientific advances with massive industrial transformation. We, scientists from all backgrounds, are calling for the implementation of a Manhattan Project for environmental transition. France, and more broadly Europe, can make it happen.We are calling for the creation of a research and innovation center, tasked with developing the scientific and technological tools for the transition, in direct liaison with industry. Like CERN, the European organization for nuclear research, it will collaborate with the entire international academic and industrial fabric, including emerging and less advanced countries, and act as an open scientific and technological hub. This hub will bring together the best scientists and engineers with the means to move fast. In particular, all research will be directed towards the development of decarbonized processes and their rapid deployment on a large scale, moving them from the laboratory to industries capable of implementing the transition. In order to meet the COP21 objectives of carbon neutrality by 2050, we expect the project to have a lifespan of 25 years.",Science,christopher nolans recent biographical film oppenheimer reminded face global emergency humankind capable incredibly swift effective collective action however fateful purpose five years inception manhattan project produced first atomic bomb unprecedented technical achievement embraced advanced science time achieved industrialization massive scale involving men women research laboratories refining plants humankind capable feats destruction capable common good times peace time never ending climate disasters fires floods heatwaves droughts undeniable global warming existential threat limiting warming adapting imperative overriding duty greatest challenge human history agriculture industry transport fossil fuels form basis modern industrial society without implies new collective organization particular profound transformation technical industrial tools decarbonizing energy physical chemical agricultural processes underpin industrialized world order avoid millions deaths historic responsibility yet international energy agency iea warned technologies needed environmental transition sufficient level maturity agency gives example seawater electrolysis hydrogen production sodium batteries capture conversion heat storage unfortunately far contributing transition many strategic technologies still stage laboratory experiments carried scientists modest means despite urgency transition fact begun emissions continue rise failing condemning children meet urgent challenge need combine rapid scientific advances massive industrial transformation scientists backgrounds calling implementation manhattan project environmental transition france broadly europe make happen calling creation research innovation center tasked developing scientific technological tools transition direct liaison industry like cern european organization nuclear research collaborate entire international academic industrial fabric including emerging less advanced countries act open scientific technological hub hub bring together best scientists engineers means move fast particular research directed towards development decarbonized processes rapid deployment large scale moving laboratory industries capable implementing transition order meet cop objectives carbon neutrality expect project lifespan years,christoph nolan recent biograph film oppenheim remind face global emerg humankind capabl incred swift effect collect action howev fate purpos five year incept manhattan project produc first atom bomb unpreced technic achiev embrac advanc scienc time achiev industri massiv scale involv men women research laboratori refin plant humankind capabl feat destruct capabl common good time peac time never end climat disast fire flood heatwav drought undeni global warm existenti threat limit warm adapt imper overrid duti greatest challeng human histori agricultur industri transport fossil fuel form basi modern industri societi without impli new collect organ particular profound transform technic industri tool decarbon energi physic chemic agricultur process underpin industri world order avoid million death histor respons yet intern energi agenc iea warn technolog need environment transit suffici level matur agenc give exampl seawat electrolysi hydrogen product sodium batteri captur convers heat storag unfortun far contribut transit mani strateg technolog still stage laboratori experi carri scientist modest mean despit urgenc transit fact begun emiss continu rise fail condemn children meet urgent challeng need combin rapid scientif advanc massiv industri transform scientist background call implement manhattan project environment transit franc broadli europ make happen call creation research innov center task develop scientif technolog tool transit direct liaison industri like cern european organ nuclear research collabor entir intern academ industri fabric includ emerg less advanc countri act open scientif technolog hub hub bring togeth best scientist engin mean move fast particular research direct toward develop decarbon process rapid deploy larg scale move laboratori industri capabl implement transit order meet cop object carbon neutral expect project lifespan year
The Tasmanian tiger reveals its RNA,"    The thylacine, whose last specimen became extinct in 1936, is the first extinct species from which researchers have been able to recover ribonucleic acid (RNA), which translates into proteins and regulates the information carried by DNA. ","Determined to be the first to extract ribonucleic acid (RNA) from an extinct species, Emilio Marmol Sanchez with the Stockholm Paleogenetic Center and his colleagues naturally turned to the thylacine, or the Tasmanian tiger. ""It constitutes a famous example of recent human-caused extinction. The last known individual died in 1936 at Hobart Zoo,"" he said. On September 21, in the Genome Research journal, the Swedish team presented the results of their work.The aim was to prove that RNA, which is much more fragile than DNA, can also be recovered to shed light on the evolution of species that now only exist as specimens in collections. Why search for this molecule? It performs numerous functions within cells, including translation into proteins and regulation of the information carried by DNA. While the different tissues of an organism carry identical DNA, it is the activity profile of RNA that provides their specificity, and which could therefore provide more detailed information on their physiology.Recent years have seen the development of paleotranscriptomics, the science of studying ancient RNA, as a complement to paleogenomics (the search for ancient DNA, such as Neanderthal DNA) or paleoproteomics (proteins encoded from DNA). The RNA of Otzi, the famous, over 5,000-year-old ""ice man"" was recovered in 2017, along with molecules from dogs and wolves.Sanchez and his colleagues set their sights on the thylacine, the largest of the carnivorous marsupials, a specimen of which had been preserved in the Stockholm Museum since the 1890s. From muscle and skin samples, RNA sequences were successfully multiplied using PCR technology (the same used in some tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2, an RNA virus) and sequenced. However, the researchers had to ensure that the amplified RNA did not come from contamination by microbes, fungi, other animals stored in the stockpile, or humans.This is where work carried out on the other side of the world proved particularly useful. Andrew Pask and his team at the University of Melbourne proposed a first draft of the Tasmanian tiger genome in 2018, before publishing a more refined version in 2022. As DNA and RNA are complementary, the alignment of their sequences makes it possible to determine their origin by comparison. ""Our study greatly benefited from this reference genome,"" said Sanchez, adding that the sequencing of the Tasmanian devil, an endangered marsupial species related to the thylacine, was also very useful for sorting through the RNA soup.",Science,determined first extract ribonucleic acid rna extinct species emilio marmol sanchez stockholm paleogenetic center colleagues naturally turned thylacine tasmanian tiger constitutes famous example recent human caused extinction last known individual died hobart zoo said september genome research journal swedish team presented results work aim prove rna much fragile dna also recovered shed light evolution species exist specimens collections search molecule performs numerous functions within cells including translation proteins regulation information carried dna different tissues organism carry identical dna activity profile rna provides specificity could therefore provide detailed information physiology recent years seen development paleotranscriptomics science studying ancient rna complement paleogenomics search ancient dna neanderthal dna paleoproteomics proteins encoded dna rna otzi famous year old ice man recovered along molecules dogs wolves sanchez colleagues set sights thylacine largest carnivorous marsupials specimen preserved stockholm museum since muscle skin samples rna sequences successfully multiplied using pcr technology used tests detect presence sars cov rna virus sequenced however researchers ensure amplified rna come contamination microbes fungi animals stored stockpile humans work carried side world proved particularly useful andrew pask team university melbourne proposed first draft tasmanian tiger genome publishing refined version dna rna complementary alignment sequences makes possible determine origin comparison study greatly benefited reference genome said sanchez adding sequencing tasmanian devil endangered marsupial species related thylacine also useful sorting rna soup,determin first extract ribonucl acid rna extinct speci emilio marmol sanchez stockholm paleogenet center colleagu natur turn thylacin tasmanian tiger constitut famou exampl recent human caus extinct last known individu die hobart zoo said septemb genom research journal swedish team present result work aim prove rna much fragil dna also recov shed light evolut speci exist specimen collect search molecul perform numer function within cell includ translat protein regul inform carri dna differ tissu organ carri ident dna activ profil rna provid specif could therefor provid detail inform physiolog recent year seen develop paleotranscriptom scienc studi ancient rna complement paleogenom search ancient dna neanderth dna paleoproteom protein encod dna rna otzi famou year old ice man recov along molecul dog wolv sanchez colleagu set sight thylacin largest carnivor marsupi specimen preserv stockholm museum sinc muscl skin sampl rna sequenc success multipli use pcr technolog use test detect presenc sar cov rna viru sequenc howev research ensur amplifi rna come contamin microb fungi anim store stockpil human work carri side world prove particularli use andrew pask team univers melbourn propos first draft tasmanian tiger genom publish refin version dna rna complementari align sequenc make possibl determin origin comparison studi greatli benefit refer genom said sanchez ad sequenc tasmanian devil endang marsupi speci relat thylacin also use sort rna soup
"Spiders, sentinels of mercury pollution","Tetragnatha spiders feed on aquatic insects, reinjecting this heavy metal into the terrestrial food chain. They also tell us about its origin.","Mercury is a terrible poison. A ""global pollutant,"" according to scientists, because it is found all over the world. It's dreaded because it follows a convoluted path. It is found on land, but it reaches its full toxicity when transformed into methylmercury by aquatic bacteria in water. It then accumulates in all water creatures, from insects to fish. For humans, it can be harmful, particularly to the unborn. So much so that the World Health Organization has classified it as one of the 10 pollutants of greatest concern. Even though its use has been considerably reduced, gold mining, consumption of fossil fuels (particularly coal) and old industrial waste continue to pollute rivers, lakes and oceans. The European Environment Agency estimates that mercury levels in the seas are three times higher than they should be. It's worse in some lakes.Spiders of the genus Tetragnatha have a front-row seat to this sad spectacle. They even play a role in it – a secondary role, for the time being, but one that could grow, according to an article published on Wednesday, September 13, in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters. As scientists from the US Geological Survey (USGS) have pointed out, these creatures feed exclusively on aquatic insects and are eaten by frogs, snakes and birds. They therefore contribute to reinjecting the pollutant into the terrestrial food chain.Should we get rid of them? ""Certainly not,"" insisted Sarah Janssen, the principal author of the publication. ""Otters and muskrats also feed in water. Tadpoles grow up in the river and then, as frogs, emerge from it. Aquatic insects reproduce on land. They too contribute to the transfer."" Understand from this that we're not going to eradicate them all.Tetragnathes also have a trump card: They're true sentinels. They see all, and conserve all. In fact, the various sources of mercury (natural, combustion, waste) each present a particular balance between different isotopes. By analyzing the insects, fish and spiders in two tributaries of North America's immense Lake Superior, USGS researchers have shown, for the first time, that the latter retain the signature already observed in the first two.There's no contest between dragonflies, perch and spiders [for research purposes], underlined the scientists. Firstly, the spider not only provides information on aquatic pollution but also shows how mercury is transferred to the terrestrial environment. That's not all, said research coordinator David Walters. ""They're much easier to catch – you don't need any equipment other than a flashlight,"" he stated. ""They're also much more stationary, unlike fish, which are constantly on the move. So, they offer incomparable spatial information. Finally, Tetragnathes are found almost everywhere there's fresh water. So, they'll allow worldwide comparisons to be made.""",Science,mercury terrible poison global pollutant according scientists found world dreaded follows convoluted path found land reaches full toxicity transformed methylmercury aquatic bacteria water accumulates water creatures insects fish humans harmful particularly unborn much world health organization classified one pollutants greatest concern even though use considerably reduced gold mining consumption fossil fuels particularly coal old industrial waste continue pollute rivers lakes oceans european environment agency estimates mercury levels seas three times higher worse lakes spiders genus tetragnatha front row seat sad spectacle even play role secondary role time one could grow according article published wednesday september journal environmental science technology letters scientists geological survey usgs pointed creatures feed exclusively aquatic insects eaten frogs snakes birds therefore contribute reinjecting pollutant terrestrial food chain get rid certainly insisted sarah janssen principal author publication otters muskrats also feed water tadpoles grow river frogs emerge aquatic insects reproduce land contribute transfer understand going eradicate tetragnathes also trump card theyre true sentinels see conserve fact various sources mercury natural combustion waste present particular balance different isotopes analyzing insects fish spiders two tributaries north americas immense lake superior usgs researchers shown first time latter retain signature already observed first two theres contest dragonflies perch spiders research purposes underlined scientists firstly spider provides information aquatic pollution also shows mercury transferred terrestrial environment thats said research coordinator david walters theyre much easier catch dont need equipment flashlight stated theyre also much stationary unlike fish constantly move offer incomparable spatial information finally tetragnathes found almost everywhere theres fresh water theyll allow worldwide comparisons made,mercuri terribl poison global pollut accord scientist found world dread follow convolut path found land reach full toxic transform methylmercuri aquat bacteria water accumul water creatur insect fish human harm particularli unborn much world health organ classifi one pollut greatest concern even though use consider reduc gold mine consumpt fossil fuel particularli coal old industri wast continu pollut river lake ocean european environ agenc estim mercuri level sea three time higher wors lake spider genu tetragnatha front row seat sad spectacl even play role secondari role time one could grow accord articl publish wednesday septemb journal environment scienc technolog letter scientist geolog survey usg point creatur feed exclus aquat insect eaten frog snake bird therefor contribut reinject pollut terrestri food chain get rid certainli insist sarah janssen princip author public otter muskrat also feed water tadpol grow river frog emerg aquat insect reproduc land contribut transfer understand go erad tetragnath also trump card theyr true sentinel see conserv fact variou sourc mercuri natur combust wast present particular balanc differ isotop analyz insect fish spider two tributari north america immens lake superior usg research shown first time latter retain signatur alreadi observ first two there contest dragonfli perch spider research purpos underlin scientist firstli spider provid inform aquat pollut also show mercuri transfer terrestri environ that said research coordin david walter theyr much easier catch dont need equip flashlight state theyr also much stationari unlik fish constantli move offer incompar spatial inform final tetragnath found almost everywher there fresh water theyll allow worldwid comparison made
"'Fossils have become the foundations of a wide variety of beliefs, from Taiwan to Normandy'","    Paleontologist Éric Buffetaut explores the numerous myths and legends associated with fossils since prehistoric times. Some still endow them with healing properties, while others use them to 'ward off celestial dangers.' ","Fossils are more than just geological curiosities. Since prehistoric times, these remains of living beings preserved within the rocks of the earth's crust have been the subject of various beliefs, legends and superstitions, which have until now been largely overlooked by research in France. Paleontologist Éric Buffetaut, an emeritus director of research at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), aimed to address this by compiling the scattered traces of these myths in his latest book, Fossiles et Croyances Populaires. Une Paléontologie de l'Imaginaire (""Fossils and Popular Beliefs: A Paleontology of the Imaginary"").As a paleontologist, I specialize in vertebrates, and more specifically in dinosaurs and extinct birds. But I've always been interested in popular beliefs, out of curiosity. When I discovered that myths and legends were linked to fossils, it seemed natural to combine my scientific discipline with this personal interest.This project also aligned with a desire to fill a gap specific to France, distinct from Germany, the UK and Central Europe, where there are many books on the subject. In particular, two paleontologists warrant mention: the Austrian specialist Othenio Abel (1875-1946), who published several landmark works in the 1920s and 1930s, and the English paleontologist Kenneth Oakley (1911-1981), who was particularly interested in the symbolic and decorative uses of fossils.Maybe this lack stems from our deeply rooted rationalism, which tends to regard these beliefs as fairy tales. In any case, there are only a few scientific articles, based on the work of paleontologists, archaeologists and folklorists. I have compiled these scattered sources to put together this book, which is the first one to attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of French cases. Beliefs linked to fossils are particularly prominent in the Alps and Normandy, two regions abundant in this subject matter.It cannot be pinpointed exactly when popular beliefs associated with fossils were forged, but it is thought they have attracted human attention as far back as the Palaeolithic period (starting around 3 million years ago and ending 10,000 to 12,000 years ago).

"The demons of Stanislas, Paris's citadel of Catholic education",Investigation,"Last December, the renovated statue of Bayard, the valiant knight, was returned to its place in the courtyard of Collège Stanislas with great applause. More than a sculpture, the private Parisian Catholic school had recovered its guardian figure, whose motto ""without fear and beyond reproach"" inspired the establisment's motto, ""French without fear, Christian beyond reproach"".This symbolic choice dates back to 1872, when the clergy had to close ranks after the shameful defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the Paris Commune, which called for the separation of church and state. Louis De Lagarde, one of the founding fathers of the prestigious establishment on Rue du Montparnasse in the 6th arrondissement, where Edmond Rostand and Charles de Gaulle would study, said at the time: ""I wanted to bring about a fruitful and enduring alliance between France's religious and chivalric traditions. (...) We must prepare young people for a true crusade to safeguard religion, defend truth and uphold the fundamental principles of morality and society.""Over 150 years later, this grandiloquent call still thrills Stanislas, also known as ""Stan"". ""Ah yes, it hasn't changed! I spent three years there and found myself in a time capsule right in the middle of Paris. It's a sort of fairytale world where couples are always a mom and a dad, and where girls and boys would never, ever think of sleeping together before marriage,"" said Cécile, 24, still irritated by a place she describes as ""wrong about everything."" Frédéric Gautier, the director, seems almost amused by this kind of diatribe launched against the institution he has been proud to direct since September 2015. ""For me, Catholicism is by nature conservative, in the literal sense. It preserves the deposit of faith. The Church is against homosexual unions and abortion, as far as I know, isn't it? A Catholic school can't say otherwise.""At the beginning of summer, the director welcomed Le Monde to Stanislas, in the former 18th-century mansion where the administration is based. The old-fashioned decor adds to the formality of the place. Following in the footsteps of Father De Lagarde, Gautier presented his establishment – 3,660 students, including 750 boarders, from kindergarten through to preparatory classes – as a classic, traditional sanctuary. ""A school is a place of learning, not militancy,"" he said. ""That's why I refuse to let the wildest societal issues, such as wokeism, become a subject of concern here.""

"Hindu extremists are 'hunting down' Muslims, with impunity","    After religious violence between Hindus and Muslims in late July, radical groups like the Bajrang Dal are sowing terror in a climate of impunity. ","""We've chased away all the Muslim tailors who used to work there,"" said Ashish Kumar and Somvir Singh proudly. The two 20-something lanky companions seemed to be killing time in front of a mechanic's shop in the Badshahpur market in the town of Gurgaon and its pothole-ridden streets. Located in the state of Haryana, which borders the capital New Delhi and is home to the headquarters of multinational corporations like Microsoft and Google, the city witnessed an outburst of religious violence in early August. In retaliation for clashes that took place during a Hindu procession on July 31 in Nuh, some 40 kilometers away, Muslim-owned businesses were ransacked, a mosque was set on fire and one of its clerics murdered. The violence then spread across the state, resulting in the death of at least six people.In the days that followed, members of far-right Hindu organizations began hunting down Muslim families who had come from other states in the country to work in ""Millennium City,"" as Gurgaon is nicknamed. ""Youths from neighboring villages threatened Muslim shopkeepers with burning down their stalls, ordering them to leave,"" said Sonu Yadav, a resident who works not far from the Badshahpur district and witnessed the violence. The charred wreckage of a tire business still lies along the road, while other makeshift stores, spared by the rioters, have been left abandoned. Threatened, the owners opted to flee. The Muslim barbers who usually set up shop along the sidewalk also disappeared.Kumar and Singh boasted of having contributed to this climate of terror. Sitting on a plastic chair, Somvir argued that ""Almost 100% of the violence against Muslims is justified,"" repeating the conspiracy theories prevalent in extremist circles. Both are members of the Bajrang Dal, the youth movement of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (World Council of Hindus, VHP), an extremist group belonging to the same ideological family as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party. Founded in 1984, the Bajrang Dal is a militant organization promoting Indutva, the ruling party's Hindu supremacist project to transform secular India into a Hindu nation.Calls for a boycott of the Muslim community and threats by Bajrang Dal's members have proliferated throughout the state of Haryana. In the town of Hansi, 150 kilometers from Gurgaon, a member of the organization urged local shopkeepers to fire their Muslim employees, threatening them with a boycott. In a widely shared video on social media, he could be seen moving around town with a microphone in hand, escorted by a crowd and under the eyes of law enforcement forces. ""If in two days' time, a Muslim vendor is still there, he will be solely responsible for what happens to him,"" said the man, against whom the police have brought legal action, including for hate speech.",Religions,weve chased away muslim tailors used work said ashish kumar somvir singh proudly two something lanky companions seemed killing time front mechanics shop badshahpur market town gurgaon pothole ridden streets located state haryana borders capital new delhi home headquarters multinational corporations like microsoft google city witnessed outburst religious violence early august retaliation clashes took place hindu procession july nuh kilometers away muslim owned businesses ransacked mosque set fire one clerics murdered violence spread across state resulting death least six people days followed members far right hindu organizations began hunting muslim families come states country work millennium city gurgaon nicknamed youths neighboring villages threatened muslim shopkeepers burning stalls ordering leave said sonu yadav resident works far badshahpur district witnessed violence charred wreckage tire business still lies along road makeshift stores spared rioters left abandoned threatened owners opted flee muslim barbers usually set shop along sidewalk also disappeared kumar singh boasted contributed climate terror sitting plastic chair somvir argued almost violence muslims justified repeating conspiracy theories prevalent extremist circles members bajrang dal youth movement vishva hindu parishad world council hindus vhp extremist group belonging ideological family prime minister narendra modis party founded bajrang dal militant organization promoting indutva ruling partys hindu supremacist project transform secular india hindu nation calls boycott muslim community threats bajrang dals members proliferated throughout state haryana town hansi kilometers gurgaon member organization urged local shopkeepers fire muslim employees threatening boycott widely shared video social media could seen moving around town microphone hand escorted crowd eyes law enforcement forces two days time muslim vendor still solely responsible happens said man police brought legal action including hate speech,weve chase away muslim tailor use work said ashish kumar somvir singh proudli two someth lanki companion seem kill time front mechan shop badshahpur market town gurgaon pothol ridden street locat state haryana border capit new delhi home headquart multin corpor like microsoft googl citi wit outburst religi violenc earli august retali clash took place hindu process juli nuh kilomet away muslim own busi ransack mosqu set fire one cleric murder violenc spread across state result death least six peopl day follow member far right hindu organ began hunt muslim famili come state countri work millennium citi gurgaon nicknam youth neighbor villag threaten muslim shopkeep burn stall order leav said sonu yadav resid work far badshahpur district wit violenc char wreckag tire busi still lie along road makeshift store spare rioter left abandon threaten owner opt flee muslim barber usual set shop along sidewalk also disappear kumar singh boast contribut climat terror sit plastic chair somvir argu almost violenc muslim justifi repeat conspiraci theori preval extremist circl member bajrang dal youth movement vishva hindu parishad world council hindu vhp extremist group belong ideolog famili prime minist narendra modi parti found bajrang dal milit organ promot indutva rule parti hindu supremacist project transform secular india hindu nation call boycott muslim commun threat bajrang dal member prolifer throughout state haryana town hansi kilomet gurgaon member organ urg local shopkeep fire muslim employe threaten boycott wide share video social media could seen move around town microphon hand escort crowd eye law enforc forc two day time muslim vendor still sole respons happen said man polic brought legal action includ hate speech
"Investigation: Wagner's heavy toll in Mali, one year after France's pull-out",   ,,Investigations,,
"Descendants ask for restitution of Paris human zoo victims: 'People died, where are they?'","    The bodies of eight Kalina people from French Guiana who died in 1892 are held in national collections. Their remains could be returned to their homeland, as the French government has pledged to facilitate restitutions to overseas territories. ","On June 13, the Sénat adopted on first reading a bill that has wide support but remains sensitive. The legislation, sponsored by Senators Catherine Morin-Desailly (Union Centriste, centrist), Max Brisson (Les Républicains, right-wing) and Pierre Ouzoulias (Communist), will soon facilitate the restitution of foreign human remains held in French public collections.Up until now, a specific law required the return of any inalienable object kept in museums to be done on a case-by-case basis. Such was the situation for the Maori head handed over by the city of Rouen to New Zealand in 2011, or for the remains of the slave Saartjie Baartman, known as the ""Hottentot Venus,"" returned to South Africa by a 2002 law.""Restitutions have always been the subject of debate, as museums consider these pieces to be archives of humanity, preserved for their scientific interest. What's more, returning them has often been a government act, and when it comes to human remains, we've kept a low profile for a long while,"" said André Delpuech, general curator of French heritage and a specialist in colonial archeology. French presidents appreciate the fact that they can use these gestures to support their diplomatic initiatives. In 2020, Emmanuel Macron's handover to Algeria of 24 skulls of colonial war resistance fighters – in reality, a deposit limited to five years, in the absence of any legislation – constituted ""a deviation that should not be repeated,"" the senators stated.Now, a clear general framework should enable a more rapid response to a request from a third country to recover identified human remains on behalf of descendants. However, the collections, especially those at the National Museum of Natural History (MNHN) include French bones, including from overseas territories. In an amendment supported by Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak, the government has therefore promised to study ""a permanent procedure"" for returning the fragments from overseas. The MNHN holds 24,000 mostly anonymous human remains, 8,000 of which are French, and 1,200 of those from overseas territories.Eight of them had a tragic fate: They were Kalina (also known as Galibi), Amerindians from French Guiana who lived on either side of the Maroni River and froze to death in Paris in 1892. They are listed in the Museum's collections: six skeletons stored on racks, two others identified by casts. Thanks to the patient work of a French woman from this community, their names can now be brought to light. Corinne Toka Devilliers, head of the organization Moliko Alet + Po (""the descendants of Moliko""), is fighting so that her ancestors can return to their homeland.

"Yevgeny Prigozhin, Dmitry Utkin: What we know about the passengers listed aboard the Wagner plane",Investigation,"Just a few hours after the private Embraer RA-02795 jet crashed near Kujenkino, northwest of Moscow, on August 23, Russian-speaking Telegram channels went into panic mode. The list of the seven passengers and three crew members had just been published on the instant messaging app by the Federal Aviation Agency. Yevgeny Prigozhin's name was on it.The Wagner mercenary chief was not the only of the group's leaders recorded on the flight. Others, some of them high-ranking within the organization, were also supposedly on board. Thanks to open data and leaked internal Wagner documents, Le Monde has put together profiles for some of these passengers.He's the head of the Wagner Group. After several years of denying it, in September 2022 Prigozhin finally acknowledged having founded the mercenary group, in 2014. Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he has not stopped speaking out in defense of his men – even to the point of openly opposing the Russian Ministry of Defense.On June 23, 2023, Prigozhin and some of his mercenaries rebelled and headed for Moscow. The mutiny, which failed, resulted in the exile of some of his troops to Belarus.Utkin is a key figure within the Wagner group. Born in June 1970, the former member of the Russian special forces (GRU) went to fight in Syria in 2013 with the Slavonic Corps, a group of Russian mercenaries. On his return, he and his fellow fighters were arrested by the FSB. Mercenary work is officially forbidden in Russia. Utkin escaped conviction.The rest of his journey is not so clear. How, in what context and why did he meet Prigozhin? As early as 2014, he began leading soldiers paid by Prigozhin, according to Dossier Center, a group of investigators funded by Russian businessman and dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Utkin reported directly to Prigozhin and adopted his nickname, ""Wagner,"" which would soon be used to name the entire group. Since then, the Wagner Group steadily expanded its activities in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa, with the backing and complicity of the Kremlin.In an internal document seen by Le Monde, Utkin, nom de guerre ""Ninth,"" was listed as ""commander"" of Evro Polis in 2021, the Wagner Group's front company in Syria. Utkin was at the heart of the Wagner group right up to the very end.According to Dossier Center, the 47-year-old businessman held an important position within the Wagner Group. Chekalov was in charge of security and logistical support for the mercenaries. Nicknamed ""Rover"" and holder of serial number M-2444, he managed natural resource exploitation projects, particularly oil, in countries where Wagner was active. Through his company Neva, he was linked to Evro Polis.",Investigations,hours private embraer jet crashed near kujenkino northwest moscow august russian speaking telegram channels went panic mode list seven passengers three crew members published instant messaging app federal aviation agency yevgeny prigozhins name wagner mercenary chief groups leaders recorded flight others high ranking within organization also supposedly board thanks open data leaked internal wagner documents monde put together profiles passengers hes head wagner group several years denying september prigozhin finally acknowledged founded mercenary group since start russias invasion ukraine february stopped speaking defense men even point openly opposing russian ministry defense june prigozhin mercenaries rebelled headed moscow mutiny failed resulted exile troops belarus utkin key figure within wagner group born june former member russian special forces gru went fight syria slavonic corps group russian mercenaries return fellow fighters arrested fsb mercenary work officially forbidden russia utkin escaped conviction rest journey clear context meet prigozhin early began leading soldiers paid prigozhin according dossier center group investigators funded russian businessman dissident mikhail khodorkovsky utkin reported directly prigozhin adopted nickname wagner would soon used name entire group since wagner group steadily expanded activities ukraine middle east africa backing complicity kremlin internal document seen monde utkin nom guerre ninth listed commander evro polis wagner groups front company syria utkin heart wagner group right end according dossier center year old businessman held important position within wagner group chekalov charge security logistical support mercenaries nicknamed rover holder serial number managed natural resource exploitation projects particularly oil countries wagner active company neva linked evro polis,hour privat embraer jet crash near kujenkino northwest moscow august russian speak telegram channel went panic mode list seven passeng three crew member publish instant messag app feder aviat agenc yevgeni prigozhin name wagner mercenari chief group leader record flight other high rank within organ also supposedli board thank open data leak intern wagner document mond put togeth profil passeng he head wagner group sever year deni septemb prigozhin final acknowledg found mercenari group sinc start russia invas ukrain februari stop speak defens men even point openli oppos russian ministri defens june prigozhin mercenari rebel head moscow mutini fail result exil troop belaru utkin key figur within wagner group born june former member russian special forc gru went fight syria slavon corp group russian mercenari return fellow fighter arrest fsb mercenari work offici forbidden russia utkin escap convict rest journey clear context meet prigozhin earli began lead soldier paid prigozhin accord dossier center group investig fund russian businessman dissid mikhail khodorkovski utkin report directli prigozhin adopt nicknam wagner would soon use name entir group sinc wagner group steadili expand activ ukrain middl east africa back complic kremlin intern document seen mond utkin nom guerr ninth list command evro poli wagner group front compani syria utkin heart wagner group right end accord dossier center year old businessman held import posit within wagner group chekalov charg secur logist support mercenari nicknam rover holder serial number manag natur resourc exploit project particularli oil countri wagner activ compani neva link evro poli
Belarus brings in thousands of Ukrainian children to 'Russify' them,"    Minsk, with the aid of the Belarusian Red Cross, has brought more than 2,150 minors into its territory since the invasion of Ukraine, claiming to be offering them 'respite'. ","Russia is not alone in forcibly transferring Ukrainian children to its territory. Less well known is the fact that Belarus, Moscow's number-one ally in the war in Ukraine, also engages in this illegal practice, which could constitute a war crime. More than 2,150 Ukrainians aged between 6 and 15 living in Russian-occupied areas have been deported to Belarus since the Russian invasion in February 2022, according to official Belarusian documents and statements, consulted by Le Monde, and leaks compiled by Belarusian opposition politician Pavel Latushko, who was sentenced in March to eighteen years in prison in absentia in Minsk after a sham trial. A former member of the regime, Latushko submitted evidence of  Belarus' involvement in these forced displacements to the International Criminal Court (ICC) on June 27.In March, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova, for organizing the illegal transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko too could eventually be the subject of an arrest warrant.On September 13, the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning ""the illegal transfer of more than 2,150 children, including orphans, from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine to so-called recreation camps in Belarus, where they are subjected to Russification and indoctrination"". The European Parliament said that ""Alexander Lukashenko is as responsible for these war crimes as Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova,"" and called on the ICC to ""issue a similar international arrest warrant for"" the Belarusian leader.The Minsk regime makes no secret of these forced transfers. On the contrary, it claims that they are ""humanitarian"" operations designed to offer respite to war-torn children. In August, Lukashenko publicly acknowledged his direct involvement, in close collaboration with Russia. ""We agreed with Vladimir Putin that we would finance these trips from the state budget of the Union [a treaty linking Russia and Belarus],"" he said. ""We have done so and will continue to do so without worrying about any reproach.""Belarus, which has served as a rear base for Russian troops since the invasion of Ukraine, boasted that it had brought in ""over a thousand children"" in the spring. On Tuesday, September 19, a group of 48 Ukrainian children arrived from the occupied regions of Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia.

"476,000 years old: Historic discovery of the oldest wooden structure","    An international research team has unearthed a prehistoric, wooden assemblage in Zambia that challenges our understanding of ancient humans, long before the arrival of Homo Sapiens. ","The Stone Age was also the Wood Age. But, until today, there had not been so much talk about that. While the lithic tools and shells used by prehistoric humans have stood the test of time, the same cannot be said for objects made of organic matter, which require very specific conditions to avoid decomposition. But on Wednesday, September 20, an international team announced the discovery of the oldest wooden structure ever unearthed in Nature. And it's 476,000 years old − meaning it dates from an age in which modern humans had not yet appeared.The find took place in northern Zambia, not far from the Kalambo River Falls. ""The site lies on the banks of the river, which floods regularly, bringing with it sediment. It is thanks to this permanent humidity that the wood was preserved,"" explained Veerle Rots, professor of prehistory at the University of Liège in Belgium and co-author of the study. Excavated as early as the 1950s by British archaeologist John Desmond Clark (1916-2002), the site ""had already yielded some interesting remains, but we didn't know how to date them. The chronological framework remained vague,"" added Rots.In 2019, a collaboration between the University of Liège and the British universities of Liverpool and Aberystwyth revived excavations at Kalambo Falls. In the waterlogged sands, the team discovered several wooden objects, including an astonishing cruciform assemblage. Two superimposed logs were embedded by a U-shaped notch, over 10 centimeters wide, ""clearly man-made,"" in Rots' words, who based her assertion on a series of marks left in the wood by stone tools.A tricky challenge remained: determining the period in which this structure had been produced. Carbon-14 dating was not useful, as it does not go back further than 50,000 years. To get their answer, the researchers used a technique that dates not the object itself, but the sediments in which it is buried: luminescence dating.It exploits the ability of certain natural crystals, such as quartz and feldspar, to act as dosimeters, thanks to small structural defects that act as electron traps. ""Under the effect of natural radioactivity, these crystals accumulate energy, which they release when heated or illuminated in the laboratory,"" explained said Lahaye, professor of geochronology at Bordeaux-Montaigne University and Director of the Archéosciences laboratory, which specializes in the study of archaeological heritage materials.Whenever sunlight strikes them, these grains of quartz or feldspar see their ""internal clock"" reset to zero. It restarts and accumulates energy when it's in the dark – in other words, when the sediments are buried. The amount of energy stored is proportional to the time spent in the dark. ""What we're going to measure with this technique,"" Lahaye summed up, ""is the time that has elapsed since these crystals were last exposed to light.""",Science,stone age also wood age today much talk lithic tools shells used prehistoric humans stood test time said objects made organic matter require specific conditions avoid decomposition wednesday september international team announced discovery oldest wooden structure ever unearthed nature years old meaning dates age modern humans yet appeared find took place northern zambia far kalambo river falls site lies banks river floods regularly bringing sediment thanks permanent humidity wood preserved explained veerle rots professor prehistory university belgium author study excavated early british archaeologist john desmond clark site already yielded interesting remains didnt know date chronological framework remained vague added rots collaboration university british universities liverpool aberystwyth revived excavations kalambo falls waterlogged sands team discovered several wooden objects including astonishing cruciform assemblage two superimposed logs embedded shaped notch centimeters wide clearly man made rots words based assertion series marks left wood stone tools tricky challenge remained determining period structure produced carbon dating useful back years get answer researchers used technique dates object sediments buried luminescence dating exploits ability certain natural crystals quartz feldspar act dosimeters thanks small structural defects act electron traps effect natural radioactivity crystals accumulate energy release heated illuminated laboratory explained said lahaye professor geochronology bordeaux montaigne university director arch osciences laboratory specializes study archaeological heritage materials whenever sunlight strikes grains quartz feldspar see internal clock reset zero restarts accumulates energy dark words sediments buried amount energy stored proportional time spent dark going measure technique lahaye summed time elapsed since crystals last exposed light,stone age also wood age today much talk lithic tool shell use prehistor human stood test time said object made organ matter requir specif condit avoid decomposit wednesday septemb intern team announc discoveri oldest wooden structur ever unearth natur year old mean date age modern human yet appear find took place northern zambia far kalambo river fall site lie bank river flood regularli bring sediment thank perman humid wood preserv explain veerl rot professor prehistori univers belgium author studi excav earli british archaeologist john desmond clark site alreadi yield interest remain didnt know date chronolog framework remain vagu ad rot collabor univers british univers liverpool aberystwyth reviv excav kalambo fall waterlog sand team discov sever wooden object includ astonish cruciform assemblag two superimpos log embed shape notch centimet wide clearli man made rot word base assert seri mark left wood stone tool tricki challeng remain determin period structur produc carbon date use back year get answer research use techniqu date object sediment buri luminesc date exploit abil certain natur crystal quartz feldspar act dosimet thank small structur defect act electron trap effect natur radioact crystal accumul energi releas heat illumin laboratori explain said lahay professor geochronolog bordeaux montaign univers director arch oscienc laboratori special studi archaeolog heritag materi whenev sunlight strike grain quartz feldspar see intern clock reset zero restart accumul energi dark word sediment buri amount energi store proport time spent dark go measur techniqu lahay sum time elaps sinc crystal last expos light

How a rave party near Gaza turned into horror,Investigation,"Daylight was on the horizon and the music was still loud at the Supernova rave festival in southern Israel. People were smiling. Videos taken by those attending captured the scene. At around 6 am, in the distance, plumes of smoke appeared in the sky. Rockets that were fired from the Gaza Strip were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome, its anti-aircraft system. It was Saturday, October 7, and Hamas had just launched ""Operation Al-Aqsa Flood,"" a large-scale attack against Israel.Surrounded by fields and trees, the site of the rave was far away from residential areas. Between the two kibbutz of Be'eri, to the north, and Re'im, to the south, people danced less than 6 kilometers from the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. Some 3,500 people had been gathered that day.While the first rockets were intercepted far up in the sky, the DJs continued playing. But confusion quickly set in. Videos authenticated and analyzed by Le Monde show security and police officers passing among the rave-goers. They are ordered to leave the premises immediately. The instructions are also broadcast over loudspeakers. Some did not immediately understand the situation and asked why they were being asked to leave.Around 9 am, the first set of Palestinian fighters approached the venue. According to eyewitness accounts, there were dozens of them. The security force members present, barely a dozen, according to the images analyzed by Le Monde, were not equipped to deal with them. They wore neither bulletproof vests nor helmets – they just had handguns.They did, however, attempt to set up a roadblock on Route 232 a few dozen meters north of the entrance to the event. They were then joined by an Israeli Merkava tank. Equipped with a powerful 120 mm cannon, this tank was of no use at the time, except as a refuge thanks to its armored plating. Dozens of participants took cover behind it, along with some of the police. Bullets rattled. The assailants were there.Hamas commandos burst out from all sides, according to testimonies gathered by the Israeli press and Le Monde. They targeted those at the rave, firing into the crowd with automatic weapons.A car dashcam recorded part of the scene from the festival's parking lot. The moment, verified by Le Monde, shows a Hamas militiaman, armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, capturing one of the participants of the rave. Covered in blood but alive, the hostage emerged from behind the camera with his hands on his head.Seconds later, another attacker, armed with an assault rifle, appeared on the right-hand side of the screen, running towards the rear of a car.  A man was lying there, presumably wounded. The attacker shot him at point-blank range.

Israel-Hamas: The context behind the war,"    Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel has provoked a war that is unprecedented. It's the first time conflict has broken out on such a scale on Israeli territory, in a context that leaves less and less room for a peaceful outcome. ","During Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, which began on October 7, the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas infiltrated several hundred of its fighters into Israeli territory, killing on the spot or taking hundreds of hostages. To date, more than 1,200 people have been killed on the Israeli side, the vast majority of them civilians living near the Gaza Strip. On the Palestinian side, Israel's military response has led to the deaths of at least 830 people, according to the death toll as of October 12.The scale and violence of Hamas' surprise attack mark a new deadly chapter in the war between Hamas and Israel and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Researchers who enabled mRNA Covid vaccine win medicine Nobel Prize,    Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman have made a major contribution to the development of the revolutionary technology used in Covid-19 vaccines. ,"The Nobel Prize for Medicine is often criticized for only rewarding old scientists, usually men, who are almost always a long way from their discovery. Usually, the award is unrelated to current events, too. This year, however, the jury took the opposite route. On Monday, October 2, the Hungarian scientist Katalin Kariko, Vice President of BioNTech, and American scientist Drew Weissman, Professor of Vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania were awarded for their decisive contribution to the development of the messenger RNA vaccine. In other words, the jury awarded a woman and a man, both in their sixties – almost toddlers in the ranking – less than three years after the first use of this revolutionary technology.Meanwhile, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's messenger RNA vaccines have turned the world of research and healthcare upside down. In fact, they turned the world upside down. In the international race to immunize against Covid-19, these newcomers outstripped all previous technologies – inactivated or attenuated viruses, recombinant proteins, and viral vectors. In ten months, the two laboratories developed safe, protective vaccines. With an efficiency of 95% against the initial strain of the virus, they have even outperformed all their competitors. In Western countries, notably North America and Europe, they account for the overwhelming majority of doses administered. Without taking the slightest risk, we can therefore assert that the more than 13 billion injections of messenger RNA vaccines already carried out have made it possible to avoid an even deadlier catastrophe.The two scientists have already garnered a fine crop of awards. These include the Breakthrough Prize – the most endowed – the highly prestigious Princess of Asturias Prize and the prestigious Lasker Prize. The French Academy of Sciences also awarded its grand medal to Katalin Kariko. All that was missing was the laurels from the Swedish Academy, which everyone had been promising them for two years. Now they have them.But beware of false evidence. ""People should know that this wasn't just a one-off experiment that we did and the vaccine was made in 10 months,"" Drew Weissman told the New York Times. ""We did the modified mRNA and we are getting the honors, but the vaccines are based on 20-plus years of work by Kati and I and work by hundreds if not thousands of other scientists."" The prize list thus leaves in the shade those who came before, such as Americans Robert Malone and Philip Felgner, the first to have shown, in 1990, that a mixture of messenger RNA and fats could enter cells and produce proteins. Or France's Frédéric Martinon and Pierre Meulien, who established in 1993 that messenger RNA encapsulated in lipid spheres could trigger an immune response.",Science,nobel prize medicine often criticized rewarding old scientists usually men almost always long way discovery usually award unrelated current events year however jury took opposite route monday october hungarian scientist katalin kariko vice president biontech american scientist drew weissman professor vaccinology university pennsylvania awarded decisive contribution development messenger rna vaccine words jury awarded woman man sixties almost toddlers ranking less three years first use revolutionary technology meanwhile pfizer biontech modernas messenger rna vaccines turned world research healthcare upside fact turned world upside international race immunize covid newcomers outstripped previous technologies inactivated attenuated viruses recombinant proteins viral vectors ten months two laboratories developed safe protective vaccines efficiency initial strain virus even outperformed competitors western countries notably north america europe account overwhelming majority doses administered without taking slightest risk therefore assert billion injections messenger rna vaccines already carried made possible avoid even deadlier catastrophe two scientists already garnered fine crop awards include breakthrough prize endowed highly prestigious princess asturias prize prestigious lasker prize french academy sciences also awarded grand medal katalin kariko missing laurels swedish academy everyone promising two years beware false evidence people know wasnt one experiment vaccine made months drew weissman told new york times modified mrna getting honors vaccines based plus years work kati work hundreds thousands scientists prize list thus leaves shade came americans robert malone philip felgner first shown mixture messenger rna fats could enter cells produce proteins frances ric martinon pierre meulien established messenger rna encapsulated lipid spheres could trigger immune response,nobel prize medicin often critic reward old scientist usual men almost alway long way discoveri usual award unrel current event year howev juri took opposit rout monday octob hungarian scientist katalin kariko vice presid biontech american scientist drew weissman professor vaccinolog univers pennsylvania award decis contribut develop messeng rna vaccin word juri award woman man sixti almost toddler rank less three year first use revolutionari technolog meanwhil pfizer biontech moderna messeng rna vaccin turn world research healthcar upsid fact turn world upsid intern race immun covid newcom outstrip previou technolog inactiv attenu virus recombin protein viral vector ten month two laboratori develop safe protect vaccin effici initi strain viru even outperform competitor western countri notabl north america europ account overwhelm major dose administ without take slightest risk therefor assert billion inject messeng rna vaccin alreadi carri made possibl avoid even deadlier catastroph two scientist alreadi garner fine crop award includ breakthrough prize endow highli prestigi princess asturia prize prestigi lasker prize french academi scienc also award grand medal katalin kariko miss laurel swedish academi everyon promis two year bewar fals evid peopl know wasnt one experi vaccin made month drew weissman told new york time modifi mrna get honor vaccin base plu year work kati work hundr thousand scientist prize list thu leav shade came american robert malon philip felgner first shown mixtur messeng rna fat could enter cell produc protein franc ric martinon pierr meulien establish messeng rna encapsul lipid sphere could trigger immun respons
"What to know about Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel","    Considered a 'terrorist organization' by Israel, the United States, the European Union and many other countries, the Islamist movement was born in the late 1980s. ","Hamas, whose full name is the Islamic Resistance Movement, originated from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and was created in the wake of the First Intifada in 1987, the conflict between the Israeli army and the Palestinian population. The main goals of this Islamist movement, which does not recognize the State of Israel, have always been to reclaim the militarily occupied Palestinian territories and establish an Islamic Palestinian state.Since its creation, the movement has advocated for armed struggle and rejected peace processes such as the 1993 Oslo Accords. With its Al-Qassam military brigades, the group continues to multiply its attacks against Israel. The Jewish state always retaliates against these attacks, even if it means causing casualties among Palestinian civilians.Over time, Hamas has strengthened its ties with the Palestinian population, developed alliances with Arab countries and increased its military capabilities.

Israel-Hamas war: Images reveal the strategy behind the militant group's attack,Video,"The sun had not yet risen in Gaza when Hamas launched Operation Al Aqsa Flood on Saturday, October 7. Dozens of the organization's fighters advanced toward the Israeli border by car, motorcycle and on foot. They blocked cameras and defense systems and made at least seven breaches in the wall separating the two territories.Once through, the fighters simultaneously attacked at least six IDF military bases and seven civilian areas, including a town, five kibbutzim and a music festival.Using analyzed and verified images, Le Monde has reconstructed the group's master plan behind Saturday's attack, which involved lightning raids, simultaneous assaults and preparation.The border between the Gaza Strip and Israel consists of either high fences or a concrete wall. Its towers are guarded by remotely operated machine guns, so, to cross it, attackers have to neutralize its defense posts. Of the five posts filmed by Hamas militants, four were destroyed by an explosive device dropped from a drone.Also using drones, Hamas targeted telecoms infrastructures, such as a pylon near the Be'eri kibbutz. The aim: To cut off the Israeli army as quickly as possible.Elsewhere, by car, motorcycle and on foot, Hamas began its assault on the border. Some breaches were made by using hand-laid explosives, like near the Be'eri kibbutz. In a satellite image taken at the Erez Crossing, north of the Gaza Strip, a breach in the concrete wall separating it from Israel and two partial destructions could be seen.Once the border was opened, Hamas militiamen crossed it on all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and small motorcycles. At Kerem Shalom kibbutz, near the border with Egypt, the space cut into the fence was only wide enough for the motorcycles to get through.Images show that at least a dozen groups of Hamas militiamen had entered Israeli territory before 7 am. Less than an hour later, they simultaneously launched at least 13 assaults on military camps and civilian areas.At least six permanent IDF military bases were attacked at the same time, between 6:30 and 8:30 a.m. They included the Erez Crossing, the Nahal Oz military base, the base near the Be'eri kibbutz, the Sufa outpost, the Re'im base and a facility near the Kerem Shalom kibbutz.Armed with grenades, rocket launchers and extended firearms, Hamas militiamen penetrated the bases. They killed Israeli soldiers, captured others, and filmed themselves triumphantly next to their bodies.

Gaza hospital: What detailed image analysis reveals about deadly blast,Investigation,"On Tuesday, October 17, Al Jazeera filmed the rooftops of Gaza live as it has been doing every day since the war between Hamas and Israel began. On screen, the TV channel's news banner showed that it was 6:59 pm local time when a light rose into the sky before disappearing into a flash. Eight seconds later, a new flash could be seen, this time on the ground. An explosion soon sounded at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza.Hamas quickly accused the Israeli army of bombing the hospital. According to them, 471 people were killed in the explosion. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari denied that the blast came from an Israeli air strike, and instead blamed the damage on ""an Islamic Jihad rocket that misfired.""Le Monde has authenticated and analyzed a dozen photos and videos of the blast. While these images cannot be used to ascert the origin of the explosion, they do provide a number of contextual elements, such as the trajectory of the projectile visible in Al Jazeera's video, the presence of rockets fired from Gaza in the moments preceding the explosion and the kind of damage that was caused.Located 1.4 kilometers northwest of the hospital, in the heart of Gaza, the Al Jazeera camera captured everything that happened to the east of the city. The images showed a projectile advancing from the right to the left of the screen. It formed a bell-shaped trajectory, then exploded in the sky. The images did not follow the trajectories of any debris that may have hit the ground.The camera then zoomed out and moved downward. Five seconds after the first explosion, another occurred on the ground. Three seconds later, a third, much larger explosion could be seen. Le Monde has been able to confirm that the third explosion took place inside the Al Ahli Arab Hospital, which can be identified by several buildings. Al Jazeera station reported the time as 6:59 pm local time.Israeli channel N12 also claimed to have obtained images of the moment the hospital was hit by an explosion, taken by a surveillance camera in Netivot, Israel, ten kilometers from the border.

"The story of the Gaza Strip, explained","    Home to 2.3 million Palestinians, Gaza, wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea, has been under blockade for 16 years. This unprecedented situation is the result of a turbulent history. ","The Gaza Strip, an enclave that is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, takes its name from its shape: a long, narrow rectangle of 360 km2, wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.Gaza's borders as they exist today date back to 1967. From that time, the ""strip"" and its inhabitants lived under Israeli occupation for 38 years, until 2005. In 2006, the Islamist party Hamas, which calls for the destruction of Israel, won the legislative elections. After a Palestinian civil war that saw the historic Fatah party ousted from power, Israel, backed by Egypt, imposed in 2007 a land, air and sea blockade around the strip, which is still in place today.Following Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israeli territory, Israel's ""complete siege"" of Gaza, accompanied by massive bombardments since October 8, risks worsening an already ""dire"" humanitarian situation that will ""deteriorate exponentially,"" warned United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres.In this three-minute video, Le Monde explains how the Gaza Strip came to be, and why this enclave is so often compared to an ""open-air prison.""",Videos,gaza strip enclave one densely populated areas world takes name shape long narrow rectangle wedged israel egypt mediterranean sea gazas borders exist today date back time strip inhabitants lived israeli occupation years islamist party hamas calls destruction israel legislative elections palestinian civil war saw historic fatah party ousted power israel backed egypt imposed land air sea blockade around strip still place today following hamass october attacks israeli territory israels complete siege gaza accompanied massive bombardments since october risks worsening already dire humanitarian situation deteriorate exponentially warned united nations secretary general ant nio guterres three minute video monde explains gaza strip came enclave often compared open air prison,gaza strip enclav one dens popul area world take name shape long narrow rectangl wedg israel egypt mediterranean sea gaza border exist today date back time strip inhabit live isra occup year islamist parti hama call destruct israel legisl elect palestinian civil war saw histor fatah parti oust power israel back egypt impos land air sea blockad around strip still place today follow hamass octob attack isra territori israel complet sieg gaza accompani massiv bombard sinc octob risk worsen alreadi dire humanitarian situat deterior exponenti warn unit nation secretari gener ant nio guterr three minut video mond explain gaza strip came enclav often compar open air prison
Why is the state of Israel located in the region of Palestine?,"    On October 7, Hamas attacked Israel, reigniting an almost century-old conflict that has shaken the region and the world. To understand this, we must go back to the creation of Israel. ","The Hamas attacks on October 7 have unleashed a war whose scale could surpass previous regional conflicts. Acts that could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity are condemned by both sides. The peace process initiated in 1993 during the Oslo Accords and the two-state solution have rarely seemed as inaccessible as they do today.In this video, we look back at a key stage in the history of this conflict: the creation of the state of Israel, from the conceptualization of Zionism to the establishment of a Jewish state in this region.

The IDF said that it had retrieved ""approximately 1,500 bodies"" of Hamas members on its territory.Israel has since launched a retaliatory bombing campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Why does Israel build settlements in the occupied West Bank?,"    The West Bank, which is a Palestinian territory under international law, is dotted with numerous settlements where Israeli families and communities live. These settlements, which Israel wishes to integrate into its territory, complicate attempts to resolve the conflict. ","There are 2.8 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. But 475,000 Israelis also live in the same territory, which they call Judea and Samaria. According to the international community, this land is Palestinian, but Israelis have taken control of certain localities and made their home there. In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this is what is known as a settlement.A settlement can be as small as a few houses, or as large as an entire town with a university, as in Ariel. Under international law, they are illegal, but Israeli law recognizes a number of them and the Israeli army protects their inhabitants.In this three-minute video, Le Monde analyzes this situation and explains the three main reasons why Israelis move to settlements in the West Bank.",Videos,million palestinians living west bank israelis also live territory call judea samaria according international community land palestinian israelis taken control certain localities made home context israeli palestinian conflict known settlement settlement small houses large entire town university ariel international law illegal israeli law recognizes number israeli army protects inhabitants three minute video monde analyzes situation explains three main reasons israelis move settlements west bank,million palestinian live west bank isra also live territori call judea samaria accord intern commun land palestinian isra taken control certain local made home context isra palestinian conflict known settlement settlement small hous larg entir town univers ariel intern law illeg isra law recogn number isra armi protect inhabit three minut video mond analyz situat explain three main reason isra move settlement west bank

But since the agreements' failure, some consider this solution unrealistic. ","When we discuss how peace might be achieved between Israelis and Palestinians, one scenario often comes up: the two-state solution. It advocates the creation of two independent states: one Palestinian, and the other Israeli. However, in recent years, this solution has become increasingly difficult to achieve.Since the failure of the Oslo Accords in 1993, more and more Israelis and Palestinians say they no longer see this as a viable solution. In this three-minute video, Le Monde explains the main obstacles to implementing the two-state solution: the issue of borders, the division of Jerusalem, and the return of exiled Palestinians.

Israel-Palestine: Six videos to understand the context behind the war in Gaza,    Le Monde breaks down the historical and contemporary context behind the conflict in these short explainer videos. ,"On Saturday, October 7, the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas infiltrated several hundred of its fighters into Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking hundreds of hostages. Later that day, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war on Hamas and launched a bombing campaign against the Gaza Strip as well as a ""complete blockade"" of the territory, banning the entry of essential items like food, water, medicine, fuel and electricity. The war has already cost the lives of thousands of Gazans (more than 7,000 as of October 26, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza).To understand this war, the latest in seven decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, we need to look at its historical roots as well as the current political tensions in the region. Le Monde breaks it down in six explainer videos.Home to 2.3 million Palestinians, Gaza, wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea, has been under blockade for 16 years. This enclave is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and is often compared to an ""open-air prison.""Hamas, whose full name is the Islamic Resistance Movement, originated from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and was created in the wake of the First Intifada in 1987, the conflict between the Israeli army and the Palestinian population. The main goals of this movement, which does not recognize the state of Israel, have always been to reclaim the militarily occupied Palestinian territories and establish an Islamic Palestinian state.The Israel-Hamas war marks a turning point in Israeli-Palestinian tensions, and the Gaza Strip is central to this conflict. Hamas and Israel have for years clashed with rocket fire and strikes. From 2008 to August 2023, over 6,400 Palestinians were killed, the vast majority in Gaza, while over 300 Israelis were killed in the same period, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.The State of Israel unilaterally proclaimed its existence in 1948, following a failed plan by the United Nations to partition Palestine into independent Arab and Jewish States, at the end of the region's British rule under a League of Nations mandate. This event was the result of European political choices made during a period of growing anti-Semitism and the birth of Zionism.The West Bank, which is a Palestinian territory under international law, is dotted with numerous settlements where Israeli families and communities live. Under international law, they are illegal, but Israeli law recognizes a number of them and the Israeli army protects their inhabitants.

Why is the United States Israel's closest ally?,"    Since Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel and the Jewish state's response in the Gaza Strip, the United States has once again affirmed its firm support for Israel. ","On October 27, the UN General Assembly voted in favor of an ""immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities"" in Gaza. Alongside Israel, 13 other countries voted against the resolution − among them was the United States.This comes as no surprise. The United States is a historic ally of Israel, and has been since the Jewish state's creation in 1948. At the time, President Harry Truman recognized the existence of the Jewish state ""just 11 minutes after its founding,"" as recalled by President Joe Biden during a visit to Tel Aviv on October 18.In this three-minute video, Le Monde explains the historical roots and driving forces behind the strategic alliance between these two countries.Watch more of Le Monde's explainer videos about the context behind the war in Gaza here.",Videos,october general assembly voted favor immediate durable sustained humanitarian truce leading cessation hostilities gaza alongside israel countries voted resolution among united states comes surprise united states historic ally israel since jewish states creation time president harry truman recognized existence jewish state minutes founding recalled president joe biden visit tel aviv october three minute video monde explains historical roots driving forces behind strategic alliance two countries watch mondes explainer videos context behind war gaza,octob gener assembl vote favor immedi durabl sustain humanitarian truce lead cessat hostil gaza alongsid israel countri vote resolut among unit state come surpris unit state histor alli israel sinc jewish state creation time presid harri truman recogn exist jewish state minut found recal presid joe biden visit tel aviv octob three minut video mond explain histor root drive forc behind strateg allianc two countri watch mond explain video context behind war gaza

Explosion at Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza: New findings from our investigation,Investigation,"On October 17, just before 7 pm, the skies over Gaza were lit up by bright lights: a dozen rockets launched from Gaza, a missile fired from Israel, and two fighter jets. A few moments later, an explosion struck the Al-Ahli Hospital, killing a number of people that is still uncertain to this day.Two weeks after the blast, Le Monde's analysis of the images shows the trajectory and speed of a salvo of Palestinian rockets are compatible with the explosion at the hospital. Our investigation sheds light on a night of clashes, from exchanged fire to the presence of two fighter jets, probably Israeli, without establishing with certainty the cause of the explosion.At 6:59 pm, the parking lot of Al-Ahli Hospital was devastated by an explosion. Soon afterward, images revealed a crater barely a meter in diameter.As reported by the BBC, a photo taken 40 minutes after the blast shows a Palestinian police officer near the crater. He belongs to the Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD), which specializes in explosive devices and their neutralization, with duties that include collecting projectile debris and investigating explosions.Yet two weeks later, no photos of debris have been published by Hamas. According to Marc Garlasco, a former military expert for the UN, ""There's always a piece of a bomb after the fact. In 20 years of investigating war crimes, this is the first time I haven't seen any weapon remnants. And I've worked three wars in Gaza."" Hamas representatives initially told the New York Times the missile ""is vaporized. Nothing is left."" They later told the Washington Post that they were in possession of remnants that ""will soon be shown to the world.""Israel was quick to blame a dysfunctional rocket from Islamic Jihad, another armed group in Gaza, and presented its evidence: Footage filmed by Al-Jazeera. The footage shows a projectile rising and then exploding in the air. In the same footage, a few seconds later, the explosion takes place in the hospital. According to Israel, this was a Palestinian rocket, whose debris landed and caused the explosion in the hospital.Using the three camera angles that show the projectile taking off, Le Monde was able to triangulate its position. It was actually fired from Israel, in an area where an Iron Dome missile system is located. This system detects Palestinian rockets in flight and attempts to shoot them down using guided missiles. According to the same images, the projectile exploded some 20 seconds after take-off, over Israeli territory.",Videos,october skies gaza lit bright lights dozen rockets launched gaza missile fired israel two fighter jets moments later explosion struck ahli hospital killing number people still uncertain day two weeks blast mondes analysis images shows trajectory speed salvo palestinian rockets compatible explosion hospital investigation sheds light night clashes exchanged fire presence two fighter jets probably israeli without establishing certainty cause explosion parking lot ahli hospital devastated explosion soon afterward images revealed crater barely meter diameter reported bbc photo taken minutes blast shows palestinian police officer near crater belongs explosive ordinance disposal eod specializes explosive devices neutralization duties include collecting projectile debris investigating explosions yet two weeks later photos debris published hamas according marc garlasco former military expert theres always piece bomb fact years investigating war crimes first time havent seen weapon remnants ive worked three wars gaza hamas representatives initially told new york times missile vaporized nothing left later told washington post possession remnants soon shown world israel quick blame dysfunctional rocket islamic jihad another armed group gaza presented evidence footage filmed jazeera footage shows projectile rising exploding air footage seconds later explosion takes place hospital according israel palestinian rocket whose debris landed caused explosion hospital using three camera angles show projectile taking monde able triangulate position actually fired israel area iron dome missile system located system detects palestinian rockets flight attempts shoot using guided missiles according images projectile exploded seconds take israeli territory,octob sky gaza lit bright light dozen rocket launch gaza missil fire israel two fighter jet moment later explos struck ahli hospit kill number peopl still uncertain day two week blast mond analysi imag show trajectori speed salvo palestinian rocket compat explos hospit investig shed light night clash exchang fire presenc two fighter jet probabl isra without establish certainti caus explos park lot ahli hospit devast explos soon afterward imag reveal crater bare meter diamet report bbc photo taken minut blast show palestinian polic offic near crater belong explos ordin dispos eod special explos devic neutral duti includ collect projectil debri investig explos yet two week later photo debri publish hama accord marc garlasco former militari expert there alway piec bomb fact year investig war crime first time havent seen weapon remnant ive work three war gaza hama repres initi told new york time missil vapor noth left later told washington post possess remnant soon shown world israel quick blame dysfunct rocket islam jihad anoth arm group gaza present evid footag film jazeera footag show projectil rise explod air footag second later explos take place hospit accord israel palestinian rocket whose debri land caus explos hospit use three camera angl show projectil take mond abl triangul posit actual fire israel area iron dome missil system locat system detect palestinian rocket flight attempt shoot use guid missil accord imag projectil explod second take isra territori

Fentanyl, or rather, M30, is a blue pill that is 20 to 40 times more potent than heroin. It's a drug that kills – and earns its producers billions of dollars.For two years, Bertrand Monnet plunged deep into the heart of Mexico's most powerful cartel: the Sinaloa Cartel. With his camera in hand, the French EDHEC business school professor and specialist in criminal economics, documented, for the first time, every stage of the narcos' business model, from the manufacture of fentanyl in Culiacan garages to the laundering of dirty money in Dubai's skyscrapers.Monnet's footage and interviews, filmed for Le Monde, provide a better understanding of how these ultra-efficient, violent international criminal operations function.

Are abortion rights under threat in France?,    French President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants to enshrine women's 'freedom' to have an abortion in the French constitution by 2024. ,"On Sunday, October 29, President Emmanuel Macron took a step toward enshrining the right to abortion in the French constitution, announcing that a bill to protect this right would be presented at the end of 2023. ""By 2024, women's freedom to have recourse to abortion will be irreversible,"" Macron said.However, some conservative and far-right leaders have criticized this constitutional reform, accusing the president of ""importing an American debate"" following the Supreme Court’s decision to eliminate the constitutional right to abortion in June 2022. The president of the Rassemblement National (far-right), Marine Le Pen, called the text ""totally useless."" ""No political movement, whether inside or outside of the Assemblée Nationale, is calling for abortion to be called into question,"" said the former presidential candidate on October 29.Yet several countries that recognize abortion as a legal right have recently clamped down on access to the procedure without actually banning it. This was the case in Poland, where since 2021, several pregnant women have died because they failed to get medical pregnancy terminations in time.In France, no political group is currently calling for a tightening of the rules governing abortion. However, not all French women have equal access to the procedure. In this two-minute explainer video, Le Monde looks at the issues surrounding abortion rights in France and why Macron wants to enshrine the right to abortion in the constitution now.",Videos,sunday october president emmanuel macron took step toward enshrining right abortion french constitution announcing bill protect right would presented end womens freedom recourse abortion irreversible macron said however conservative far right leaders criticized constitutional reform accusing president importing american debate following supreme court decision eliminate constitutional right abortion june president rassemblement national far right marine pen called text totally useless political movement whether inside outside assembl nationale calling abortion called question said former presidential candidate october yet several countries recognize abortion legal right recently clamped access procedure without actually banning case poland since several pregnant women died failed get medical pregnancy terminations time france political group currently calling tightening rules governing abortion however french women equal access procedure two minute explainer video monde looks issues surrounding abortion rights france macron wants enshrine right abortion constitution,sunday octob presid emmanuel macron took step toward enshrin right abort french constitut announc bill protect right would present end women freedom recours abort irrevers macron said howev conserv far right leader critic constitut reform accus presid import american debat follow suprem court decis elimin constitut right abort june presid rassembl nation far right marin pen call text total useless polit movement whether insid outsid assembl national call abort call question said former presidenti candid octob yet sever countri recogn abort legal right recent clamp access procedur without actual ban case poland sinc sever pregnant women die fail get medic pregnanc termin time franc polit group current call tighten rule govern abort howev french women equal access procedur two minut explain video mond look issu surround abort right franc macron want enshrin right abort constitut
Germany unveils huge electricity price support package for industry,"    Announcing the deal, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the costs would be worth up to €12 billion in the next year alone. ","Germany announced on Thursday, November 9, a huge relief package including tax cuts on electricity for the manufacturing sector, in a bid to shore up an economy that many fear could end the year in recession. ""In the cIoming year alone, the relief will reach up to €12 billion,"" said Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a statement.In 2024 and 2025, electricity tax will be slashed from the current 1.537 cents per kilowatt to the European Union minimum of 0.05 cents per kilowatt for the manufacturing sector. The lowered tax could be extended for a further three years, said the government in a statement.The most energy-intensive companies most vulnerable to international competition will also have costs related to their emissions trading reimbursed under the package. The agreement on the help package for manufacturers came after weeks of hefty discussions between the industry and the German government.German companies, especially in sectors such as chemical and metal manufacturing, have struggled with a surge in power prices triggered by Russian energy supply cuts in the wake of Moscow's war in Ukraine. The higher electricity costs have undercut German exporters' price competitiveness on the global stage.For months, the economy ministry has been pushing for a cap for industrial power prices – essentially a subsidy on electricity. But the finance ministry had balked at the huge costs and warned against market distortion.Peter Adrian, the head of Germany's association of chambers of industry and commerce, called the package ""overdue"" but said it was ""doubtful if the package will be enough to ensure competitive electricity prices for the entire industry.""""Companies in services and trade too are dependent on affordable electricity prices,"" he noted, saying that there is a ""tinge of bitterness that the electricity tax hasn't been lowered in general to the minimum level"" to benefit all businesses.The German economy shrank slightly in the third quarter, while a string of recent weak economic data has added to fears of a prolonged downturn.

US Fed could hike rates again if 'appropriate',    US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday that the institution was prepared to raise interest rates further if it is needed to bring down inflation to 2%. ,"The US Federal Reserve is prepared, if needed, to hike interest rates further in order to bring inflation down to its long-term two-percent target, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday, November 9.""We know that ongoing progress toward our two percent goal is not assured: Inflation has given us a few head fakes,"" Powell told a conference in Washington in prepared remarks. ""If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so,"" he added.Powell's remarks come just over a week after the US central bank voted to hold its interest rate steady at a 22-year high for the second consecutive meeting, fueling expectations that it was done raising it.While the Fed's rate-setting committee is ""committed"" to achieving a sufficiently tight stance of monetary policy, ""we are not confident that we have achieved such a stance,"" Powell said. The Fed chair's comments suggest the US central bank is still concerned about the possibility of a re-acceleration of inflation, which has more than halved since peaking last year, according to the Fed's favored yardstick.But despite the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening, which brought rates to a level between 5.25-5.50% it recently noted that US economic activity remained strong in the third quarter. It also found that ""job gains have slowed in recent months but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low."" The strong economy has increased the likelihood of a so-called ""soft landing,"" whereby the Fed succeeds in tackling inflation without plunging the United States into recession.Speaking on Wednesday, Powell indicated the Fed would proceed cautiously, ""allowing us to address both the risk of being misled by a few good months of data, and the risk of overtightening.""Futures traders currently assign a probability of more than 90 percent that the Fed will vote to hold interest rates steady at its next rate meeting in December, according to data from CME Group.",Economy,federal reserve prepared needed hike interest rates order bring inflation long term two percent target fed chair jerome powell said thursday november know ongoing progress toward two percent goal assured inflation given head fakes powell told conference washington prepared remarks becomes appropriate tighten policy hesitate added powells remarks come week central bank voted hold interest rate steady year high second consecutive meeting fueling expectations done raising feds rate setting committee committed achieving sufficiently tight stance monetary policy confident achieved stance powell said fed chairs comments suggest central bank still concerned possibility acceleration inflation halved since peaking last year according feds favored yardstick despite feds aggressive monetary tightening brought rates level recently noted economic activity remained strong third quarter also found job gains slowed recent months remain strong unemployment rate remained low strong economy increased likelihood called soft landing whereby fed succeeds tackling inflation without plunging united states recession speaking wednesday powell indicated fed would proceed cautiously allowing address risk misled good months data risk overtightening futures traders currently assign probability percent fed vote hold interest rates steady next rate meeting december according data cme group,feder reserv prepar need hike interest rate order bring inflat long term two percent target fed chair jerom powel said thursday novemb know ongo progress toward two percent goal assur inflat given head fake powel told confer washington prepar remark becom appropri tighten polici hesit ad powel remark come week central bank vote hold interest rate steadi year high second consecut meet fuel expect done rais fed rate set committe commit achiev suffici tight stanc monetari polici confid achiev stanc powel said fed chair comment suggest central bank still concern possibl acceler inflat halv sinc peak last year accord fed favor yardstick despit fed aggress monetari tighten brought rate level recent note econom activ remain strong third quarter also found job gain slow recent month remain strong unemploy rate remain low strong economi increas likelihood call soft land wherebi fed succe tackl inflat without plung unit state recess speak wednesday powel indic fed would proceed cautious allow address risk misl good month data risk overtighten futur trader current assign probabl percent fed vote hold interest rate steadi next rate meet decemb accord data cme group
J.P. Morgan continues its large-scale philanthropy in France's Seine-Saint-Denis,"    Since 2018, the United States' largest bank has made the northeast suburbs of Paris the largest beneficiary of its philanthropic initiatives abroad. CEO Jamie Dimon announced a new five-year commitment on Wednesday, bringing the bank's total support to $50 million. ","In 2018, to mark the 150th anniversary of its presence in France, J.P. Morgan promised via its foundation to allocate $30 million (€26 million at the time) over five years to help the inhabitants of Seine-Saint-Denis ""benefit from new economic opportunities."" On Wednesday, November 8, Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of America's largest bank, announced an additional $20 million in philanthropic commitments over the next five years for the department that is part of the Greater Paris area.In addition, there will be a further $50 million in funds – drawn from the group's capital – intended to finance venture capital funds ""advised by women-led managers"" or ""managers positively impacting society and communities."" This ""superfund,"" entrusted to Bpifrance, is similar to a project launched in 2021 by the American firm in the United States.France is the main beneficiary, outside of the US, of J.P. Morgan's philanthropic actions, without any associated tax deduction. ""We pay a lot of taxes in France, we employ 900 people and we act as a responsible company. We're helping lift the country, and that doesn't just benefit those who are already at the top,"" said Dimon, a fan from the outset of Emmanuel Macron's economic reforms. He had met the French president that very morning.""We wanted to launch a large-scale operation in Paris, similar to what we have been doing in Detroit since 2014,"" explained Peter Scher, J.P. Morgan's vice president in charge of corporate responsibility, speaking with Le Monde. To help put America's automotive capital back on its feet, J.P. Morgan has pledged $200 million over nearly 10 years. ""Detroit and Seine-Saint-Denis are very different places, but our approach is the same: we want to act as a catalyst by supporting the right partners, in conjunction with public stakeholders,"" continued Scher.Around 20 associations active in Seine-Saint-Denis, one of the poorest areas in France but also one of the youngest, have benefited from this support. ""J.P. Morgan has taken an original approach by focusing a lot of resources on one area,"" said Quentin Moreno, deputy managing director of the Sport dans la Ville (""Sport in the City"") association, which aims to help young people who have dropped out of school find work. ""Thanks to the J.P. Morgan Foundation, we have been able to double the number of young people we support in Seine-Saint-Denis.""""We worked closely with J.P. Morgan to design programs to support entrepreneurs in these neighborhoods. We also had to ensure that this economic activity better served the local residents, which is why we focused on the building and public works sector as well as the restaurant industry: two sectors with strong local stakes in terms of employment and the attractiveness of these neighborhoods,"" explained Mathieu Cornieti, director of Impact Partners, an investment fund involved in projects in urban districts.",Economy,mark anniversary presence france morgan promised via foundation allocate million million time five years help inhabitants seine saint denis benefit new economic opportunities wednesday november jamie dimon chairman ceo americas largest bank announced additional million philanthro next five years department part greater paris area addition million funds drawn groups capital intended finance venture capital funds advised women led managers managers positively impacting society communities superfund entrusted bpifrance similar project launched american firm united states france main beneficiary outside morgans philanthro without associated tax deduction pay lot taxes france employ people act responsible company helping lift country doesnt benefit already top said dimon fan outset emmanuel macrons economic reforms met french president morning wanted launch large scale operation paris similar detroit since explained peter scher morgans vice president charge corporate responsibility speaking monde help put americas automotive capital back feet morgan pledged million nearly years detroit seine saint denis different places approach want act catalyst supporting right partners conjunction public stakeholders continued scher around associations active seine saint denis one poorest areas france also one youngest benefited support morgan taken original approach focusing lot resources one area said quentin moreno deputy managing director sport dans ville sport city association aims help young people dropped school find work thanks morgan foundation able double number young people support seine saint denis worked closely morgan design programs support entrepreneurs neighborhoods also ensure economic activity better served local residents focused building public works sector well restaurant industry two sectors strong local stakes terms employment attractiveness neighborhoods explained mathieu cornieti director impact partners investment fund involved projects urban districts,mark anniversari presenc franc morgan promis via foundat alloc million million time five year help inhabit sein saint deni benefit new econom opportun wednesday novemb jami dimon chairman ceo america largest bank announc addit million philanthro next five year depart part greater pari area addit million fund drawn group capit intend financ ventur capit fund advis women led manag manag posit impact societi commun superfund entrust bpifranc similar project launch american firm unit state franc main beneficiari outsid morgan philanthro without associ tax deduct pay lot tax franc employ peopl act respons compani help lift countri doesnt benefit alreadi top said dimon fan outset emmanuel macron econom reform met french presid morn want launch larg scale oper pari similar detroit sinc explain peter scher morgan vice presid charg corpor respons speak mond help put america automot capit back feet morgan pledg million nearli year detroit sein saint deni differ place approach want act catalyst support right partner conjunct public stakehold continu scher around associ activ sein saint deni one poorest area franc also one youngest benefit support morgan taken origin approach focus lot resourc one area said quentin moreno deputi manag director sport dan vill sport citi associ aim help young peopl drop school find work thank morgan foundat abl doubl number young peopl support sein saint deni work close morgan design program support entrepreneur neighborhood also ensur econom activ better serv local resid focus build public work sector well restaur industri two sector strong local stake term employ attract neighborhood explain mathieu cornieti director impact partner invest fund involv project urban district
Thomas Piketty: 'It's time for Western countries to take the BRICS seriously',"    In his column, the French economist argues that a minimum tax should be introduced on the world's most prosperous players, with a redistribution of revenues between all countries, to share power and wealth. ","The war in Gaza threatens to widen the gap between North and South. For many countries in the South, and not only in the Muslim world, the thousands of civilian deaths caused by Israeli bombardments in the Palestinian enclave, 20 years after the tens of thousands of deaths caused by the United States in Iraq, will doubtless embody the West's double standards for a long time to come.All this is taking place against a backdrop in which the main alliance of so-called emerging countries, the BRICS, has just been strengthened at its Johannesburg summit a few months ago. Initially created in 2009, the BRICS have comprised five countries since 2011: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Expressed in terms of purchasing power parity, the combined GDP of these five countries will exceed €40,000 billion by 2022, compared with just €30,000 billion for the G7 countries (United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom and Italy), and €120,000 billion on a global scale (an average of just over €1,000 per month for the world's 8 billion people). Differences in average national income per capita remain considerable, of course: almost €3,000 per month in the G7, less than €1,000 per month in the BRICS and less than €200 per month in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the latest data from the World Inequality Lab.In a few words, the BRICS present themselves to the world as the planet's middle class – those who have succeeded, through hard work, in improving their condition, and who have no intention of stopping there.In 2014, the BRICS created its own development bank. Based in Shanghai, it remains modest in size but could compete with the Bretton Woods institutions (International Monetary Fund and World Bank) in the future if they do not radically reform their voting rights systems to give greater prominence to the countries of the South.At the Johannesburg summit in August, the BRICS decided to welcome six new members (Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia and Iran) from January 1, 2024, reportedly chosen from among some 40 candidate countries.Let's face it: It's time for Western countries to overcome their arrogance and take the BRICS seriously. It's easy to point out the many inconsistencies and contradictions within what remains a loose, largely informal club. China's political model increasingly resembles a perfect digital dictatorship, and no one wants it any more than Russia's military kleptocracy. At least that guarantees the other leaders that the club won't stick its nose in their business.",Economy,war gaza threatens widen gap north south many countries south muslim world thousands civilian deaths caused israeli bombardments palestinian enclave years tens thousands deaths caused united states iraq doubtless embody wests double standards long time come taking place backdrop main alliance called emerging countries brics strengthened johannesburg summit months ago initially created brics comprised five countries since brazil russia india china south africa expressed terms purchasing power parity combined gdp five countries exceed billion compared billion countries united states canada japan germany france united kingdom italy billion global scale average per month worlds billion people differences average national income per capita remain considerable course almost per month less per month brics less per month sub saharan africa according latest data world inequality lab words brics present world planets middle class succeeded hard work improving condition intention stopping brics created development bank based shanghai remains modest size could compete bretton woods institutions international monetary fund world bank future radically reform voting rights systems give greater prominence countries south johannesburg summit august brics decided welcome six new members saudi arabia argentina egypt united arab emirates ethiopia iran january reportedly chosen among candidate countries lets face time western countries overcome arrogance take brics seriously easy point many inconsistencies contradictions within remains loose largely informal club chinas political model increasingly resembles perfect digital dictatorship one wants russias military kleptocracy least guarantees leaders club wont stick nose business,war gaza threaten widen gap north south mani countri south muslim world thousand civilian death caus isra bombard palestinian enclav year ten thousand death caus unit state iraq doubtless embodi west doubl standard long time come take place backdrop main allianc call emerg countri bric strengthen johannesburg summit month ago initi creat bric compris five countri sinc brazil russia india china south africa express term purchas power pariti combin gdp five countri exceed billion compar billion countri unit state canada japan germani franc unit kingdom itali billion global scale averag per month world billion peopl differ averag nation incom per capita remain consider cours almost per month less per month bric less per month sub saharan africa accord latest data world inequ lab word bric present world planet middl class succeed hard work improv condit intent stop bric creat develop bank base shanghai remain modest size could compet bretton wood institut intern monetari fund world bank futur radic reform vote right system give greater promin countri south johannesburg summit august bric decid welcom six new member saudi arabia argentina egypt unit arab emir ethiopia iran januari reportedli chosen among candid countri let face time western countri overcom arrog take bric serious easi point mani inconsist contradict within remain loos larg inform club china polit model increasingli resembl perfect digit dictatorship one want russia militari kleptocraci least guarante leader club wont stick nose busi
Myanmar junta attempts to attract tourists in a quest to bring in foreign currency,"    Tourist operators in France are readily promoting a country under military dictatorship rule since the coup d'état of February 1, 2021. ","Despite being under a military dictatorship, where almost 20,000 political prisoners are locked up, most of them tortured, Myanmar is also a ""world of light, art, living legends and a new-found serenity,"" according to the website of Paris-based cultural travel agency Clio. This agency is organizing a trip there in January 2024 including on the itinerary a visit to Pagan and its ""10,000 pagodas"" and a trip on the Irrawaddy River.Almost three years after the military coup of February 1, 2021, which overthrew Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, the junta is attempting to attract tourists from around the world as part of its quest to bring in foreign currency. In the 2022-2023 tax year that ended in March, the country gave out almost 370,000 tourist visas, up 187% on the previous year. Most of these visitors came from China, Russia, India and the Middle East. This figure is still a far cry from the four million tourists welcomed each year before the Covid-19 pandemic struck.At the IFTM-Top Resa trade show held in Paris at the start of October, tourism agencies at the Thai pavilion – there was no Myanmar stand –discreetly promoted Myanmar. The French federation Les Entreprises du voyage even published photos of the country on social media, before taking them down without any explanation.The French NGO Info Birmanie was concerned that this promotion of tourism ""normalizes the situation in the country while legitimizing the junta,"" according to its coordinator, Johanna Chardonnieras, who was must upset at an article published by Le Figaro on February 19 entitled ""When's a good time to go to Myanmar in terms of weather and climate...? The best times to go for each region.""In March, the NGO lodged a complaint with the French journalistic council for ethics and mediation [Conseil de déontologie journalistique et de médiation], denouncing the ""range of advertising propaganda currently deployed by the military junta with a view to making a tourist destination out of a country in chaos."" The complaint was eventually declared unfounded, and Le Figaro added a paragraph of context on the 2021 coup d'état, specifying that any travel there was ""not recommended."" ""This article is one of a long list of generic publications aiming simply to offer practical advice, such as the best dates for vacations in as many destinations around the world as possible,"" explained Marc Feuillée, General Manager of the Le Figaro Group, adding that the article ""was not commissioned by any tourist office.""",Economy,despite military dictatorship almost political prisoners locked tortured myanmar also world light art living legends new found serenity according website paris based cultural travel agency clio agency organizing trip january including itinerary visit pagan pagodas trip irrawaddy river almost three years military coup february overthrew nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi junta attempting attract tourists around world part quest bring foreign currency tax year ended march country gave almost tourist visas previous year visitors came china russia india middle east figure still far cry four million tourists welcomed year covid pandemic struck iftm top resa trade show held paris start october tourism agencies thai pavilion myanmar stand discreetly promoted myanmar french federation les entreprises voyage even published photos country social media taking without explanation french ngo info birmanie concerned promotion tourism normalizes situation country legitimizing junta according coordinator johanna chardonnieras must upset article published figaro february entitled whens good time myanmar terms weather climate best times region march ngo lodged complaint french journalistic council ethics mediation conseil ontologie journalistique diation denouncing range advertising propaganda currently deployed military junta view making tourist destination country chaos complaint eventually declared unfounded figaro added paragraph context coup tat specifying travel recommended article one long list generic publications aiming simply offer practical advice best dates vacations many destinations around world possible explained marc feuill general manager figaro group adding article commissioned tourist office,despit militari dictatorship almost polit prison lock tortur myanmar also world light art live legend new found seren accord websit pari base cultur travel agenc clio agenc organ trip januari includ itinerari visit pagan pagoda trip irrawaddi river almost three year militari coup februari overthrew nobel peac prize winner aung san suu kyi junta attempt attract tourist around world part quest bring foreign currenc tax year end march countri gave almost tourist visa previou year visitor came china russia india middl east figur still far cri four million tourist welcom year covid pandem struck iftm top resa trade show held pari start octob tourism agenc thai pavilion myanmar stand discreetli promot myanmar french feder le entrepris voyag even publish photo countri social media take without explan french ngo info birmani concern promot tourism normal situat countri legitim junta accord coordin johanna chardonniera must upset articl publish figaro februari entitl when good time myanmar term weather climat best time region march ngo lodg complaint french journalist council ethic mediat conseil ontologi journalistiqu diation denounc rang advertis propaganda current deploy militari junta view make tourist destin countri chao complaint eventu declar unfound figaro ad paragraph context coup tat specifi travel recommend articl one long list gener public aim simpli offer practic advic best date vacat mani destin around world possibl explain marc feuill gener manag figaro group ad articl commiss tourist offic
Prince Harry wins in latest round of UK media litigation,"    The case for 'unlawful information gathering,' brought against British tabloid publishers by the former royal and others, was ruled 'a worthwhile claim', and could go to trial. ","The publishers of two UK newspapers on Friday, November 10, lost a bid to have a case for unlawful information gathering brought against them by Prince Harry and others thrown out of court, opening the way for a possible trial.Lawyers for Associated Newspapers (ANL) – publishers of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday – had argued that the claims were brought too late. But in a written ruling, Judge Matthew Nicklin disagreed and said the case could go ahead.The ruling is the latest chapter in Harry's turbulent relationship with the press, whom he holds responsible for the death of his mother Princess Diana in a 1997 Paris car crash as she fled paparazzi. Other claimants are pop star Elton John, his husband David Furnish, the actors Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, politician Simon Hughes, and Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was killed in a racist murder in 1993.ANL had ""not been able to deliver a 'knockout blow' to the claims of any of these claimants,"" the judge said in his 95-page ruling. ""In my judgment, each claimant has a real prospect of demonstrating that Associated [...] concealed from him/her the relevant facts upon which a worthwhile claim of unlawful information gathering could have been advanced,"" he wrote.Harry and the other claimants accuse ANL of methods such as hiring private investigators, tapping phone calls and impersonating individuals to obtain medical information for articles. The court has been told the alleged wrongdoing dates back to 1993 and continued to as late as 2018. ANL has dismissed the allegations, arguing the case should not go to trial.Harry, 39, and his wife Meghan, 42, quit royal duties in 2020 and relocated to California, in part blaming media attention for the move. The prince, who is formally known as the Duke of Sussex and is the younger son of King Charles III, has vowed to make reforming the British media his life's mission.

"Living in low-income housing in upmarket Paris: 'Once you're here, everything changes'",    Some of the capital's public housing tenants live in neighborhoods with unmet social diversity quotas and where local residents are sometimes reluctant to welcome newcomers. ,"She was everywhere that evening. On September 14, as the Paris municipal team inaugurated the transformation of former Ministry of the Armed Forces offices into public housing in the very chic 7th arrondissement to the sound of a small brass band, Rachida Dati (Les Républicains, LR, center right), the arrondissement's mayor, was in every selfie. There were hugs, broad smiles, a word for everyone and an impromptu photo in the middle of the orchestra. It would have been hard to guess that in 2017, she hadn't backed this unprecedented project to add 254 social housing units on this exceptional site, located a few steps from the Assemblée Nationale.At the arrondissement council meeting, she lamented that most of these housing units would not be allocated to residents of the 7th because their incomes were too high. Citing the example of a similar operation to create social housing on the remarkable site of the former Laennec hospital, she deplored having to ""regularly police it."" ""When owners bought their homes for €10,000, €15,000 or €20,000 per square meter, and someone living across the street is throwing things over the balcony, or the common areas are not respected, the residents feel cheated at having saved up to find themselves in a situation of permanent conflict,"" Dati declared.A few days later, at the December 2017 Paris council, her deputy, Emmanuelle Dauvergne, voted against the project because it included too many ""very social"" housing units. Worrying about ""the ghettoization of entire buildings in the heart of Paris,"" she said the initiative ""would destabilize the neighborhood, our schools and our local businesses.""Six years later, there was a joyful fairground atmosphere in the cobbled courtyard, where the children of the many tenants had gathered to celebrate their move-in. The band's brass instruments contrasted with the calm of Rue Saint-Dominique and its art galleries.The French Ministry of the Armed Forces had agreed to set aside around 50 housing units for its troops. Among them, 43-year-old Valérie (all those mentioned by their first names wished to remain anonymous), a soldier previously based in Lyon, was delighted to find herself on this chic area, ""especially for its security. I'll have peace of mind for my children.""Kuthubkhan, a restaurant owner originally from Sri Lanka; his wife; and their two children were able to leave their one-bedroom apartment in the 10th arrondissement's social housing stock for a three-room apartment in a neighborhood where he expects ""the schools to be better."" Sandrine (her first name was changed), a victim of domestic violence for several years, was given a three-bedroom apartment quickly after submitting her application. ""For me, a new life is starting. I've been free for two weeks now,"" she said. ""The neighborhood is incredible. We're surrounded by monuments. It's a privilege, and I wasn't asking for this much. I'm living a daydream.""",Economy,everywhere evening september paris municipal team inaugurated transformation former ministry armed forces offices public housing chic arrondissement sound small brass band rachida dati les publicains center right arrondissements mayor every selfie hugs broad smiles word everyone impromptu photo middle orchestra would hard guess hadnt backed unprecedented project add social housing units exceptional site located steps assembl nationale arrondissement council meeting lamented housing units would allocated residents incomes high citing example similar operation create social housing remarkable site former laennec hospital deplored regularly police owners bought homes per square meter someone living across street throwing things balcony common areas respected residents feel cheated saved find situation permanent conflict dati declared days later december paris council deputy emmanuelle dauvergne voted project included many social housing units worrying ghettoization entire buildings heart paris said initiative would destabilize neighborhood schools local businesses six years later joyful fairground atmosphere cobbled courtyard children many tenants gathered celebrate move bands brass instruments contrasted calm rue saint dominique art galleries french ministry armed forces agreed set aside around housing units troops among year old val rie mentioned first names wished remain anonymous soldier previously based lyon delighted find chic area especially security ill peace mind children kuthubkhan restaurant owner originally sri lanka wife two children able leave one bedroom apartment arrondissements social housing stock three room apartment neighborhood expects schools better sandrine first name changed victim domestic violence several years given three bedroom apartment quickly submitting application new life starting ive free two weeks said neighborhood incredible surrounded monuments privilege wasnt asking much living daydream,everywher even septemb pari municip team inaugur transform former ministri arm forc offic public hous chic arrondiss sound small brass band rachida dati le publicain center right arrondiss mayor everi selfi hug broad smile word everyon impromptu photo middl orchestra would hard guess hadnt back unpreced project add social hous unit except site locat step assembl national arrondiss council meet lament hous unit would alloc resid incom high cite exampl similar oper creat social hous remark site former laennec hospit deplor regularli polic owner bought home per squar meter someon live across street throw thing balconi common area respect resid feel cheat save find situat perman conflict dati declar day later decemb pari council deputi emmanuel dauvergn vote project includ mani social hous unit worri ghettoiz entir build heart pari said initi would destabil neighborhood school local busi six year later joy fairground atmospher cobbl courtyard children mani tenant gather celebr move band brass instrument contrast calm rue saint dominiqu art galleri french ministri arm forc agre set asid around hous unit troop among year old val rie mention first name wish remain anonym soldier previous base lyon delight find chic area especi secur ill peac mind children kuthubkhan restaur owner origin sri lanka wife two children abl leav one bedroom apart arrondiss social hous stock three room apart neighborhood expect school better sandrin first name chang victim domest violenc sever year given three bedroom apart quickli submit applic new life start ive free two week said neighborhood incred surround monument privileg wasnt ask much live daydream
'Joe Biden's economic record is not a good enough argument for the Democrats to win the next election',"    As the incumbent US president prepares to run for a second term, Americans are not convinced that the Biden administration has improved their lives, despite flattering macroeconomic data, Stéphane Lauer writes. ","A slogan does not a track record make. Joe Biden is learning this the hard way. For several months, the US president has been criss-crossing the country to tout ""Bidenomics,"" a generic name he has appropriated to refer to the economic policies he has been pursuing for almost three years. But as he prepares to run for a second term, the White House's after-sales service is struggling to convince Americans that Biden has improved their lives, despite flattering macroeconomic data.After the shock of Covid-19, growth rebounded faster than elsewhere, and it continues to accelerate. No country has been spared from inflation, but it is slowing faster in the US. As for unemployment, the rate was 6.3% when Biden arrived at the White House. Three years later, that rate has been almost halved and 14 million jobs have been created – an unprecedented figure for a single term in office.Yet voters tend to see the glass as half empty. Two-thirds disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy. An ABC News-Washington Post poll indicates that a third of voters consider the jobs situation to be poor. According to a Yahoo!-Ipsos survey, only 21% of Americans feel that results are better than in other developed countries. Finally, two out of three don't believe inflation is coming down.""Even if the United States is doing well, 'Bidenomics' isn't making an impression on the population, and that's a disaster for the Democrats,"" said Laurence Nardon, a researcher at the Institut Français des Relations Internationales and author of a memo on Biden's economic policy. The president may perceive a certain ingratitude on the part of his compatriots, after he launched a vast program of investment and financial support for the middle class. He has taken protectionist measures to revive industryand helped trade unions, which are seen as the best way of improving living standards for wage earners. The aim is to close the liberal parenthesis that was begun under Ronald Reagan and restart social mobility, in order to turn voters away from the populist temptation of Donald Trump.A poll published in early November by the New York Times confirms that anything could happen: With a year to go before the election, Trump would win with a substantial lead in five out of six key states. Only 2% of those surveyed consider the economic situation to be good. One of the survey's findings is that voters are more concerned about inflation than jobs, while feeling that Democrats are focusing more on jobs.",Economy,slogan track record make joe biden learning hard way several months president criss crossing country tout bidenomics generic name appropriated refer economic policies pursuing almost three years prepares run second term white houses sales service struggling convince americans biden improved lives despite flattering macroeconomic data shock covid growth rebounded faster elsewhere continues accelerate country spared inflation slowing faster unemployment rate biden arrived white house three years later rate almost halved million jobs created unprecedented figure single term office yet voters tend see glass half empty two thirds disapprove bidens handling economy abc news washington post poll indicates third voters consider jobs situation poor according yahoo ipsos survey americans feel results better developed countries finally two three dont believe inflation coming even united states well bidenomics isnt making impression population thats disaster democrats said laurence nardon researcher institut fran ais des relations internationales author memo bidens economic policy president may perceive certain ingratitude part compatriots launched vast program investment financial support middle class taken protectionist measures revive industryand helped trade unions seen best way improving living standards wage earners aim close liberal parenthesis begun ronald reagan restart social mobility order turn voters away populist temptation donald trump poll published early november new york times confirms anything could happen year election trump would win substantial lead five six key states surveyed consider economic situation good one surveys findings voters concerned inflation jobs feeling democrats focusing jobs,slogan track record make joe biden learn hard way sever month presid criss cross countri tout bidenom gener name appropri refer econom polici pursu almost three year prepar run second term white hous sale servic struggl convinc american biden improv live despit flatter macroeconom data shock covid growth rebound faster elsewher continu acceler countri spare inflat slow faster unemploy rate biden arriv white hous three year later rate almost halv million job creat unpreced figur singl term offic yet voter tend see glass half empti two third disapprov biden handl economi abc news washington post poll indic third voter consid job situat poor accord yahoo ipso survey american feel result better develop countri final two three dont believ inflat come even unit state well bidenom isnt make impress popul that disast democrat said laurenc nardon research institut fran ai de relat international author memo biden econom polici presid may perceiv certain ingratitud part compatriot launch vast program invest financi support middl class taken protectionist measur reviv industryand help trade union seen best way improv live standard wage earner aim close liber parenthesi begun ronald reagan restart social mobil order turn voter away populist temptat donald trump poll publish earli novemb new york time confirm anyth could happen year elect trump would win substanti lead five six key state survey consid econom situat good one survey find voter concern inflat job feel democrat focus job
IMF managing director Georgieva: 'We have placed too much emphasis on the benefits of globalization',"    Kristalina Georgieva, in an inteview with Le Monde, expresses concern about the risk of the global economy fragmenting and rising geopolitical threats. ","While inflation is finally easing, the Middle East crisis and geopolitical risks could once again push up oil prices, warns Kristalina Georgieva. While visiting Paris from November 9 to 11, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spoke with Le Monde. She warned of the risk of fragmentation of world trade, which she believes is likely to increase poverty and insecurity for all.For a long time, we have placed too much emphasis on the benefits of globalization. They have been considerable: Over the last three decades, the global economy has tripled, in particular to the benefit of developing economies which have quadrupled, and the result has been an incredible reduction in poverty.But not everyone benefited from it. For too long, insufficient attention has been paid to those whose jobs and livelihoods have evaporated, because compensation mechanisms have been insufficient. This has created fertile ground for anti-globalization movements and populism.Worse, since the pandemic, we have witnessed a series of exogenous shocks that lead to massive interruptions in supply chains. This may push companies to want to bring part of their production closer together. But this is not without problems because it concentrates the risks in the same place in the event of a new shock.We cannot return to the past model, in which too many people lost out, and which does not sufficiently recognize that the security of supplies is also a question of economic security and not only national security. We need to rethink globalization as much as possible in collaboration with our partners. Our advice for countries is to not play the national interest card against others, but think about mechanisms to continue global integration and balance risks. Because greater fragmentation of global trade would have a very clear consequence: We would all be poorer and less secure.Depending on the scenarios, it could amount to between 0.2% and 7% of global gross domestic product (GDP). Seven percent, the extreme case, would be equivalent to excluding two countries like Germany and Japan from the global economy. To limit this risk, we must resist the temptation to impose trade barriers, the number of which has increased from around 500 in 2017 to 1000 in 2019 to 3000 in 2022.However, our research shows that if one of the three major economies in the world, the United States, Europe, China, takes a fundamentally protectionist measure, the probability that a partner country will take a protectionist measure in response is 73% within 12 months.

Sixty European banks suspected of influencing tensions in South Sudan,"    The NGO Global Witness accused Deutsche Bank, Alliance, ING, and five major French financial establishments of financing two Chinese and Malaysian oil groups implicated in violence affecting the African country in the grip of civil war since 2013. ","Sixty European banks, insurance companies and investment firms have directly or indirectly financed two international oil groups implicated in violence in South Sudan, the non-governmental organization Global Witness, which specializes in the impact of natural resource exploitation on the environment and human rights, has claimed.Among the names singled out in the report published on Tuesday, November 14, are those of German groups Deutsche Bank and Allianz, Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo, the Netherlands' Aegon and ING, and France's BNP Paribas, BPCE, Crédit Agricole, Crédit Mutuel CIC and Société Générale.The NGO has identified more than €700 million in direct or indirect shareholdings by these European financial institutions in the oil group China National Petroleum Company (CNPC), the Malaysian company Petronas, and their listed subsidiaries, as well as €4 billion in loans and commissions received from bond issues by the two companies.Global Witness has accused CNPC and Petronas of encouraging intermittent violence in South Sudan, which has been independent since 2011 and, since 2013, has been in the grip of a civil war that has led, according to the United Nations, to the deaths of several hundred thousand people and the displacement of around 4 million people.Petronas is a shareholder in South Sudan's three major crude oil producers, Dar Petroleum Operating Company (DPOC), Greater Pioneer Operating Company (GPOC) and Sudd Petroleum Operating Company. Although the Malaysian oil company announced in December 2022 that it would sell its interests to the UK's Savannah Energy, the sale has not yet taken place, and the Chinese company CNPC still has a stake in DPOC and GPOC. Since 2018, Sudan's three oil companies have been on the list of entities that the United States deemed likely to pose a threat to national security.At the time, the US Commerce Department concluded that these companies represented a significant source of revenue ""to fund the purchase of weapons and other material that undermine the peace, security and stability"" of South Sudan.Global Witness hopes that the financial groups cited will be able to change the way they do business, but also intends to put pressure on European politicians who are debating the inclusion of the financial sector within the scope of the CSDD directive on corporate sustainability due diligence.BPCE denied that they are financing the companies in a reply to Global Witness. CIC said it has had no business relationship with Petronas since 2019 and stated that it never participated in financing activities in South Sudan, while Crédit Agricole said it has not financed Petronas ""for several years."" BNP Paribas and Société Générale made no comment on their relations with specific companies, but the former explained that Petronas is concerned by its strategy of exiting from fossil fuels, in other words: the bank could exclude the oil group from its investments. BNP said it applies ""a strict framework to the management of environmental and social risks.""",Economy,sixty european banks insurance companies investment firms directly indirectly financed two international oil groups implicated violence south sudan non governmental organization global witness specializes impact natural resource exploitation environment human rights claimed among names singled report published tuesday november german groups deutsche bank allianz italys intesa sanpaolo netherlands aegon ing frances bnp paribas bpce dit agricole dit mutuel cic soci rale ngo identified million direct indirect shareholdings european financial institutions oil group china national petroleum company cnpc malaysian company petronas listed subsidiaries well billion loans commissions received bond issues two companies global witness accused cnpc petronas encouraging intermittent violence south sudan independent since since grip civil war led according united nations deaths several hundred thousand people displacement around million people petronas shareholder south sudans three major crude oil producers dar petroleum operating company dpoc greater pioneer operating company gpoc sudd petroleum operating company although malaysian oil company announced december would sell interests uks savannah energy sale yet taken place chinese company cnpc still stake dpoc gpoc since sudans three oil companies list entities united states deemed likely pose threat national security time commerce department concluded companies represented significant source revenue fund purchase weapons material undermine peace security stability south sudan global witness hopes financial groups cited able change way business also intends put pressure european politicians debating inclusion financial sector within scope csdd directive corporate sustainability due diligence bpce denied financing companies reply global witness cic said business relationship petronas since stated never participated financing activities south sudan dit agricole said financed petronas several years bnp paribas soci rale made comment relations specific companies former explained petronas concerned strategy exiting fossil fuels words bank could exclude oil group investments bnp said applies strict framework management environmental social risks,sixti european bank insur compani invest firm directli indirectli financ two intern oil group implic violenc south sudan non government organ global wit special impact natur resourc exploit environ human right claim among name singl report publish tuesday novemb german group deutsch bank allianz itali intesa sanpaolo netherland aegon ing franc bnp pariba bpce dit agricol dit mutuel cic soci rale ngo identifi million direct indirect sharehold european financi institut oil group china nation petroleum compani cnpc malaysian compani petrona list subsidiari well billion loan commiss receiv bond issu two compani global wit accus cnpc petrona encourag intermitt violenc south sudan independ sinc sinc grip civil war led accord unit nation death sever hundr thousand peopl displac around million peopl petrona sharehold south sudan three major crude oil produc dar petroleum oper compani dpoc greater pioneer oper compani gpoc sudd petroleum oper compani although malaysian oil compani announc decemb would sell interest uk savannah energi sale yet taken place chines compani cnpc still stake dpoc gpoc sinc sudan three oil compani list entiti unit state deem like pose threat nation secur time commerc depart conclud compani repres signific sourc revenu fund purchas weapon materi undermin peac secur stabil south sudan global wit hope financi group cite abl chang way busi also intend put pressur european politician debat inclus financi sector within scope csdd direct corpor sustain due dilig bpce deni financ compani repli global wit cic said busi relationship petrona sinc state never particip financ activ south sudan dit agricol said financ petrona sever year bnp pariba soci rale made comment relat specif compani former explain petrona concern strategi exit fossil fuel word bank could exclud oil group invest bnp said appli strict framework manag environment social risk
Paris will have residents vote on increasing parking fees for heavy SUVs,"    The vote, to be held in February, will be the second city-wide referendum on urban matters, after residents in April voted to ban rental e-scooters from the capital. ","The city of Paris will ask residents to vote on a plan to increase parking fees for heavy SUVs, Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Tuesday, March 14.City hall said in a statement that the overall space taken up by cars had diminished thanks to its ""determined action"" but that the average size and weight of cars had gone up. The vote, to be held in February, will be the second city-wide referendum on urban matters, after residents in April voted to ban rental e-scooters from the capital. Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) can weigh 2,700 kilos or more, around a third more than regular automobiles.""They're accident-prone, heavy, bulky and polluting,"" the mayor's office said, and had been identified as ""the cause of many problems in the public space."" Quoted in the statement, Hidalgo said the fee increase would be ""very significant."" She did not, however, give a figure, or say what weight threshold would make an SUV ""heavy.""If the vote goes in favor of the fee hike, it would not concern SUV owners with residential parking permits issued by the city. The mayor's office said it hoped to send ""a message"" to auto companies inciting them to stop ""their race to gigantism that is unsuitable to quality of life in the city.""This, it said, would ""allow an improved sharing of public spaces in favor of clean mobility, streets with schools and pedestrians."" SUVs accounted for 49% of new passenger car sales in the European Union last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.In April, Parisians voted overwhelmingly to banish for-hire electric scooters from the streets of the French capital. Turnout for the referendum was 100,000, representing just under 7.5% of the capital's registered voters.",Economy,city paris ask residents vote plan increase parking fees heavy suvs mayor anne hidalgo said tuesday march city hall said statement overall space taken cars diminished thanks determined action average size weight cars gone vote held february second city wide referendum urban matters residents april voted ban rental scooters capital sport utility vehicles suvs weigh kilos around third regular automobiles theyre accident prone heavy bulky polluting mayors office said identified cause many problems public space quoted statement hidalgo said fee increase would significant however give figure say weight threshold would make suv heavy vote goes favor fee hike would concern suv owners residential parking permits issued city mayors office said hoped send message auto companies inciting stop race gigantism unsuitable quality life city said would allow improved sharing public spaces favor clean mobility streets schools pedestrians suvs accounted new passenger car sales european union last year according european automobile manufacturers association april parisians voted overwhelmingly banish hire electric scooters streets french capital turnout referendum representing capitals registered voters,citi pari ask resid vote plan increas park fee heavi suv mayor ann hidalgo said tuesday march citi hall said statement overal space taken car diminish thank determin action averag size weight car gone vote held februari second citi wide referendum urban matter resid april vote ban rental scooter capit sport util vehicl suv weigh kilo around third regular automobil theyr accid prone heavi bulki pollut mayor offic said identifi caus mani problem public space quot statement hidalgo said fee increas would signific howev give figur say weight threshold would make suv heavi vote goe favor fee hike would concern suv owner residenti park permit issu citi mayor offic said hope send messag auto compani incit stop race gigant unsuit qualiti life citi said would allow improv share public space favor clean mobil street school pedestrian suv account new passeng car sale european union last year accord european automobil manufactur associ april parisian vote overwhelmingli banish hire electr scooter street french capit turnout referendum repres capit regist voter
'The Indian New Year is also a time for economic hope',"The good economic health of the world's fifth-largest economy stands in stark contrast with the latest Chinese figures, which show a significant decline in consumption and exports.","On Sunday, November 12, India turned on the lights. Or rather, millions of lights. Thus began Diwali, the festival celebrating the victory of light over darkness. It's Indian Christmas, celebrated over five days when people give each other gifts and wish each other all the best for the coming New Year. The first gift, of interest only to economists and politicians, will be the publication of October's inflation rate.This should confirm the decline in price rises, which had reached 7% in July before receding in the following months and should, according to analysts, hover around 4.8%, close to the 4% target the central bank had set itself. It was therefore right not to raise rates, believing that the rise was temporary, due to the monsoon disasters.The new Indian era also opens with a piece of news that is exciting to the whole subcontinent: The country has qualified for the semi-finals of the World Cricket Championship, which will take place in India. India will take on New Zealand, while Australia will face South Africa. The country's former ruler, England, has thus bitten the dust, which is not to the displeasure of the Indian in the street.But this Indian New Year is also one of great economic hope. Its economic growth is the strongest of any major country. Its gross domestic product has risen from $2,000 billion (€1,871 billion) in 2014 to $3,750 billion in 2023. As the world's fifth-largest economy, it has not only overtaken the United Kingdom in cricket. Its demographics and youthful population, coupled with strong investment in infrastructure and digital technology, have created the conditions for exceptional momentum. Added to this are reforms in taxation, banking and the opening up of markets. Its global successes in digital services and pharmaceuticals could well be enriched by the development of an alternative industrial base for a China neglected by the West.All this contrasts strangely with the latest Chinese figures, which have marked a dramatic slowdown in consumption and exports. Deflation is threatening in a country aging at great speed. But, as in cricket, the match will be very long and unpredictable. The Indian team will have to fight its old demons: endemic corruption, a failing education system, an archaic social structure and an increasingly authoritarian political regime.

"In Abidjan, Ivorians want to 'decolonize' chocolate",Feature,"The Bushman Café in Abidjan always smells like cocoa, but its perfume was particularly potent one day in the small meeting room on the first floor. A few petroleum-black chocolate discs were laid out on trays, offered for tasting to the dozen or so privileged guests who had been invited by Alain Kablan Porquet, the establishment's owner and an artisan chocolatier at the head of the Cocoaïan cooperative.But be careful, you don't bite into a 92% cocoa chocolate like an industrial chocolate bar. ""Put the chocolate in your mouth and crunch very lightly to release the flavors,"" said Kristen Hard, a multi-award-winning American chocolatier and CEO of the high-end boutique Cacao Atlanta. ""Then let it melt on your tongue. You can inhale at the same time to fully take in the flavors."" With a solemnity similar to a wine tasting, one after the other, invitees tasted Ghanaian and Ivorian chocolates, from FairAfric and Cocoaïan, whose cocoa content amounts to 75 or 92%.These little discs, with their delicate notes of flowers or fruit, are the first samples of a greater ambition: transforming a cocoa-producing nation into a chocolate-producing nation. The paradox is well known: Côte d'Ivoire alone supplies 45% of the world cocoa market, but half the beans are exported raw and almost all the rest in the form of semi-processed products.There are only 24 chocolate makers in Côte d'Ivoire, half as many in Ghana. To expand the market – Porquet aims to increase their numbers tenfold over the next few years – he brought together Ghanaian and Ivorian players in the cocoa industry from November 2 to 4, just as the Salon du Chocolat was coming to a close in Paris. The immediate goal was to create a new, specifically African chocolate competition, the World Chocolate Initiative Competition, which is scheduled to be held for the first time in mid-2024.Ultimately, the aim is to launch a debate on the chocolate production standards set by European markets and to usher in a new era of cocoa production, in which power would return to producer countries. This comes at a time when the price of brown gold broke new records on the London and New York stock exchanges on October 30, thanks to the current quarter's poor harvest, which could turn out to be almost 30% less than last year's.""Chocolate is not a consumer product,"" thundered Gauz on the low sofa reserved for the invited speakers at the Bushman Café. ""It's pure thought, pure intellect! It's culture!"" In front of a small audience of journalists, industrialists and researchers, the Ivorian writer, author of the book Cocoaïans (2022), said angrily: ""Cocoa is not a native plant. It was imposed on us by a European bourgeois whim. Cocoa is an issue of civilizational thought, the site of a confrontation between African peasants, who produce this cocoa while destroying their ecosystem, and the hyper-bourgeoisie, who invented the taste of chocolate and imposed it through violence.""The 2.4 million tons of cocoa that leave the fields of Côte d'Ivoire every year are described by Gauz as ""2.4 tons of misfortune!"" ""The first crime we committed – a collective one – was to have perpetuated the colonial economic system. Coffee, cocoa, rubber, palm oil ... there's nothing new being produced here! This is the idea that needs to be put back at the heart of the debate. We need to rethink a class relationship, a relationship of domination.""To reverse this relationship, Porquet advocates for ""the non-nomadization of food."" Between two workshops, he settled into a corner of the Bushman Café, on a Louis XV armchair said to have belonged to Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. ""We want everything to be made locally,"" he explained, ""like wine or haute couture. We can move away from the role of supplier of raw materials and market a high-quality finished product, for both local use and for export.""This is because he is convinced that the alkalinization systematically practiced by chocolate manufacturers ""kills"" cocoa. ""Potash is designed to level out the taste. It removes bitterness, astringency and acidity. But if there's a need for that, it's because there was a fermentation problem from the start!"" His intention is to buy freshly harvested cocoa pods directly from farmers in Ivory Coast so that he can do the shelling, fermentation and drying himself. The producer saves time and money (Cocoaïan buys the beans above the fixed minimum price), and the chocolate maker retains control over his raw material from the outset. In other words, the Cocoaïan company is able to produce ""fine cocoa"" from Forastero pods, the variety grown in West Africa.The Ivorian chocolate maker has seized on a fermentation method invented by Dutch consultant Albertus Eskes, a former researcher at the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD, International Agronomic Research Cooperation Center), who, by his own admission, was ""married to cocoa for 53 years."" His ""Anima"" technique, developed in Brazil from 2015 to 2019 and recently applied by some producers, including Cocoaïan, eliminates bitterness and astringency from the bean without artificial alkalinization, but with guaranteed effectiveness on any cocoa variety. It's a simple, inexpensive method,"" confirmed Eskes. ""It can be applied by any farmer, anywhere in the world, without the addition of laboratory-grown yeasts, but simply with crates of fruit.""Far from wanting to protect their secret, Porquet and Eskes invited government representatives to convince them to deploy the method on a large scale. Beyond the competition, the aim is to establish national certification for cocoa production, based on the implementation of Anima fermentation. The Conseil Café-Cacao (CCC, Coffee-Cocoa Council) was present on the first day for discussions behind closed doors, and the CNRA on the following days.Enthusiastic cocoa breeder and CNRA research coordinator Mathias Tahi plans to meet with the CCC soon to share his observations and, perhaps, launch a nationwide public-private partnership. ""The world needs to know about Côte d'Ivoire's great capacity to produce quality cocoa,"" he said. ""For us, it's a niche market that's opening up, with far greater added value for the entire industry."" The certification also involves a small revolution: full price transparency. Farmers will know the price at which the chocolate produced from their beans is sold.""",Economy,bushman caf abidjan always smells like cocoa perfume particularly potent one day small meeting room

L'Huillier is only the fifth woman to receive the high honor. ,"On Tuesday, October 3, the Nobel Prize in Physics 2023 was awarded jointly to French researcher Pierre Agostini, French-Swedish atomic physics professor Anne L'Huillier and Austrian-Hungarian physicist Ferenc Krausz.They were rewarded for their work on attosecond physics, which enables the creation of ""really short laser pulses that allow you to follow the super-fast movement of electrons inside molecules,"" explained Lars Brostrom, science specialist with Swedish public broadcaster SR. The attosecond is currently the smallest measurable unit of time (one billionth of a billionth of a second).L'Huillier had already won the prestigious Wolf Prize in 2022, sometimes a precursor to the Nobel Prize, along with Krausz and Canadian physicist Paul Corkum.Before L'Huillier, only four women had won the Nobel Prize in Physics since it was first given out in 1901: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018) and Andrea Ghez (2020).Prior to Tuesday's announcement, three of the last six Nobel Prizes in Physics were awarded to physicists working ""in astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology,"" noted Physics World magazine, which considered it unlikely that the work associated with the discoveries of the James Webb Space Telescope would be rewarded this year.Last year, the Swedish Academy awarded the prize to Alain Aspect (French), John Clauser (American) and Anton Zeilinger (Austrian), pioneers of the revolutionary mechanisms of quantum physics.",Science,tuesday october nobel prize physics awarded jointly french researcher pierre agostini french swedish atomic physics professor anne lhuillier austrian hungarian physicist ferenc krausz rewarded work attosecond physics enables creation really short laser pulses allow follow super fast movement electrons inside molecules explained lars brostrom science specialist swedish public broadcaster attosecond currently smallest measurable unit time one billionth billionth second lhuillier already prestigious wolf prize sometimes precursor nobel prize along krausz canadian physicist paul corkum lhuillier four women nobel prize physics since first given marie curie maria goeppert mayer donna strickland andrea ghez prior tuesdays announcement three last six nobel prizes physics awarded physicists working astronomy astrophysics cosmology noted physics world magazine considered unlikely work associated discoveries james webb space telescope would rewarded year last year swedish academy awarded prize alain aspect french john clauser american anton zeilinger austrian pioneers revolutionary mechanisms quantum physics,tuesday octob nobel prize physic award jointli french research pierr agostini french swedish atom physic professor ann lhuillier austrian hungarian physicist ferenc krausz reward work attosecond physic enabl creation realli short laser puls allow follow super fast movement electron insid molecul explain lar brostrom scienc specialist swedish public broadcast attosecond current smallest measur unit time one billionth billionth second lhuillier alreadi prestigi wolf prize sometim precursor nobel prize along krausz canadian physicist paul corkum lhuillier four women nobel prize physic sinc first given mari curi maria goeppert mayer donna strickland andrea ghez prior tuesday announc three last six nobel prize physic award physicist work astronomi astrophys cosmolog note physic world magazin consid unlik work associ discoveri jame webb space telescop would reward year last year swedish academi award prize alain aspect french john clauser american anton zeiling austrian pioneer revolutionari mechan quantum physic
US TV provider given first-ever space debris fine,"    The Federal Communications Commission came down on Dish for 'failure to properly deorbit' a satellite called EchoStar-7, in orbit since 2002. ","US authorities have issued a ""breakthrough"" first-ever fine over space debris, officials said on Tuesday, October 3, slapping a $150,000 penalty on a TV company that failed to properly dispose of a satellite.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) came down on Dish for ""failure to properly deorbit"" a satellite called EchoStar-7, in orbit since 2002.""This marks a first in space debris enforcement by the Commission, which has stepped up its satellite policy efforts,"" the FCC, which authorizes space-based telecom services, said in a statement.As the geostationary satellite came to the end of its operational life, Dish had moved it to an altitude lower than the two parties had agreed on, where it ""could pose orbital debris concerns,"" the FCC said. The commission said Dish pledged in 2012 to elevate the satellite to 300 kilometers above its operational arc. But with fuel running low, it retired the satellite at an altitude just over 120 km above the original arc.""As satellite operations become more prevalent and the space economy accelerates, we must be certain that operators comply with their commitments,"" said the FCC enforcement bureau chief Loyaan A. Egal. ""This is a breakthrough settlement, making very clear the FCC has strong enforcement authority and capability to enforce its vitally important space debris rules.""The FCC said: ""The settlement includes an admission of liability from the company and an agreement to adhere to a compliance plan and pay a penalty of $150,000.""Dish did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The European Space Agency estimates that around 1 million pieces of debris larger than a centimeter – big enough to ""disable a spacecraft"" – are in Earth's orbit.They are already causing problems, from a near-miss in January last year involving a Chinese satellite, to a 5-millimeter hole knocked into a robotic arm on the International Space Station in 2021.

Nobel Prize for Physics honors tiny light pulses that capture changes in atoms,"    French-Swedish Anne L'Huillier, Frenchman Pierre Agostini and Austro-Hungarian Ferenc Krausz were honored for their work in observing electronic processes on the smallest possible time scale. ","It was the quickest Nobel Prize ever! On Tuesday October 3, the Swedish Academy celebrated the ""attosecond"" – a very, very short time – by awarding the Nobel Prize for Physics to French-Swedish Anne L'Huillier, Frenchman Pierre Agostini and Austro-Hungarian Ferenc Krausz. Attosecond? The blink of an eye might be fleeting, but it is still 1,000,000,000,000,000 times longer than a hundred attoseconds. In one attosecond, light travels three angstroms, the typical size of an atom.One attosecond is equal to exactly 10-18 seconds. It is 1,000 times shorter than another unit that was previously rewarded by the Nobel jury, in 1999, but in chemistry section: the femtosecond.This year's Nobel Prize in Physics does not celebrate a new word, of course, but the pioneers who brought it to life in the form of ultraviolet flashes of light lasting a few hundred attoseconds. It took more than 10 years of work and effort for the winners to reach this point.L'Huillier, 65, a professor at Lund University in Sweden, became the fifth French physicist to win this award, the 16th Nobel medal for France. And Agostini, born in 1941, former researcher at the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and now at Ohio State University, won the 17th. The French pair shared the prize equally with Krausz, 61, professor at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, near Munich (Germany).Missing from the list was Canadian Paul Corkum, soon to be 80, of the University of Ottawa, who was awarded the Wolf Prize in 2022, along with L'Huillier and Krausz. This prize is often considered to be a placeholder for the Nobel Prize. The three physicists' names were circulating so intensely that last year, the University of Ottawa anticipated the Nobel jury's announcement by prematurely posting a winning press release, which remained online for more than a few attoseconds.These scientists have each contributed to equipping chemists and physicists with ultra-fast cameras to film processes that are otherwise invisible because they are far too brief to be captured. Using lasers with pulses lasting just a few femtoseconds, chemists were able to see chemical bonds being broken for the first time. As in the stroboscopic effect, where scenes appear to freeze under the effect of the succession of flashes. Here, the scenes are not nightclub dancers, but equally stirring objects, on infinitely smaller scales: the electrons at the heart of molecules, which are responsible for chemical bonds.Attoseconds reveal an even more profound and agitated world. We see electrons tearing themselves away from a nucleus, jumping from one atom to another, taking on bizarre shapes in space, or moving from one internal energy state to another, like climbers on a ladder.",Science,quickest nobel prize ever tuesday october swedish academy celebrated attosecond short time awarding nobel prize physics french swedish anne lhuillier frenchman pierre agostini austro hungarian ferenc krausz attosecond blink eye might fleeting still times longer hundred attoseconds one attosecond light travels three angstroms size atom one attosecond equal exactly seconds times shorter another unit previously rewarded nobel jury chemistry section femtosecond years nobel prize physics celebrate new word course pioneers brought life form ultraviolet flashes light lasting hundred attoseconds took years work effort winners reach point lhuillier professor lund university sweden became fifth french physicist win award nobel medal france agostini born former researcher french atomic energy commission cea ohio state university french pair shared prize equally krausz professor max planck institute quantum optics near munich germany missing list canadian paul corkum soon university ottawa awarded wolf prize along lhuillier krausz prize often considered placeholder nobel prize three physicists names circulating intensely last year university ottawa anticipated nobel jurys announcement prematurely posting winning press release remained online attoseconds scientists contributed equipping chemists physicists ultra fast cameras film processes otherwise invisible far brief captured using lasers pulses lasting femtoseconds chemists able see chemical bonds broken first time strobosco scenes appear freeze effect succession flashes scenes nightclub dancers equally stirring objects infinitely smaller scales electrons heart molecules responsible chemical bonds attoseconds reveal even profound agitated world see electrons tearing away nucleus jumping one atom another taking bizarre shapes space moving one internal energy state another like climbers ladder,quickest nobel prize ever tuesday octob swedish academi celebr attosecond short time award nobel prize physic french swedish ann lhuillier frenchman pierr agostini austro hungarian ferenc krausz attosecond blink eye might fleet still time longer hundr attosecond one attosecond light travel three angstrom size atom one attosecond equal exactli second time shorter anoth unit previous reward nobel juri chemistri section femtosecond year nobel prize physic celebr new word cours pioneer brought life form ultraviolet flash light last hundr attosecond took year work effort winner reach point lhuillier professor lund univers sweden becam fifth french physicist win award nobel medal franc agostini born former research french atom energi commiss cea ohio state univers french pair share prize equal krausz professor max planck institut quantum optic near munich germani miss list canadian paul corkum soon univers ottawa award wolf prize along lhuillier krausz prize often consid placehold nobel prize three physicist name circul intens last year univers ottawa anticip nobel juri announc prematur post win press releas remain onlin attosecond scientist contribut equip chemist physicist ultra fast camera film process otherwis invis far brief captur use laser puls last femtosecond chemist abl see chemic bond broken first time strobosco scene appear freez effect success flash scene nightclub dancer equal stir object infinit smaller scale electron heart molecul respons chemic bond attosecond reveal even profound agit world see electron tear away nucleu jump one atom anoth take bizarr shape space move one intern energi state anoth like climber ladder
Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to three scientists for their work on tiny quantum dots,"    After the prize was unexpectedly leaked early on Wednesday morning, the chemistry prize was announced for US-based scientists Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov for their work on semiconductor nanocrystals known as quantum dots. ","Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday, October 4, for their work on tiny quantum dots. Moungi Bawendi, of MIT, Louis Brus, of Columbia University, and Alexei Ekimov, of Nanocrystals Technology Inc., were honored for their work with the tiny particles that are just a few atoms in diameter and whose electrons have constrained movement. This affects how they absorb and release visible light, allowing for very bright colors. They are used in many electronics, like LED displays.""These tiny particles have unique properties and now spread their light from television screens and LED lamps. They catalyze chemical reactions and their clear light can illuminate tumor tissue for a surgeon,"" according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which announced the award in Stockholm.In a highly unusual turn of events, Swedish media reported the names of the winners before the prize was announced. The academy did not comment on the leaked names before the announcement.The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the physics, chemistry and economics prizes, asks for nominations a year in advance from thousands of university professors and other scholars around the world.A committee for each prize then discusses candidates in a series of meetings throughout the year. At the end of the process, the committee presents one or more proposals to the full academy for a vote. The deliberations, including the names of nominees other than the winners, are kept confidential for 50 years.Last year, Americans Carolyn R. Bertozzi and K. Barry Sharpless, and Danish scientist Morten Meldal were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for developing a way of "" snapping molecules together"" that can be used to explore cells, map DNA and design drugs that can target diseases such as cancer more precisely.The Nobel Foundation raised the prize money by 10% this year to 11 million kronor (about $1 million).

Nobel Prize in Chemistry announcement disrupted by a leak,"    Four hours before the official announcement on Wednesday, a press release from the Royal Academy of Sciences revealing the winners was sent out in error. ","The Nobel Prize is a well-oiled machine. Everything is programmed down to the last detail, starting with the email sent to journalists at the beginning of September inviting them to the official announcement. The prize distribution schedule is also meticulously structured, with one award bestowed each day during the first week of October, starting with medicine, followed by physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and concluding with economics, all leading up to the ceremony on December 10.But on the morning of Wednesday, October 4, a glitch derailed everything. While the live presentation of the winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was scheduled for 11:45 am from the Royal Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, Swedish newsrooms began to panic a little after 7:30 am. Several journalists had just received a press release announcing that the prize had been awarded to Moungi Bawendi (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Louis Brus (Columbia University) and Alexei Ekimov (Nanocrystals Technology Inc.), ""for the development and synthesis of quantum dots.""While taking the precaution of using the conditional tense, the kingdom's media published the names of the winners a few moments later. For there was no room for doubt – the press release had indeed come from the Royal Academy of Sciences, a fact confirmed by several of its members, while assuring them that the official decision would only be taken in the morning, at a meeting of the committee responsible for awarding the prize.For a little over four hours, the situation was unclear, before geneticist Hans Ellengren, the Academy's permanent secretary, confirmed at 11:45 am that Bawendi, Brus and Ekimov were indeed this year's winners. Speaking live on the phone, Bawendi saved the committee's honor, assuring them that he was completely unaware of the mix-up and that he was fast asleep in his bed when the committee woke him to tell him the news.Damage was accordingly limited. At the press conference, however, Ellengren apologized for this departure from tradition, saying he was ""deeply sorry,"" without being able to explain, however, what might have happened. A ""very active"" investigation to determine the origin of the blunder is underway, he affirmed, assuring once again that the winners had been officially designated in the morning, but without saying whether other candidates were in the running.

Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded for quantum dots breakthrough,"    Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov were recognized for their contributions to the development of the nanocrystals used in television screens, optoelectronics and biological imaging. ","On Wednesday, October 4, the Nobel Committee confirmed that it had awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Moungi Bawendi (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Louis Brus (Columbia University) and Alexei Ekimov (Nanocrystals Technology Inc.) for the development of quantum dots. The names of the winners were leaked to the Swedish press following a ""blunder"" on the part of the committee, which had mistakenly sent a press release to certain Swedish media outlets earlier that morning.Discovered in the early 1980s, quantum dots have since been used in many industrial sectors. On television screens, they facilitate the full range adjustment of diode blue light, typically enhancing color richness. They are also used in optoelectronics (thermal cameras) as infrared light detectors in particular, at a lower cost than microelectronics techniques. In biology, they can be attached to proteins or markers, aiding in pinpointing their presence in small, highly specific quantities. Some people also dream of using quantum dots as future processors for quantum computers. ""We've been waiting a long time for this award. It highlights the founders of a field that is still very active,"" noted Thomas Pons, an Inserm physicist at ESPCI-Paris-PSL, who studies neuronal activity using these nanocrystals.Following this year's Nobel Prize in Physics, the chemistry prize also acknowledges the significance of electrons. This time, the laureates haven't tried to capture their lightning-fast movement around nuclei with attosecond precision. Instead, they've managed to harness and confine electrons within materials, enabling them to generate various colors on demand.What they have in common is the development of a very small component, just a few nanometers in size, or one billionth of a meter. It is 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair...This component, originally made of cadmium sulfate or selenide, but which can also contain gallium, indium, phosphorus or arsenic, is like a mini-crystal in which electrons are trapped. This confinement gives them their quantum character. While within the same massive material, they could move freely with any energy, within this context, their energy is ""quantized"". It cannot take on any value. It's like pushing a boulder up a slope: you can't just push it, you have to push it up a series of steps. Electrons are no longer free but can jump from one level of a ladder to another.The tighter the confinement, i.e., the smaller the crystal, the further apart the levels of the ladder become and the more violet the light emitted will be after a laser has exited the box. Varying the dimensions therefore changes the colors emitted. It's exactly as if the electrons were enclosed in an artificial atom, even though the object itself is made up of several hundred atoms.",Science,wednesday october nobel committee confirmed awarded nobel prize chemistry moungi bawendi massachusetts institute technology louis brus columbia university alexei ekimov nanocrystals technology inc development quantum dots names winners leaked swedish press following blunder part committee mistakenly sent press release certain swedish media outlets earlier morning discovered early quantum dots since used many industrial sectors television screens facilitate full range adjustment diode blue light enhancing color richness also used optoelectronics thermal cameras infrared light detectors particular lower cost microelectronics techniques biology attached proteins markers aiding pinpointing presence small highly specific quantities people also dream using quantum dots future processors quantum computers weve waiting long time award highlights founders field still active noted thomas pons inserm physicist espci paris psl studies neuronal activity using nanocrystals following years nobel prize physics chemistry prize also acknowledges significance electrons time laureates havent tried capture lightning fast movement around nuclei attosecond precision instead theyve managed harness confine electrons within materials enabling generate various colors demand common development small component nanometers size one billionth meter times smaller diameter human hair component originally made cadmium sulfate selenide also contain gallium indium phosphorus arsenic like mini crystal electrons trapped confinement gives quantum character within massive material could move freely energy within context energy quantized take value like pushing boulder slope cant push push series steps electrons longer free jump one level ladder another tighter confinement smaller crystal apart levels ladder become violet light emitted laser exited box varying dimensions therefore changes colors emitted exactly electrons enclosed artificial atom even though object made several hundred atoms,wednesday octob nobel committe confirm award nobel prize chemistri moungi bawendi massachusett institut technolog loui bru columbia univers alexei ekimov nanocryst technolog inc develop quantum dot name winner leak swedish press follow blunder part committe mistakenli sent press releas certain swedish media outlet earlier morn discov earli quantum dot sinc use mani industri sector televis screen facilit full rang adjust diod blue light enhanc color rich also use optoelectron thermal camera infrar light detector particular lower cost microelectron techniqu biolog attach protein marker aid pinpoint presenc small highli specif quantiti peopl also dream use quantum dot futur processor quantum comput weve wait long time award highlight founder field still activ note thoma pon inserm physicist espci pari psl studi neuron activ use nanocryst follow year nobel prize physic chemistri prize also acknowledg signific electron time laureat havent tri captur lightn fast movement around nuclei attosecond precis instead theyv manag har confin electron within materi enabl gener variou color demand common develop small compon nanomet size one billionth meter time smaller diamet human hair compon origin made cadmium sulfat selenid also contain gallium indium phosphoru arsen like mini crystal electron trap confin give quantum charact within massiv materi could move freeli energi within context energi quantiz take valu like push boulder slope cant push push seri step electron longer free jump one level ladder anoth tighter confin smaller crystal apart level ladder becom violet light emit laser exit box vari dimens therefor chang color emit exactli electron enclos artifici atom even though object made sever hundr atom
"Researchers find 23,000-year-old footprints in the United States","    New analyses confirm the age of footprints discovered in 2021, which prove the presence of humans in America during the last glacial maximum. ","Around 23,000 years ago, in present-day New Mexico, a group of hunters and gatherers roamed the shores of a lake surrounded by conifers and sagebrush, leaving their footprints in the mud alongside tracks of mammoths, wolves and giant sloths. These bare footprints, described in 2021 in the journal Science, are now preserved in the rock in the white gypsum desert of White Sands National Park. In a new study published on Friday, October 6, in the same journal, Matthew Bennett (University of Bournemouth, United Kingdom) and his colleagues confirm their age, using two new dating techniques.Since this discovery was announced, its age has been the subject of intense debate. These footprints challenge one of the dogmas of New World archaeology, which posits that humans did not inhabit the Americas before 13,500 years ago, the time when the ""Clovis"" culture is documented, characterized by distinctive lanceolate stone points. According to this theory, Paleo-Indians arrived in America from Asia via the Bering Strait, a route considered impassable during the last glacial maximum (approximately 26,500 to 19,000 years ago).The footprints at White Sands contradict this prevailing view. The initial dating, based on the analysis of radiocarbon in seeds of an aquatic plant called spiral rush, found mixed with the footprints, faced criticism. Radiocarbon dating can be influenced by the absorption of inorganic carbon dissolved in the water by these plants. This carbon may have an older origin, thus affecting the measurement. Recognizing this potential source of error, Bennett and his team also collected fossilized pollen samples, which are not susceptible to this ""reservoir effect."" They extracted approximately 75,000 pollen grains from each of the three samples, yielding radiocarbon dates ranging from 23,400 to 22,600 years, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2,500 years.For added reliability, they relied on a third dating method called ""optically stimulated luminescence."" This technique is based on the principle that minerals like quartz, when shielded from sunlight, accumulate charge based on the radiation they receive from their surroundings. This charge is reset when these crystals are exposed to light or heat. The time elapsed since their burial can be estimated by measuring the luminescence signal they emit when stimulated with monochromatic light. The quartz at White Sands provided a date of 21,500 years (plus or minus 2,000 years) using this method.",Science,around years ago present day new mexico group hunters gatherers roamed shores lake surrounded conifers sagebrush leaving footprints mud alongside tracks mammoths wolves giant sloths bare footprints described journal science preserved rock white gypsum desert white sands national park new study published friday october journal matthew bennett university bournemouth united kingdom colleagues confirm age using two new dating techniques since discovery announced age subject intense debate footprints challenge one dogmas new world archaeology posits humans inhabit americas years ago time clovis culture documented characterized distinctive lanceolate stone points according theory paleo indians arrived america asia via bering strait route considered impassable last glacial maximum approximately years ago footprints white sands contradict prevailing view initial dating based analysis radiocarbon seeds aquatic plant called spiral rush found mixed footprints faced criticism radiocarbon dating influenced absorption inorganic carbon dissolved water plants carbon may older origin thus affecting measurement recognizing potential source error bennett team also collected fossilized pollen samples susceptible reservoir effect extracted approximately pollen grains three samples yielding radiocarbon dates ranging years margin error plus minus years added reliability relied third dating method called optically stimulated luminescence technique based principle minerals like quartz shielded sunlight accumulate charge based radiation receive surroundings charge reset crystals exposed light heat time elapsed since burial estimated measuring luminescence signal emit stimulated monochromatic light quartz white sands provided date years plus minus years using method,around year ago present day new mexico group hunter gather roam shore lake surround conif sagebrush leav footprint mud alongsid track mammoth wolv giant sloth bare footprint describ journal scienc preserv rock white gypsum desert white sand nation park new studi publish friday octob journal matthew bennett univers bournemouth unit kingdom colleagu confirm age use two new date techniqu sinc discoveri announc age subject intens debat footprint challeng one dogma new world archaeolog posit human inhabit america year ago time clovi cultur document character distinct lanceol stone point accord theori paleo indian arriv america asia via bere strait rout consid impass last glacial maximum approxim year ago footprint white sand contradict prevail view initi date base analysi radiocarbon seed aquat plant call spiral rush found mix footprint face critic radiocarbon date influenc absorpt inorgan carbon dissolv water plant carbon may older origin thu affect measur recogn potenti sourc error bennett team also collect fossil pollen sampl suscept reservoir effect extract approxim pollen grain three sampl yield radiocarbon date rang year margin error plu minu year ad reliabl reli third date method call optic stimul luminesc techniqu base principl miner like quartz shield sunlight accumul charg base radiat receiv surround charg reset crystal expos light heat time elaps sinc burial estim measur luminesc signal emit stimul monochromat light quartz white sand provid date year plu minu year use method
French biotech company posts promising results for cancer vaccines,"    Transgene, whose vaccines use 'viral vector' technology to trigger an immune response, has reported encouraging results from early trials with head and neck cancer patients. ","When his oncologist at the Institut Curie, the French foundation for cancer research, in Paris suggested he take part in the clinical trial of a therapeutic vaccine designed to prevent a recurrence of his tongue cancer, Hervé F didn't have to be asked twice. ""Between a high risk of relapse and the thought that through this vaccine I might have a few more years ahead of me, I didn't hesitate.""The 65-year-old had perviously undergone traditional treatment for his cancer, which was diagnosed in mid-2021 – surgery to remove the tumor, which also led to the removal of a large part of his tongue, followed by radiotherapy sessions. ""An extremely painful treatment that ended in January 2022."" When we spoke to him by phone he had some difficulty in articulating himself, but Hervé said he was speaking and eating better and better, thanks to rehabilitation.The date July 25, 2022 remains engraved on his memory. On that day, Hervé F received his first injection. Then came a further 20, one a week for the first six weeks, then every fortnight. ""If this vaccine can delay or prevent the return of the cancer, it's a tremendous hope,"" he said, adding that he was doing well, had regained weight and had not experienced any side effects.Named TG4050, the vaccine targets ENT cancers, also known as ""head and neck cancers"" (mouth, pharynx, larynx). Caused by tobacco, alcohol and, in some cases, certain types of papillomavirus, these cancers come with a high risk of recurrence – 50%. The vaccine has been developed by French biotech company Transgene, based in Illkirch-Graffenstaden, just outside Strasbourg in northeastern France, a subsidiary of Institut Mérieux and listed on the stock exchange.The international trial began in January 2021 in Toulouse, led for France by Jean-Pierre Delord, oncologist and director of the Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse (IUCT)-Oncopole, and Christophe Le Tourneau, director of the early clinical trials department at the Institut Curie.

"In Sweden, a night of horror to explore the link between fear and pleasure","    In collaboration with Danish researchers, the Liseberg amusement park provided volunteers with an opportunity to confront their greatest fears in an experiment that took place on the night of October 11. ","""Face your worst nightmares. All alone. One night somewhere in Sweden."" Sweden's Liseberg amusement park in Gothenburg issued the challenge on September 13. To underscore the seriousness of this proposition, a short video clip was posted online, featuring images inspired by horror movie classics, such as bloodied hands, demonic laughter and a blade slicing through a piece of meat.By the September 25 deadline, 1,500 volunteers of all ages and from all over the world had applied. To take part, volunteers had to be over 18, love thrills and be available to travel to Sweden on Wednesday, October 11, when the Peak Fear Experiment would be held in collaboration with the Recreational Fear Lab, a research institute on recreational fear at the University of Aarhus, Denmark.Details of the event were kept secret, and for good reason: ""Not knowing what will happen is also part of the experience,"" said Marten Westlund, communications director at Liseberg. In tests carried out on people waiting in line for a haunted house in Denmark, Danish researchers noticed that visitors' hearts were already racing. ""People seem to systematically overestimate how scary an experience is going to be. And when they find out that it wasn't that bad, they get some relief and pleasure out of it,"" said Mathias Clasen, co-director of the laboratory.However, Westlund revealed that ""fewer than five volunteers"" would be subjected to their worst fears for one night. Among these fears, four regularly crop up: the fear of not knowing what's going to happen, the fear of heights, the fear of being alone and the fear of clowns. The volunteers would be equipped with various measuring devices, enabling scientists to gather data.To maintain safety, each candidate chose a safeword that they could say if they wanted to stop the experiment, and a doctor oversaw the experiment. The goal is to find out the optimal point between pleasure and terror. In a study published in November 2020 in the journal Psychological Science, the Aarhus researchers, who have dubbed it the fear ""sweet spot,"" demonstrated that ""enjoyment has an inverted-U-shaped relationship with fear,"" explained Clasen. To be entertaining, the fright must not be too intense, at the risk of becoming unpleasant.This was just one of many studies the Danish scientists have carried out since their first collaboration with an amusement park in 2016. Three years ago, it led to the creation of the laboratory.",Science,face worst nightmares alone one night somewhere sweden swedens liseberg amusement park gothenburg issued challenge september underscore seriousness proposition short video clip posted online featuring images inspired horror movie classics bloodied hands demonic laughter blade slicing piece meat september deadline volunteers ages world applied take part volunteers love thrills available travel sweden wednesday october peak fear experiment would held collaboration recreational fear lab research institute recreational fear university aarhus denmark details event kept secret good reason knowing happen also part experience said marten westlund communications director liseberg tests carried people waiting line haunted house denmark danish researchers noticed visitors hearts already racing people seem systematically overestimate scary experience going find wasnt bad get relief pleasure said mathias clasen director laboratory however westlund revealed fewer five volunteers would subjected worst fears one night among fears four regularly crop fear knowing whats going happen fear heights fear alone fear clowns volunteers would equipped various measuring devices enabling scientists gather data maintain safety candidate chose safeword could say wanted stop experiment doctor oversaw experiment goal find optimal point pleasure terror study published november journal psychological science aarhus researchers dubbed fear sweet spot demonstrated enjoyment inverted shaped relationship fear explained clasen entertaining fright must intense risk becoming unpleasant one many studies danish scientists carried since first collaboration amusement park three years ago led creation laboratory,face worst nightmar alon one night somewher sweden sweden liseberg amus park gothenburg issu challeng septemb underscor serious proposit short video clip post onlin featur imag inspir horror movi classic bloodi hand demon laughter blade slice piec meat septemb deadlin volunt age world appli take part volunt love thrill avail travel sweden wednesday octob peak fear experi would held collabor recreat fear lab research institut recreat fear univers aarhu denmark detail event kept secret good reason know happen also part experi said marten westlund commun director liseberg test carri peopl wait line haunt hous denmark danish research notic visitor heart alreadi race peopl seem systemat overestim scari experi go find wasnt bad get relief pleasur said mathia clasen director laboratori howev westlund reveal fewer five volunt would subject worst fear one night among fear four regularli crop fear know what go happen fear height fear alon fear clown volunt would equip variou measur devic enabl scientist gather data maintain safeti candid chose safeword could say want stop experi doctor oversaw experi goal find optim point pleasur terror studi publish novemb journal psycholog scienc aarhu research dub fear sweet spot demonstr enjoy invert shape relationship fear explain clasen entertain fright must intens risk becom unpleas one mani studi danish scientist carri sinc first collabor amus park three year ago led creation laboratori
Thomas Pesquet: 'I'd make a better living if I had stayed a pilot with Air France',"    In an autobiography, France's most famous astronaut tells all about his life above the Earth. Now addicted to space, he dreams of a third space mission. Objective: the Moon. ","The first thing that strikes you when you see Thomas Pesquet is his athletic physique, with pectoral muscles that could pop the buttons on his impeccably ironed white shirt. We were all familiar with his ""ideal son-in-law"" looks, ocean-blue eyes and good-natured smile, but we hadn't realized that a large part of the astronaut's job was to maintain a competition-winning figure at all costs. Weak eyes? A cavity? Hearing problems? You're out of the program. This is no laughing matter in the world of astronauts. We suspected as much, but on reading his autobiographical book, Ma Vie Sans Gravité (""My Life Without Gravity,"" to be published on October 18), there is – contrary to what the title suggests – little room for light-heartedness in the race to the stars.When we met him at La Closerie des Lilas – a legendary restaurant in the Montparnasse area of Paris – Pesquet ordered a Perrier with a slice of lemon. Normally, the self-described ""geographical bachelor"" – his partner, Anne, lives and works in Rome for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, while he works in Germany – allows himself to enjoy a drink with colleagues after work. But this morning, he only had time to run eight kilometers, so alcohol was out of the question. He politely asked the waiter for a table away from prying eyes. Not that he minds signing autographs, but it now happens often enough that he knows it could take all evening. He had come from Cologne, where he still works for the European Space Agency (ESA). Because Pesquet, 45, is not content with being the first Frenchman to have already been selected for two missions (Soyuz and SpaceX), totaling 396 days, 11 hours and 34 minutes in orbit: he's training hard to secure a third. A madman.When you read and hear about it from him, frankly, space adventure doesn't sound very appealing. Between his selection in 2009 and his 2016 lift-off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome (Kazakhstan), the young Pesquet, an aeronautical engineer turned Air France pilot, worked like hell, all with no guarantee of ever being chosen to climb aboard the rocket. Frankly, if we were in his shoes, we'd have given up a long time ago.Taking off is awful – especially for those who stay on the ground, family and friends, the astronaut readily admitted. ""When you say goodbye to them, you don't know if you're going to see them again."" The statistics are sobering: 5% chance of not making it back. From below, the image is, to say the least, anxiety-inducing: a giant stick of dynamite on fire. Inside, 54 hours of clenching your teeth in 3.5 square meters, a diaper in the spacesuit that makes you look like one of the Teletubbies, an 80-centimeter-diameter ""corridor"" to get out of the capsule – if you're claustrophobic, don't bother. Once inside the International Space Station, things don't get much better, comfort-wise. Insomniacs will get no help here: you have to sleep with your pillow attached to your head, without a blanket – because of the absence of gravity – and put up with 16 sunsets and sunrises every 24 hours. Hygiene-wise, we won't bore you with the details: wash with a towelette, underpants every other day, two pairs of socks a week, and don't miss the toilet (10 centimeters in diameter).",Science,first thing strikes see thomas pesquet athletic physique pectoral muscles could pop buttons impeccably ironed white shirt familiar ideal son law looks ocean blue eyes good natured smile hadnt realized large part astronauts job maintain competition winning figure costs weak eyes cavity hearing problems youre program laughing matter world astronauts suspected much reading autobiographical book vie sans gravit life without gravity published october contrary title suggests little room light heartedness race stars met closerie des lilas legendary restaurant montparnasse area paris pesquet ordered perrier slice lemon normally self described geographical bachelor partner anne lives works rome united nations food agriculture organization works germany allows enjoy drink colleagues work morning time run eight kilometers alcohol question politely asked waiter table away prying eyes minds signing autographs happens often enough knows could take evening come cologne still works european space agency esa pesquet content first frenchman already selected two missions soyuz spacex totaling days hours minutes orbit hes training hard secure third madman read hear frankly space adventure doesnt sound appealing selection lift baikonur cosmodrome kazakhstan young pesquet aeronautical engineer turned air france pilot worked like hell guarantee ever chosen climb aboard rocket frankly shoes wed given long time ago taking awful especially stay ground family friends astronaut readily admitted say goodbye dont know youre going see statistics sobering chance making back image say least anxiety inducing giant stick dynamite fire inside hours clenching teeth square meters diaper spacesuit makes look like one teletubbies centimeter diameter corridor get capsule youre claustrophobic dont bother inside international space station things dont get much better comfort wise insomniacs get help sleep pillow attached head without blanket absence gravity put sunsets sunrises every hours hygiene wise wont bore details wash towelette underpants every day two pairs socks week dont miss toilet centimeters diameter,first thing strike see thoma pesquet athlet physiqu pector muscl could pop button impecc iron white shirt familiar ideal son law look ocean blue eye good natur smile hadnt realiz larg part astronaut job maintain competit win figur cost weak eye caviti hear problem your program laugh matter world astronaut suspect much read autobiograph book vie san gravit life without graviti publish octob contrari titl suggest littl room light hearted race star met closeri de lila legendari restaur montparnass area pari pesquet order perrier slice lemon normal self describ geograph bachelor partner ann live work rome unit nation food agricultur organ work germani allow enjoy drink colleagu work morn time run eight kilomet alcohol question polit ask waiter tabl away pri eye mind sign autograph happen often enough know could take even come cologn still work european space agenc esa pesquet content first frenchman alreadi select two mission soyuz spacex total day hour minut orbit he train hard secur third madman read hear frankli space adventur doesnt sound appeal select lift baikonur cosmodrom kazakhstan young pesquet aeronaut engin turn air franc pilot work like hell guarante ever chosen climb aboard rocket frankli shoe wed given long time ago take aw especi stay ground famili friend astronaut readili admit say goodby dont know your go see statist sober chanc make back imag say least anxieti induc giant stick dynamit fire insid hour clench teeth squar meter diaper spacesuit make look like one teletubbi centimet diamet corridor get capsul your claustrophob dont bother insid intern space station thing dont get much better comfort wise insomniac get help sleep pillow attach head without blanket absenc graviti put sunset sunris everi hour hygien wise wont bore detail wash towelett underp everi day two pair sock week dont miss toilet centimet diamet
"An archaeological dig near Paris unearthed beginnings of urbanization dating back to 4,200 BC",    Archaeologists recently finished exploring the remains of a village in Ivry-sur-Seine surrounded by a vast wooden enclosure from the so-called 'Cerny' culture. ,"Tirelessly and methodically, a small group of archaeologists from the Institut National de Recherches Archéologiques Préventives (INRAP) and the Val-de-Marne department's archaeology service worked to rescue the settlement of our distant Middle Neolithic ancestors, 6,000 years ago, from oblivion and into the light. Time was of the essence. The day was September 27, and they had only two days before they would have to pack up and hand over the site to Ivry Confluences, one of the largest urban development projects in Paris' inner suburbs (145 hectares), near the junction of the Seine and the Marne rivers on the territory of Ivry-sur-Seine (Paris region), which has been underway for over ten years. These archaeological excavations are being carried out on the orders of the French state.What makes this latest campaign exceptional is the richness, density and quality of its finds. In recent years, 11 campaigns have been organized on several plots of land, three of them on the former site of the BHV department stores' warehouses, closed in 2012: In 2014, 2017, and this year from April to September.According to INRAP archaeologist Fabrice Marti in charge of the dig, 2023 is shaping up to be a vintage year. ""We came across portions of Middle Megalithic 1 walls, more specifically from the Cerny culture. A diagnosis usually enables us to more or less know what to expect, but this has been a very big surprise. We're inside a village. It's a first for this period. There's no equivalent."" The Cerny, named after a town in Essonne (south of Paris), spread across much of northern France and especially the Paris basin from the second half of the fifth millennium BC. It was characterized by the construction of walls, the rearing of cattle, and the production of ceramics with round pots adorned with geometric motifs hallmarked in bands. It also marked the beginning of megalithism in France.The first Ivry residents settled here around 4,200 BC. They built a wall, the full length of which has not been found, but it is estimated that several thousand large trees (around 30 centimeters in diameter) had to be felled to erect it. Because the site was a wet meadow, the trees had to be brought in from another location – a monumental task.Around 5,500 artifacts have been discovered, including shards of Cerny ceramics, flint, arrowheads, broken stone axes and two small pieces of jewelry made from elongated shells from the Atlantic Ocean... On the flip side, very few skeletal remains have been found. They were probably used to make glue or various objects, such as needles. This would imply that the meat they ate mainly came from livestock, with the overwhelming majority being beef and the remainder divided between mutton, goat and pork. As for game, which very much provided a minority of their meat supplies, it consisted of deer and wild boar.",Science,tirelessly methodically small group archaeologists institut national recherches arch ologiques ventives inrap val marne departments archaeology service worked rescue settlement distant middle neolithic ancestors years ago oblivion light time essence day september two days would pack hand site ivry confluences one largest urban development projects paris inner suburbs hectares near junction seine marne rivers territory ivry sur seine paris region underway ten years archaeological excavations carried orders french state makes latest campaign exceptional richness density quality finds recent years campaigns organized several plots land three former site bhv department stores warehouses closed year april september according inrap archaeologist fabrice marti charge dig shaping vintage year came across portions middle megalithic walls specifically cerny culture diagnosis usually enables less know expect big surprise inside village first period theres equivalent cerny named town essonne south paris spread across much northern france especially paris basin second half fifth millennium characterized construction walls rearing cattle production ceramics round pots adorned geometric motifs hallmarked bands also marked beginning megalithism france first ivry residents settled around built wall full length found estimated several thousand large trees around centimeters diameter felled erect site wet meadow trees brought another location monumental task around artifacts discovered including shards cerny ceramics flint arrowheads broken stone axes two small pieces jewelry made elongated shells atlantic ocean flip side skeletal remains found probably used make glue various objects needles would imply meat ate mainly came livestock overwhelming majority beef remainder divided mutton goat pork game much provided minority meat supplies consisted deer wild boar,tirelessli method small group archaeologist institut nation recherch arch ologiqu ventiv inrap val marn depart archaeolog servic work rescu settlement distant middl neolith ancestor year ago oblivion light time essenc day septemb two day would pack hand site ivri confluenc one largest urban develop project pari inner suburb hectar near junction sein marn river territori ivri sur sein pari region underway ten year archaeolog excav carri order french state make latest campaign except rich densiti qualiti find recent year campaign organ sever plot land three former site bhv depart store warehous close year april septemb accord inrap archaeologist fabric marti charg dig shape vintag year came across portion middl megalith wall specif cerni cultur diagnosi usual enabl less know expect big surpris insid villag first period there equival cerni name town essonn south pari spread across much northern franc especi pari basin second half fifth millennium character construct wall rear cattl product ceram round pot adorn geometr motif hallmark band also mark begin megalith franc first ivri resid settl around built wall full length found estim sever thousand larg tree around centimet diamet fell erect site wet meadow tree brought anoth locat monument task around artifact discov includ shard cerni ceram flint arrowhead broken stone axe two small piec jewelri made elong shell atlant ocean flip side skelet remain found probabl use make glue variou object needl would impli meat ate mainli came livestock overwhelm major beef remaind divid mutton goat pork game much provid minor meat suppli consist deer wild boar
'Ring of fire' eclipse brings cheers and shouts of joy  across the Americas,News,"First came the darkening skies, then the crescent-shaped shadows on the ground, and finally an eruption of cheers by crowds that gathered Saturday, October 14, along the narrow path of a rare ""ring of fire"" eclipse of the sun. It was a spectacular show for millions of people across the Americas as the moon moved into place and blocked out all but a brilliant circle of the sun's outer edge.Hundreds of people filed into the planetarium in the Caribbean resort city of Cancún to watch the eclipse. Some peered through box projectors, while others looked through telescopes and special glasses. Excited children whistled, as some adults raised their arms toward the sky as if to welcome the eclipse.Vendors selling plants outside observed the dance between the moon and the sun in a more natural way – with the help of trees as the shifting sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting unique shadows on the sidewalk.""There was silence and like a mist, as if it was dusk, but only a few minutes later the birds were singing again,"" said Carmen Jardines, 56, one of the vendors.Artemia Carreto, was telling passersby about her experience as a child in southern Mexico, when they were told to look instead at the river where it reflected beautifully on the sand beneath the water.While she wasn't near a river this time, Carreto said she was carried away by the sensations induced by changing temperatures and a feeling of heaviness that she pegged to the rotation of the Earth.Ancient Maya astronomers who tracked the movements of the sun and moon with precision referred to eclipses as ""broken sun."" They may have used dark volcanic glass to protect their eyes, said archeologist Arturo Montero of Tepeyac University in Mexico City.Unlike a total solar eclipse , the moon doesn't completely cover the sun during a ring of fire eclipse. When the moon lines up between Earth and the sun, it leaves a bright, blazing border.The entire eclipse – from the moment the moon starts to obscure the sun until it's back to normal – lasted 2 1/2 to three hours at any given spot. The ring of fire portion was from three to five minutes, depending on the location.Saturday's US path: Oregon, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Texas in the US, with a sliver of California, Arizona and Colorado. Then: Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Brazil. Much of the rest of the Western Hemisphere got a partial eclipse. NASA and other groups livestreamed the event.In Mexico, hundreds of people filed into the planetarium in the Caribbean resort city of Cancun to watch the eclipse. Some people peered through box projectors, while others looked through telescopes and special glasses.Excited children whistled, as some adults raised their arms towards the sky as if to welcome the eclipse. ""It is the third one that I have seen, but I come because of the energy it gives you. It is something that nature brings us and that we must watch,"" said Pilar Cáceres, 77, a retired elementary school teacher who watched the eclipse through a piece of cardboard that reflected the shadow on the ground.Cáceres wondered how the Maya civilization would observe the celestial event, because they were fearful of the phenomenon despite being great astronomers. ""We were told that some Maya people thought that eclipses were a curse because they burned their eyes and made them blind,"" she said.The Maya – who called eclipses ""broken sun"" – may have used dark volcanic glass to protect their eyes, said archeologist Arturo Montero of Tepeyac University in Mexico City.In the US, some eclipse watchers traveled to remote corners of the country to try to get the best view possible while those in Albuquerque got a double treat as the eclipse coincided with an international balloon fiesta that typically draws tens of thousands of spectators and hundreds of hot air balloon pilots from around the world.There were hoots, hollers and yelps from the balloon launch field as the moon began to cover the sun. Some pilots used their propane burners to shoot flames upward in unison as the spectacle unfolded. ""It's very exciting to be here and have the convergence of our love of flying with something very natural like an eclipse,"" said Allan Hahn, a balloon pilot from Aurora, Colorado.At Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah, enthusiasts hit the trails before sunrise to stake out their preferred spots among the red rock hoodoos. With the ring of fire in full form, cheers echoed through the canyons of the park. ""I just think it's one of those things that unites us all,"" said John Edwards, a cancer drug developer who traveled alone across the country to watch the eclipse from Bryce Canyon.Kirby James and Caroline McGuire from Toronto didn't realize they would be in a prime spot when they planned their trip to southern Utah. ""Nothing that you can read could prepare you for how it feels,"" said Kirby James, 63, a co-founder of a software company. ""It's the moment, especially when the ring of fire came on, you realized you were having a lifetime experience.""For the small towns and cities along the path, there was a mix of excitement, worries about the weather and concerns they'd be overwhelmed by visitors flocking to see the annular solar eclipse.In Eugene, Oregon, oohs and ahs combined with groans of disappointment as the eclipse was intermittently visible, the sun's light poking through the cloud cover only at times.Koren Marsh and her parents drove five hours from Seattle to be within the path of the eclipse. Making the trip to see the ring of fire was part of the celebrations for her 16th birthday, and she still appreciated getting glimpses between the clouds. ""It was worth it to me because I like science,"" she said.Viewers on the East Coast saw much less of the event, if anything. Much of the northeastern part of the region was socked in by clouds and rain.In southern Colombia, the Tatacoa desert played host to astronomers helping a group of visually impaired people experience the perfect golden ring created by the moon and sun through raised maps and temperature changes.Colombia Science Minister Yesenia Olaya said moments like this should inspire people to promote science among children, so they see it as ""a life project."" Juan Pablo Esguerra, 13, waited months to make the trip to the desert with his father to witness the eclipse. ""I like the astronomy because it's a spectacular experience,"" he said. ""This is the best that I've seen in my life.""In Mexico City, some children came dressed as astronauts as thousands of people gathered at the main esplanade of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the country's main public college. People shared special glasses, and the university set up telescopes.Saturday's eclipse marked the first for Brazil since 1994. The country's national observatory broadcast the event online while thousands flocked to parks and beaches in the north and northeastern regions to soak in the phenomenon.In April 2024, a total solar eclipse will crisscross the US in the opposite direction. That one will begin in Mexico and go from Texas to New England before ending in eastern Canada. The next ring of fire eclipse is in October 2024 at the southernmost tip of South America. Antarctica gets one in 2026. It will be 2039 before another ring of fire is visible in the US, and Alaska will be the only state in its direct path.",Science,first came darkening skies crescent shaped shadows ground finally

"Tree stumps reveal exceptional 14,300-year-old solar storm","    By analyzing the carbon-14 contained in prehistoric Scots pine trees, a French-British team has been able to trace a major solar eruption. ","Trees keep a chronicle of the past which researchers can read in two ways. The first, known as ""dendrochronology,"" involves counting and studying tree rings, the rings of wood that form each year at the periphery of the trunk. In Paris's Natural History Museum, it is possible to view the cross-section of a giant sequoia some 2,000 years old, with labels going back to the birth of Christ.The second way of tracing the past through wood is based on the carbon-14 present in each ring. By combining the two methods on the remains of very old trees, a French-British team has just made an astonishing discovery. In an article published on October 9 in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, the team revealed that there was an exceptional solar storm 14,300 years ago, undetected until now.To understand the link between tree remains thousands of years old and solar ejections 150 million kilometers away, it is important to delve into carbon-14. This radioactive carbon isotope is virtually stable in the atmosphere. Its gradual decay (which explains why it can't be used to date archaeological objects that are more than 55,000 years old) is constantly offset by the formation of new atoms, thanks to the cosmic rays that constantly reach the Earth. At the end of a cascade of reactions, a neutron takes the place of a proton in the nucleus of nitrogen atoms, transmuting them into carbon-14 atoms.So much for the everyday life of 14C, as atomic physicists write the isotope. Occasionally, however, the Sun gets in on the act. During one of its eruptions (or coronal mass ejections) large amounts of electrically charged particles are propelled into space. On reaching the Earth, they form a carbon-14 surplus in the atmosphere. If the amount of matter ejected is colossal, this extra 14C is detected in wood. This phenomenon was revealed in 2012 by Japanese researcher Fusa Miyake, who, when studying Japanese cedars, discovered a carbon-14 peak for the year 774, attributed to a solar event.The Scots pines involved in the latest discovery are much older trees, called ""subfossil trees."" Edouard Bard, Professor at the Collège de France and lead author of the study published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A explained: ""We call them 'subfossils' because, without being rock, they have begun a small transformation."" For the study, the European Centre for Research and Teaching in Environmental Geosciences, where Bard works, drew on the wood samples that the Mediterranean Institute of Biodiversity and Marine and Continental Ecology has been collecting for a quarter of a century, in the southern Alps between Grenoble and Sisteron. Buried in the thick alluvial deposits of the Drouzet, a local river, 172 subfossil trees have been recovered and studied.",Science,trees keep chronicle past researchers read two ways first known dendrochronology involves counting studying tree rings rings wood form year periphery trunk pariss natural history museum possible view cross section giant sequoia years old labels going back birth christ second way tracing past wood based carbon present ring combining two methods remains old trees french british team made astonishing discovery article published october journal philosophical transactions royal society team revealed exceptional solar storm years ago undetected understand link tree remains thousands years old solar ejections million kilometers away important delve carbon radioactive carbon isotope virtually stable atmosphere gradual decay explains cant used date archaeological objects years old constantly offset formation new atoms thanks cosmic rays constantly reach earth end cascade reactions neutron takes place proton nucleus nitrogen atoms transmuting carbon atoms much everyday life atomic physicists write isotope occasionally however sun gets act one eruptions coronal mass ejections large amounts electrically charged particles propelled space reaching earth form carbon surplus atmosphere amount matter ejected colossal extra detected wood phenomenon revealed japanese researcher fusa miyake studying japanese cedars discovered carbon peak year attributed solar event scots pines involved latest discovery much older trees called subfossil trees edouard bard professor coll france lead author study published philosophical transactions royal society explained call subfossils without rock begun small transformation study european centre research teaching environmental geosciences bard works drew wood samples mediterranean institute biodiversity marine continental ecology collecting quarter century southern alps grenoble sisteron buried thick alluvial deposits drouzet local river subfossil trees recovered studied,tree keep chronicl past research read two way first known dendrochronolog involv count studi tree ring ring wood form year peripheri trunk pariss natur histori museum possibl view cross section giant sequoia year old label go back birth christ second way trace past wood base carbon present ring combin two method remain old tree french british team made astonish discoveri articl publish octob journal philosoph transact royal societi team reveal except solar storm year ago undetect understand link tree remain thousand year old solar eject million kilomet away import delv carbon radioact carbon isotop virtual stabl atmospher gradual decay explain cant use date archaeolog object year old constantli offset format new atom thank cosmic ray constantli reach earth end cascad reaction neutron take place proton nucleu nitrogen atom transmut carbon atom much everyday life atom physicist write isotop occasion howev sun get act one erupt coron mass eject larg amount electr charg particl propel space reach earth form carbon surplu atmospher amount matter eject coloss extra detect wood phenomenon reveal japanes research fusa miyak studi japanes cedar discov carbon peak year attribut solar event scot pine involv latest discoveri much older tree call subfossil tree edouard bard professor coll franc lead author studi publish philosoph transact royal societi explain call subfossil without rock begun small transform studi european centr research teach environment geoscienc bard work drew wood sampl mediterranean institut biodivers marin continent ecolog collect quarter centuri southern alp grenobl sisteron buri thick alluvi deposit drouzet local river subfossil tree recov studi
'The European space industry needs to get its act together before it's too late',    The space summit that will be held in Seville in early November is a crucial opportunity to revamp the industry's organization from top to bottom and set ambitious and inspiring targets. ,"The European space industry is at a pivotal point in its history. The sector is going through a launch vehicle crisis, marked by the successive postponement of the Ariane 6 while the Vega-C rocket is still grounded. These setbacks have been coupled with deep-seated disagreements between European countries over its strategy. The European Space Summit that will be held in Seville, Spain, on November 6 and 7 is a crucial event for the continent's technological future.Europe must seize this opportunity to revamp the industry's organization from top to bottom and set ambitious and inspiring targets. Otherwise, Europe runs the risk of ending up on the wrong side of the telescope, condemning themselves to being spectators in a space race that has only just begun.The delay of the European launchers and the technical problems are only the tip of the iceberg. Behind these temporary misfires lies a deeper problem illustrated by the US competition, SpaceX.From launcher sizes, reusability, and economies of scale, the factors that can be used to lower transport costs for customers are in SpaceX's, owned by Elon Musk, favor. Added to this is SpaceX's fearsome efficiency in terms of decision-making speed and ability to adapt to unforeseen events, made possible thanks to greater digitalization.Europe, on the other hand, is locked into the rule of the ""geographical return."" In practice, each country contributing to the European Space Agency's (ESA) budget ends up recovering the equivalent of its contribution as contracts awarded to its industry, even if the country is not the best performer in its field. This model's cumbersome and inefficient nature has become a burden in the new space age.""The problem for Europe is not just a question of financial resources: For every euro invested, SpaceX is ten times more efficient, and the only way to increase efficiency is to introduce competition,"" argued Cédric O, a former French secretary of state for digital affairs and the co-author of ""Revolution Space,"" a report written by 12 experts and presented to the ESA in March.Competition: The word was long considered taboo until Germany sought to free itself from a model deemed too costly and that it suspected primarily served France's interests. Historically, France's nuclear deterrence has relied on technology launcher technology. German patience finally reached its limits a year ago, when Arianespace's then-boss promised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in person that the first Ariane 6 launch would take place in 2023, even though this was an impossible pledge. Since then, mistrust has reached new heights, such that Berlin has told Ariane, ""nein, danke.""",Science,european space industry pivotal point history sector going launch vehicle crisis marked successive postponement ariane vega rocket still grounded setbacks coupled deep seated disagreements european countries strategy european space summit held seville spain november crucial event continents technological future europe must seize opportunity revamp industrys organization top bottom set ambitious inspiring targets otherwise europe runs risk ending wrong side telescope condemning spectators space race begun delay european launchers technical problems tip iceberg behind temporary misfires lies deeper problem illustrated competition spacex launcher sizes reusability economies scale factors used lower transport costs customers spacexs owned elon musk favor added spacexs fearsome efficiency terms decision making speed ability adapt unforeseen events made possible thanks greater digitalization europe hand locked rule geographical return practice country contributing european space agencys esa budget ends recovering equivalent contribution contracts awarded industry even country best performer field models cumbersome inefficient nature become burden new space age problem europe question financial resources every euro invested spacex ten times efficient way increase efficiency introduce competition argued dric former french secretary state digital affairs author revolution space report written experts presented esa march competition word long considered taboo germany sought free model deemed costly suspected primarily served frances interests historically frances nuclear deterrence relied technology launcher technology german patience finally reached limits year ago arianespaces boss promised german chancellor olaf scholz person first ariane launch would take place even though impossible pledge since mistrust reached new heights berlin told ariane nein danke,european space industri pivot point histori sector go launch vehicl crisi mark success postpon arian vega rocket still ground setback coupl deep seat disagr european countri strategi european space summit held sevil spain novemb crucial event contin technolog futur europ must seiz opportun revamp industri organ top bottom set ambiti inspir target otherwis europ run risk end wrong side telescop condemn spectat space race begun delay european launcher technic problem tip iceberg behind temporari misfir lie deeper problem illustr competit spacex launcher size reusabl economi scale factor use lower transport cost custom spacex own elon musk favor ad spacex fearsom effici term decis make speed abil adapt unforeseen event made possibl thank greater digit europ hand lock rule geograph return practic countri contribut european space agenc esa budget end recov equival contribut contract award industri even countri best perform field model cumbersom ineffici natur becom burden new space age problem europ question financi resourc everi euro invest spacex ten time effici way increas effici introduc competit argu dric former french secretari state digit affair author revolut space report written expert present esa march competit word long consid taboo germani sought free model deem costli suspect primarili serv franc interest histor franc nuclear deterr reli technolog launcher technolog german patienc final reach limit year ago arianespac boss promis german chancellor olaf scholz person first arian launch would take place even though imposs pledg sinc mistrust reach new height berlin told arian nein dank
How gestation remodels brains of mice to promote maternal behaviors,    Two sex hormones target a small population of neurons in the rodent brain to prepare it for motherhood. ,"After every mammal birth, if everything goes well, a small miracle happens: maternal attachment. But to what extent are maternal behaviors linked to changes in the brains of mothers-to-be during pregnancy? In the October 6 issue of the journal Science, a British team from the Francis-Crick Institute in London provided part of the answer. In mice, two sex hormones remodel the mother's brain during gestation, promoting behaviors such as returning to the nest, grooming and breastfeeding.It was long thought that the sex hormones released during childbirth played a decisive role in the onset of maternal care. However, the British study showed that estradiol and progesterone are active in the brain of the mother-to-be even before she gives birth.Here's how: These two hormones target a small region of the hypothalamus, called the medial preoptic area, known for its important role in the control of mating and offspring care. To be more precise, these hormones act on a small population of neurons within this region, called the ""galanin neurons,"" which govern maternal behavior.In female mice that had never mated, the authors made these neurons insensitive to one or both of these hormones by selectively inactivating the hormone receptors carried by the cells. Then they let half of those females mate. As a result, those that had offspring showed a complete loss of feeding behavior.But the two hormones worked differently. Estradiol made the neurons more excitable, fortifying the mothers' receptiveness to their offspring's signals. This modification faded as the offspring grew.Progesterone, on the other hand, encouraged the formation of excitatory synapses on the galanin neurons. This rewiring persisted, reinforcing maternal behavior long after the offspring had been weaned. ""This observation would explain why females of many species behave maternally towards offspring that are not their own, once they have experienced motherhood,"" said Margaret McCarthy from the University of Maryland in Baltimore (USA).London team coordinator Johannes Kohl said, ""What's fascinating is to see that the brain prepares well before birth for this major life change."" Its rewiring leads to ""a shift in priorities"": While virgin mice focus on mating, mothers must ensure the survival of their young. Postdoctoral fellow Rachida Ammari, first author of the paper, added, ""To prepare for this future behavioral challenge, there is a window of plasticity in the brain.""According to the authors, women's brains also undergo a similar process during pregnancy. In mothers' brains, in fact, there is a before and after those nine months of accommodation and growth of the fetus in utero, as was revealed by a Dutch team in 2022. On the one hand, pregnancy seems to induce specific and lasting changes in the volume of cerebral gray matter. It reorganizes a small region involved in our ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes, which is the same region that is activated when mothers look at their babies. This reorganization seems to last at least two years after delivery. On the other hand, the brain's white matter is also remodeled. As in mice, this reconfiguration seems to be linked to estradiol, which is released during the third trimester of pregnancy. This could be one of the keys to a mother's attachment to her offspring and her receptiveness to the signals they send her, even if it's not the only determining factor. A special bond, of course, can also develop during the process of adoption.",Science,every mammal birth everything goes well small miracle happens maternal attachment extent maternal behaviors linked changes brains mothers pregnancy october issue journal science british team francis crick institute london provided part answer mice two sex hormones remodel mothers brain gestation promoting behaviors returning nest grooming breastfeeding long thought sex hormones released childbirth played decisive role onset maternal care however british study showed estradiol progesterone active brain mother even gives birth heres two hormones target small region hypothalamus called medial preoptic area known important role control mating offspring care precise hormones act small population neurons within region called galanin neurons govern maternal behavior female mice never mated authors made neurons insensitive one hormones selectively inactivating hormone receptors carried cells let half females mate result offspring showed complete loss feeding behavior two hormones worked differently estradiol made neurons excitable fortifying mothers receptiveness offsprings signals modification faded offspring grew progesterone hand encouraged formation excitatory synapses galanin neurons rewiring persisted reinforcing maternal behavior long offspring weaned observation would explain females many species behave maternally towards offspring experienced motherhood said margaret mccarthy university maryland baltimore usa london team coordinator johannes kohl said whats fascinating see brain prepares well birth major life change rewiring leads shift priorities virgin mice focus mating mothers must ensure survival young postdoctoral fellow rachida ammari first author paper added prepare future behavioral challenge window plasticity brain according authors womens brains also undergo similar process pregnancy mothers brains fact nine months accommodation growth fetus utero revealed dutch team one hand pregnancy seems induce specific lasting changes volume cerebral gray matter reorganizes small region involved ability put someone elses shoes region activated mothers look babies reorganization seems last least two years delivery hand brains white matter also remodeled mice reconfiguration seems linked estradiol released third trimester pregnancy could one keys mothers attachment offspring receptiveness signals send even determining factor special bond course also develop process adoption,everi mammal birth everyth goe well small miracl happen matern attach extent matern behavior link chang brain mother pregnanc octob issu journal scienc british team franci crick institut london provid part answer mice two sex hormon remodel mother brain gestat promot behavior return nest groom breastfeed long thought sex hormon releas childbirth play decis role onset matern care howev british studi show estradiol progesteron activ brain mother even give birth here two hormon target small region hypothalamu call medial preoptic area known import role control mate offspr care precis hormon act small popul neuron within region call galanin neuron govern matern behavior femal mice never mate author made neuron insensit one hormon select inactiv hormon receptor carri cell let half femal mate result offspr show complet loss feed behavior two hormon work differ estradiol made neuron excit fortifi mother recept offspr signal modif fade offspr grew progesteron hand encourag format excitatori synaps galanin neuron rewir persist reinforc matern behavior long offspr wean observ would explain femal mani speci behav matern toward offspr experienc motherhood said margaret mccarthi univers maryland baltimor usa london team coordin johann kohl said what fascin see brain prepar well birth major life chang rewir lead shift prioriti virgin mice focu mate mother must ensur surviv young postdoctor fellow rachida ammari first author paper ad prepar futur behavior challeng window plastic brain accord author women brain also undergo similar process pregnanc mother brain fact nine month accommod growth fetu utero reveal dutch team one hand pregnanc seem induc specif last chang volum cerebr gray matter reorgan small region involv abil put someon els shoe region activ mother look babi reorgan seem last least two year deliveri hand brain white matter also remodel mice reconfigur seem link estradiol releas third trimest pregnanc could one key mother attach offspr recept signal send even determin factor special bond cours also develop process adopt
Artificial Intelligence deciphers images perceived by the human brain,"    A Meta team has reproduced, in some cases with impressive precision, photographs viewed by volunteers based on AI analysis of their brain activity. ","Will artificial intelligence (AI) one day be able to read our brains and track our thoughts? A series of recent studies suggests that AI is capable of decoding and translating our cerebral activity, in the form of text and images, as we're listening to a story, wanting to talk, or looking at images. The latest of this work, presented in Paris on Wednesday, October 18, by a team from Meta AI (formerly Facebook), demonstrates these spectacular advances.Jean-Rémi King and his colleagues described how their AI algorithms were able to faithfully reproduce photographs viewed by volunteers, based on analysis of their brain activity. Their observations were presented in a preprint – a paper not yet peer-reviewed before publication in a scientific journal. They were based on data sets obtained by magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on volunteers who were shown photographs. This data was then submitted to a series of AI decoders, which learned to interpret and transcribe them back into images.The result? Although the likeness between the original and the copy is not perfect, the similarities are often striking. A zebra is clad in a cross between cowhide and okapi, a little girl with a kite has an unidentified object above her head, but a surfer seems to be riding the same wave as the model in the photo, and a skier in a red wetsuit retains the same posture as the original. The ""wow effect"" is guaranteed, ""even for the researchers on our team,"" admitted King, an academic researcher (CNRS, ENS) currently on a five-year assignment with Meta AI. ""Just two years ago, I would have never thought that this kind of result would be possible.""In recent months, several papers in the field of speech have demonstrated the potential of AI to decode brain activity, whether by invasive means – data collection via electrodes implanted in the brain of paralyzed people – or non-invasive ones, as with MEG, fMRI, large machines in which the subjects' heads are immersed, but also with a simple cap for electroencephalograms (EEG).On May 1 in the journal Nature Neuroscience, a team from the University of Austin (Texas), led by Alexander Huth, described an attempt to use an AI decoder to reproduce short stories heard by subjects placed in an fMRI scanner. The experiment was not entirely conclusive but showed that the AI could partially retrieve the words and general meaning. It was also able to produce a text from a story imagined by the volunteers, or from a video they watched. Part of the meaning was preserved, with greater fidelity than a purely random text. It's as if the brain, through these various modalities – by listening to, imagining or observing the narrative – produced ""a neural code shared between the visual and the spoken word,"" said King.",Science,artificial intelligence one day able read brains track thoughts series recent studies suggests capable decoding translating cerebral activity form text images listening story wanting talk looking images latest work presented paris wednesday october team meta formerly facebook demonstrates spectacular advances jean king colleagues described algorithms able faithfully reproduce photographs viewed volunteers based analysis brain activity observations presented preprint paper yet peer reviewed publication scientific journal based data sets obtained magnetoencephalography meg functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri volunteers shown photographs data submitted series decoders learned interpret transcribe back images result although likeness original copy perfect similarities often striking zebra clad cross cowhide okapi little girl kite unidentified object head surfer seems riding wave model photo skier red wetsuit retains posture original wow effect guaranteed even researchers team admitted king academic researcher cnrs ens currently five year assignment meta two years ago would never thought kind result would possible recent months several papers field speech demonstrated potential decode brain activity whether invasive means data collection via electrodes implanted brain paralyzed people non invasive ones meg fmri large machines subjects heads immersed also simple cap electroencephalograms eeg may journal nature neuroscience team university austin texas led alexander huth described attempt use decoder reproduce short stories heard subjects placed fmri scanner experiment entirely conclusive showed could partially retrieve words general meaning also able produce text story imagined volunteers video watched part meaning preserved greater fidelity purely random text brain various modalities listening imagining observing narrative produced neural code shared visual spoken word said king,artifici intellig one day abl read brain track thought seri recent studi suggest capabl decod translat cerebr activ form text imag listen stori want talk look imag latest work present pari wednesday octob team meta formerli facebook demonstr spectacular advanc jean king colleagu describ algorithm abl faith reproduc photograph view volunt base analysi brain activ observ present preprint paper yet peer review public scientif journal base data set obtain magnetoencephalographi meg function magnet reson imag fmri volunt shown photograph data submit seri decod learn interpret transcrib back imag result although like origin copi perfect similar often strike zebra clad cross cowhid okapi littl girl kite unidentifi object head surfer seem ride wave model photo skier red wetsuit retain postur origin wow effect guarante even research team admit king academ research cnr en current five year assign meta two year ago would never thought kind result would possibl recent month sever paper field speech demonstr potenti decod brain activ whether invas mean data collect via electrod implant brain paralyz peopl non invas one meg fmri larg machin subject head immers also simpl cap electroencephalogram eeg may journal natur neurosci team univers austin texa led alexand huth describ attempt use decod reproduc short stori heard subject place fmri scanner experi entir conclus show could partial retriev word gener mean also abl produc text stori imagin volunt video watch part mean preserv greater fidel pure random text brain variou modal listen imagin observ narr produc neural code share visual spoken word said king
China launches new mission to space station,    The world's second-largest economy has pumped billions of dollars into its military-run space program in an effort to catch up with the United States and Russia. ,"China sent a fresh crew to its Tiangong space station on Thursday, October 26, in the latest mission for a growing space program that plans to send people to the Moon by 2030.The Shenzhou-17 blasted off from the Jiuquan launch site in northwest China at 11:14 am (4:14 am Paris time), carrying a three-astronaut team with the youngest average age since the space station's construction.At a farewell ceremony, hundreds of supporters waving the Chinese national flag and clutching yellow flowers cheered on the three astronauts – wearing white and blue spacesuits – as they were introduced to the crowds. The patriotic song ""Ode to the Motherland"" was sung as the space travelers walked slowly down a short pathway between the crowds, smiling and waving goodbye before boarding a bus to the launch site.Captaining the crew is Tang Hongbo, who is on his first return mission to the space station. Accompanying him are Tang Shengjie and Jiang Xinlin, both in their thirties and each making maiden space voyages. The all-male crew is the youngest ever to man a mission to the space station, with an average age of 38.They are set to ""perform various in-orbit space science and application payload tests and experiments,"" Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday. They will also conduct some maintenance work on the station to fix some ""minor damages"" from space debris, he said. ""We have found that the solar wings of the space station had been hit by tiny space particles several times,"" Lin explained.Members of the previous Shenzhou-16 crew – aboard Tiangong for nearly five months now – are preparing to receive the trio before returning to Earth next week.Hundreds of spectators gathered on Thursday morning near the rocket site at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, in the Gobi Desert, some wearing the blue uniforms of China's space agency. Excitement broke out among the crowd as a loudspeaker blared a countdown and the rocket lifted off, sending plumes of smoke across the launch pad and the dry, flat desert expanse surrounding the site, before the increasingly loud roar of the engines drowned out the applause.A livestream showed the crew onboard the space station monitoring their ascent in anticipation of their arrival. After the rocket had been airborne for about 15 minutes, a space program official proclaimed the launch a ""complete success."" Tiangong, the crown jewel of Beijing's space programme, is constantly crewed by rotating teams of three astronauts.Plans for China's ""space dream"" have been put into overdrive under President Xi Jinping. The world's second-largest economy has pumped billions of dollars into its military-run space program in an effort to catch up with the United States and Russia.In June, the return capsule of the Shenzhou-15 spaceship touched down at a landing site in the northern Inner Mongolia region, with state media hailing the mission as a ""complete success.""That month also saw the launch of the Shenzhou-16 capsule, which carried the first Chinese civilian – Beihang University professor Gui Haichao – into orbit. That crew will return to Earth on October 31 after completing a handover, officials said Wednesday.Beijing also aims to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030 and plans to build a base on the lunar surface. Deputy director Lin reiterated that aim Wednesday, saying that the ""goal of landing Chinese people on the moon by 2030 will be realized as scheduled.""",Science,china sent fresh crew tiangong space station thursday october latest mission growing space program plans send people moon shenzhou blasted jiuquan launch site northwest china paris time carrying three astronaut team youngest average age since space stations construction farewell ceremony hundreds supporters waving chinese national flag clutching yellow flowers cheered three astronauts wearing white blue spacesuits introduced crowds patriotic song ode motherland sung space travelers walked slowly short pathway crowds smiling waving goodbye boarding bus launch site captaining crew tang hongbo first return mission space station accompanying tang shengjie jiang xinlin thirties making maiden space voyages male crew youngest ever man mission space station average age set perform various orbit space science application payload tests experiments lin xiqiang deputy director china manned space agency said wednesday also conduct maintenance work station fix minor damages space debris said found solar wings space station hit tiny space particles several times lin explained members previous shenzhou crew aboard tiangong nearly five months preparing receive trio returning earth next week hundreds spectators gathered thursday morning near rocket site jiuquan satellite launch centre gobi desert wearing blue uniforms chinas space agency excitement broke among crowd loudspeaker blared countdown rocket lifted sending plumes smoke across launch pad dry flat desert expanse surrounding site increasingly loud roar engines drowned applause livestream showed crew onboard space station monitoring ascent anticipation arrival rocket airborne minutes space program official proclaimed launch complete success tiangong crown jewel beijings space programme constantly crewed rotating teams three astronauts plans chinas space dream put overdrive president jinping worlds second largest economy pumped billions dollars military run space program effort catch united states russia june return capsule shenzhou spaceship touched landing site northern inner mongolia region state media hailing mission complete success month also saw launch shenzhou capsule carried first chinese civilian beihang university professor gui haichao orbit crew return earth october completing handover officials said wednesday beijing also aims send crewed mission moon plans build base lunar surface deputy director lin reiterated aim wednesday saying goal landing chinese people moon realized scheduled,china sent fresh crew tiangong space station thursday octob latest mission grow space program plan send peopl moon shenzhou blast jiuquan launch site northwest china pari time carri three astronaut team youngest averag age sinc space station construct farewel ceremoni hundr support wave chines nation flag clutch yellow flower cheer three astronaut wear white blue spacesuit introduc crowd patriot song ode motherland sung space travel walk slowli short pathway crowd smile wave goodby board bu launch site captain crew tang hongbo first return mission space station accompani tang shengji jiang xinlin thirti make maiden space voyag male crew youngest ever man mission space station averag age set perform variou orbit space scienc applic payload test experi lin xiqiang deputi director china man space agenc said wednesday also conduct mainten work station fix minor damag space debri said found solar wing space station hit tini space particl sever time lin explain member previou shenzhou crew aboard tiangong nearli five month prepar receiv trio return earth next week hundr spectat gather thursday morn near rocket site jiuquan satellit launch centr gobi desert wear blue uniform china space agenc excit broke among crowd loudspeak blare countdown rocket lift send plume smoke across launch pad dri flat desert expans surround site increasingli loud roar engin drown applaus livestream show crew onboard space station monitor ascent anticip arriv rocket airborn minut space program offici proclaim launch complet success tiangong crown jewel beij space programm constantli crew rotat team three astronaut plan china space dream put overdr presid jinp world second largest economi pump billion dollar militari run space program effort catch unit state russia june return capsul shenzhou spaceship touch land site northern inner mongolia region state media hail mission complet success month also saw launch shenzhou capsul carri first chines civilian beihang univers professor gui haichao orbit crew return earth octob complet handov offici said wednesday beij also aim send crew mission moon plan build base lunar surfac deputi director lin reiter aim wednesday say goal land chines peopl moon realiz schedul
Enigma of Mars' internal structure finally solved,    Two studies published Wednesday in the journal 'Nature' conclude that there is a 150-kilometer-thick layer of magma in the lower part of the mantle surrounding the Red Planet's core. ,"In December 2022, NASA announced the end of its InSight Mars mission. After more than four years on the surface of the Red Planet, the lander, on whose panels a thick layer of dust had settled, no longer had enough energy to work. Death by suffocation, as it were. However, in space exploration, long after the robots stop working, the data recorded continues to feed science, and InSight is no exception. The anomaly in the internal structure of Mars was resolved on Wednesday, October 25, in the journal Nature, which published two studies, independent of each other but based on measurements from the lander's main instrument, the SEIS seismometer supplied by France.Two years ago, in the summer of 2021, the InSight team described the internal structure of Mars for the first time. To achieve this, they deciphered the seismic waves created by ""Marsquakes"" and meteorite impacts. The speed at which these waves propagate depends on the properties (such as density, temperature and compressibility) of the medium they pass through. This reveals its chemical composition and whether it is solid, soft or liquid. The result obtained in 2021 shows three simple layers: a thin crust overlying a rocky, homogeneous and unstratified mantle, which itself surrounds a fairly large metallic and liquid core, with a radius of 1,830 kilometers (the Martian radius measures 3,390 kilometers).However, there was a snag, an anomaly summarized by Henri Samuel, a CNRS researcher working at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) and lead author of one of the two studies: ""The nucleus we had was not very dense. To achieve this low density, we had to add light elements to the iron, such as sulfur, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. The problem was that we had to add a lot, too much compared to what was allowed.""Of course, there's no instruction manual for a planetary core, but the laws of physics and chemistry do set constraints. ""Experiments have been carried out in the laboratory, under high temperature and pressure, attempting to incorporate light elements into iron alloys,"" said Samuel. ""The limits that these tests established were somewhat exceeded by data from the Mars core.""What's more, the quantities of light elements assumed to be present in the Mars core did not tally with the materials available at the time of planet formation, 4.5 billion years ago. Since the anomaly could not be solved, ""we learned to live with it,"" said Samuel with a smile.However, on September 18, 2021, an unexpected event shed new light on the matter. On that day, a meteorite crashed on Mars, some distance from InSight. This generated waves that were different from the previous ones and capable of propagating in liquid, where their speed was halved. As Samuel pointed out, ""the propagation time recorded for this event was far too slow to be explained by a homogeneous, solid mantle."" The 2021 model no longer held water: the mantle had to be heterogeneous and based on a liquid layer, which is stable because it is weighed down by iron, which had previously been confused with the upper part of the core.",Science,december nasa announced end insight mars mission four years surface red planet lander whose panels thick layer dust settled longer enough energy work death suffocation however space exploration long robots stop working data recorded continues feed science insight exception anomaly internal structure mars resolved wednesday october journal nature published two studies independent based measurements landers main instrument seis seismometer supplied france two years ago summer insight team described internal structure mars first time achieve deciphered seismic waves created marsquakes meteorite impacts speed waves propagate depends properties density temperature compressibility medium pass reveals chemical composition whether solid soft liquid result obtained shows three simple layers thin crust overlying rocky homogeneous unstratified mantle surrounds fairly large metallic liquid core radius kilometers martian radius measures kilometers however snag anomaly summarized henri samuel cnrs researcher working institut physique globe paris ipgp lead author one two studies nucleus dense achieve low density add light elements iron sulfur carbon oxygen hydrogen problem add lot much compared allowed course theres instruction manual planetary core laws physics chemistry set constraints experiments carried laboratory high temperature pressure attempting incorporate light elements iron alloys said samuel limits tests established somewhat exceeded data mars core whats quantities light elements assumed present mars core tally materials available time planet formation billion years ago since anomaly could solved learned live said samuel smile however september unexpected event shed new light matter day meteorite crashed mars distance insight generated waves different previous ones capable propagating liquid speed halved samuel pointed propagation time recorded event far slow explained homogeneous solid mantle model longer held water mantle heterogeneous based liquid layer stable weighed iron previously confused upper part core,decemb nasa announc end insight mar mission four year surfac red planet lander whose panel thick layer dust settl longer enough energi work death suffoc howev space explor long robot stop work data record continu feed scienc insight except anomali intern structur mar resolv wednesday octob journal natur publish two studi independ base measur lander main instrument sei seismomet suppli franc two year ago summer insight team describ intern structur mar first time achiev deciph seismic wave creat marsquak meteorit impact speed wave propag depend properti densiti temperatur compress medium pass reveal chemic composit whether solid soft liquid result obtain show three simpl layer thin crust overli rocki homogen unstratifi mantl surround fairli larg metal liquid core radiu kilomet martian radiu measur kilomet howev snag anomali summar henri samuel cnr research work institut physiqu globe pari ipgp lead author one two studi nucleu dens achiev low densiti add light element iron sulfur carbon oxygen hydrogen problem add lot much compar allow cours there instruct manual planetari core law physic chemistri set constraint experi carri laboratori high temperatur pressur attempt incorpor light element iron alloy said samuel limit test establish somewhat exceed data mar core what quantiti light element assum present mar core talli materi avail time planet format billion year ago sinc anomali could solv learn live said samuel smile howev septemb unexpect event shed new light matter day meteorit crash mar distanc insight gener wave differ previou one capabl propag liquid speed halv samuel point propag time record event far slow explain homogen solid mantl model longer held water mantl heterogen base liquid layer stabl weigh iron previous confus upper part core

","This discovery promises intense debate among primatologists, anthropologists and doctors alike. On Friday, October 27, American scientists announced, in the journal Science, that they had for the first time demonstrated the presence of menopausal females in a group of wild chimpanzees.The observation was made by Kevin Langergraber's team from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), using data collected over a period of 21 years on the Ngogo community, a group of over 200 chimpanzees based in Uganda's Kibale National Park. According to the researchers' calculations, females spend an average of 20% of their adult lives in a ""post-reproductive"" state.In the wild, almost no vertebrate lives beyond its reproductive period, with the exception of a few species of toothed whales (including orcas) and humans. The laws of evolution seem clear: what's the point of a species burdening itself with individuals unable to procreate? As for humans, there are two opposing theories. The cooperative theory, often summarized as the ""grandmother hypothesis,"" holds that post-menopausal females help their daughters with maternal care, thereby boosting their grandchildren's chances of survival, and therefore the transmission of their genes. The other, known as the competition theory, considers that menopause helps to avoid a struggle for resources to raise a calf within the same family, between mothers of two different generations – mother and daughter or mother-in-law and daughter-in-law – from which the older ones could come out on the losing side. In orcas, the key role played by matriarchs argues in favor of the cooperation theory.What about non-human primates? In zoos, several studies have found that females spend an average of 20% to 25% of their lives without reproducing. But captivity upsets all life parameters, especially longevity. So it's out of the question to draw any rules from such observations. Conversely, menopause has never been observed in any wild population.It's now a fact, said the UCLA researchers. They base their claim on 21 years of data collected between 1995 and 2016 at Ngogo, in the center of Kibale National Park, in southwestern Uganda. A considerable amount of work according to program coordinator Kevin Langergraber. ""This means 20 years in the forest, almost every day, to record births, deaths, emigrations and female immigrations between the different groups,"" he explained. They collected demographic data on 185 females.They show that these animals began to give birth from the age of 13 or 14, with a peak between 15 and 19, and that a clear decline in fertility was observed from the age of 30 onwards, with a total halt ""near age 50, as in humans,"" the article stressed.",Science,discovery promises intense debate among primatologists anthropologists doctors alike friday october american scientists announced journal science first time demonstrated presence menopausal females group wild chimpanzees observation made kevin langergrabers team university california los angeles ucla using data collected period years ngogo community group chimpanzees based ugandas kibale national park according researchers calculations females spend average adult lives post reproductive state wild almost vertebrate lives beyond reproductive period exception species toothed whales including orcas humans laws evolution seem clear whats point species burdening individuals unable procreate humans two opposing theories cooperative theory often summarized grandmother hypothesis holds post menopausal females help daughters maternal care thereby boosting grandchildrens chances survival therefore transmission genes known competition theory considers menopause helps avoid struggle resources raise calf within family mothers two different generations mother daughter mother law daughter law older ones could come losing side orcas key role played matriarchs argues favor cooperation theory non human primates zoos several studies found females spend average lives without reproducing captivity upsets life parameters especially longevity question draw rules observations conversely menopause never observed wild population fact said ucla researchers base claim years data collected ngogo center kibale national park southwestern uganda considerable amount work according program coordinator kevin langergraber means years forest almost every day record births deaths emigrations female immigrations different groups explained collected demographic data females show animals began give birth age peak clear decline fertility observed age onwards total halt near age humans article stressed,discoveri promis intens debat among primatologist anthropologist doctor alik friday octob american scientist announc journal scienc first time demonstr presenc menopaus femal group wild chimpanze observ made kevin langergrab team univers california lo angel ucla use data collect period year ngogo commun group chimpanze base uganda kibal nation park accord research calcul femal spend averag adult live post reproduct state wild almost vertebr live beyond reproduct period except speci tooth whale includ orca human law evolut seem clear what point speci burden individu unabl procreat human two oppos theori cooper theori often summar grandmoth hypothesi hold post menopaus femal help daughter matern care therebi boost grandchildren chanc surviv therefor transmiss gene known competit theori consid menopaus help avoid struggl resourc rais calf within famili mother two differ gener mother daughter mother law daughter law older one could come lose side orca key role play matriarch argu favor cooper theori non human primat zoo sever studi found femal spend averag live without reproduc captiv upset life paramet especi longev question draw rule observ convers menopaus never observ wild popul fact said ucla research base claim year data collect ngogo center kibal nation park southwestern uganda consider amount work accord program coordin kevin langergrab mean year forest almost everi day record birth death emigr femal immigr differ group explain collect demograph data femal show anim began give birth age peak clear declin fertil observ age onward total halt near age human articl stress
Scientific journal impacted by Israel-Hamas war,"    The editor-in-chief of 'eLife' magazine, Michael Eisen, was fired after a controversial tweet about the Israel-Hamas war, provoking a debate about freedom of speech. ","The shockwaves of the Israel-Hamas war continue to spread. Scientific journals, which might have thought themselves immune from the tremors, are now being hit. The editor-in-chief of the scientific journal eLife, Michael Eisen, was dismissed on October 24 following a controversial tweet on X (formerly Twitter). This decision on the part of the board of directors has provoked a heated debate within the publication but also more widely in the research community, where many voices were upset by this challenge to freedom of expression.It all began on October 13. Eisen, who is a professor of biology at the University of California, Berkeley, and has run the journal since 2019, retweeted an article, on his personal account,  from the satirical newspaper The Onion about the bombings in Gaza. Its headline sets the tone: ""Dying Gazans Criticized For Not Using Last Words To Condemn Hamas."" ""Bingo,"" Eisen commented. He then posted a second tweet: ""The Onion speaks with more courage, insight and moral clarity than the leaders of every academic institution put together. I wish there were a @TheOnion university.""The controversy quickly spread on the social media platform, an amplifier of all negative feelings. A number of Israeli scientists announced that they would no longer submit articles to the magazine as long as Eisen was editor-in-chief. This first led the board to distance itself from the offending tweet. Then, on October 24, it announced Eisen's ""replacement."" The stated reason: ""[H]is approach to leadership, communication and social media has at key times been detrimental to the cohesion of the community we are trying to build and hence to eLife's mission."" According to this statement, his tweet was just ""a further incidence of this behavior.""It's true that Eisen is not exactly a champion of consensus. A renowned molecular biologist, he has gained much of his celebrity for the fight he has waged over the past 25 years against the dominant model of scientific publishing, which elevates journals as the sole judges of the quality of scientific work and imposes exorbitant access fees on readers. With two other researchers, he first created the PLOS group, which offers readers free access to published content. This alternative model, which charges publication fees to the authors of the articles, has been a great success – but has also earned Eisen some strong enemies in the process.Things got even worse in 2019, when he transformed eLife. The journal now only publishes articles that have already been submitted to preprint servers. What's more, it makes all peer reviews public, unlike most journals. And, since January this year, all peer-reviewed articles are published, even if the reviews are negative. No more monopoly on publication, no more secret judgments, no more rejection by reviewers...",Science,shockwaves israel hamas war continue spread scientific journals might thought immune tremors hit editor chief scientific journal elife michael eisen dismissed october following controversial tweet formerly twitter decision part board directors provoked heated debate within publication also widely research community many voices upset challenge freedom expression began october eisen professor biology university california berkeley run journal since retweeted article personal account satirical newspaper onion bombings gaza headline sets tone dying gazans criticized using last words condemn hamas bingo eisen commented posted second tweet onion speaks courage insight moral clarity leaders every academic institution put together wish university controversy quickly spread social media platform amplifier negative feelings number israeli scientists announced would longer submit articles magazine long eisen editor chief first led board distance offending tweet october announced eisens replacement stated reason approach leadership communication social media key times detrimental cohesion community trying build hence elifes mission according statement tweet incidence behavior true eisen exactly champion consensus renowned molecular biologist gained much celebrity fight waged past years dominant model scientific publishing elevates journals sole judges quality scientific work imposes exorbitant access fees readers two researchers first created plos group offers readers free access published content alternative model charges publication fees authors articles great success also earned eisen strong enemies process things got even worse transformed elife journal publishes articles already submitted preprint servers whats makes peer reviews public unlike journals since january year peer reviewed articles published even reviews negative monopoly publication secret judgments rejection reviewers,shockwav israel hama war continu spread scientif journal might thought immun tremor hit editor chief scientif journal elif michael eisen dismiss octob follow controversi tweet formerli twitter decis part board director provok heat debat within public also wide research commun mani voic upset challeng freedom express began octob eisen professor biolog univers california berkeley run journal sinc retweet articl person account satir newspap onion bomb gaza headlin set tone die gazan critic use last word condemn hama bingo eisen comment post second tweet onion speak courag insight moral clariti leader everi academ institut put togeth wish univers controversi quickli spread social media platform amplifi neg feel number isra scientist announc would longer submit articl magazin long eisen editor chief first led board distanc offend tweet octob announc eisen replac state reason approach leadership commun social media key time detriment cohes commun tri build henc elif mission accord statement tweet incid behavior true eisen exactli champion consensu renown molecular biologist gain much celebr fight wage past year domin model scientif publish elev journal sole judg qualiti scientif work impos exorbit access fee reader two research first creat plo group offer reader free access publish content altern model charg public fee author articl great success also earn eisen strong enemi process thing got even wors transform elif journal publish articl alreadi submit preprint server what make peer review public unlik journal sinc januari year peer review articl publish even review neg monopoli public secret judgment reject review
Europe's space industry searches for a way out of its crisis,"    The 22 member states of the European Space Agency are meeting in Seville on Monday, in an attempt to find a compromise between the German and French positions and to secure the funding operation of Ariane-6. ","A bitter anniversary looms. On December 2, 2014, unsettled by the sudden emergence of Elon Musk, who was imposing himself on the launcher market by smashing prices, the Europeans reacted by deciding to design Ariane-6, a rocket capable of competing with the billionaire's Falcon 9s. The goal was to achieve a first flight in July 2020.Almost nine years later, this deadline has long passed unachieved. Worse still, Musk's SpaceX dominates the market and sets the rules. As of this autumn, Europe no longer has access to space. The last Ariane-5 was launched in July and the planned transition to its successor, Ariane-6, has not gone ahead as planned due to accumulated delays. The first launch is not expected before 2024. To make matters worse, the small Italian Vega rocket made its last launch in October, and the program for the next model, Vega-C, was suspended after an in-flight failure.In addition to the technical and industrial difficulties experienced by the Ariane-6 program and its cumbersome organization, political tensions have been mounting in recent years. Germany, one of the three main partners in the project led by the European Space Agency (ESA), alongside France, the program's prime contractor, and Italy, now wants to go it alone in space. It intends to put an end to ArianeGroup's French leadership in this field by pursuing its own development of mini-launch vehicles, which would compete with Ariane and Vega. To open the competition up, Berlin is exerting pressure by threatening to stop funding the European launcher, judged to be too expensive and poorly managed.It is against this tense backdrop that the representatives of ESA's 22 member countries will meet on Monday, November 6 in Seville (Spain). This looks set to be a crucial meeting for the first of the two days of the Space Summit, held every six months in the country currently holding the rotating presidency of Europe – currently Spain – and which will continue the following day, Tuesday, with a European Union Council meeting devoted to space issues.The aim is to find a compromise that guarantees the first 10 years of the Ariane-6 operation and to prepare for the future by opening up the launcher market to competition. If the discussions succeed, a new chapter in European space history will be written, marked by a paradigm shift similar to that experienced in the United States with the arrival of private competitors such as Musk.The controversial issue is the funding of Ariane-6. Over time, the program's cost overruns have been grudgingly acknowledged by all participants who subscribed to the first 15 launches. But nothing has been resolved for the next phase, the operational phase. Initially, ESA's plan was for Ariane-6 to become autonomous from the 16th launch, with no need for additional contributions from member states. This is not the case, as soaring raw material prices and general inflation have aggravated the situation.",Science,bitter anniversary looms december unsettled sudden emergence elon musk imposing launcher market smashing prices europeans reacted deciding design ariane rocket capable competing billionaires falcon goal achieve first flight july almost nine years later deadline long passed unachieved worse still musks spacex dominates market sets rules autumn europe longer access space last ariane launched july planned transition successor ariane gone ahead planned due accumulated delays first launch expected make matters worse small italian vega rocket made last launch october program next model vega suspended flight failure addition technical industrial difficulties experienced ariane program cumbersome organization political tensions mounting recent years germany one three main partners project led european space agency esa alongside france programs prime contractor italy wants alone space intends put end arianegroups french leadership field pursuing development mini launch vehicles would compete ariane vega open competition berlin exerting pressure threatening stop funding european launcher judged expensive poorly managed tense backdrop representatives esas member countries meet monday november seville spain looks set crucial meeting first two days space summit held every six months country currently holding rotating presidency europe currently spain continue following day tuesday european union council meeting devoted space issues aim find compromise guarantees first years ariane operation prepare future opening launcher market competition discussions succeed new chapter european space history written marked paradigm shift similar experienced united states arrival private competitors musk controversial issue funding ariane time programs cost overruns grudgingly acknowledged participants subscribed first launches nothing resolved next phase operational phase initially esas plan ariane become autonomous launch need additional contributions member states case soaring raw material prices general inflation aggravated situation,bitter anniversari loom decemb unsettl sudden emerg elon musk impos launcher market smash price european react decid design arian rocket capabl compet billionair falcon goal achiev first flight juli almost nine year later deadlin long pass unachiev wors still musk spacex domin market set rule autumn europ longer access space last arian launch juli plan transit successor arian gone ahead plan due accumul delay first launch expect make matter wors small italian vega rocket made last launch octob program next model vega suspend flight failur addit technic industri difficulti experienc arian program cumbersom organ polit tension mount recent year germani one three main partner project led european space agenc esa alongsid franc program prime contractor itali want alon space intend put end arianegroup french leadership field pursu develop mini launch vehicl would compet arian vega open competit berlin exert pressur threaten stop fund european launcher judg expens poorli manag tens backdrop repres esa member countri meet monday novemb sevil spain look set crucial meet first two day space summit held everi six month countri current hold rotat presid europ current spain continu follow day tuesday european union council meet devot space issu aim find compromis guarante first year arian oper prepar futur open launcher market competit discuss succeed new chapter european space histori written mark paradigm shift similar experienc unit state arriv privat competitor musk controversi issu fund arian time program cost overrun grudgingli acknowledg particip subscrib first launch noth resolv next phase oper phase initi esa plan arian becom autonom launch need addit contribut member state case soar raw materi price gener inflat aggrav situat
Europe's Euclid satellite reveals its first images of the cosmos,"    The satellite, whose mission will be to track down dark matter and dark energy, will enter its operational phase in January 2024. ","The Perseus cluster of galaxies, the famous Horsehead Nebula in the constellation Orion, the beautiful spiral galaxy IC 342, the irregular galaxy NGC 6822 and a globular cluster of stars located in the Milky Way 7,800 light-years from Earth: These are the subjects of the first five color photographs taken by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid satellite and unveiled on Tuesday, November 7. They were not five close-up portraits, but rather five landscapes. Euclid's main characteristic is to take wide-field images, unlike the Hubble or James Webb Space Telescopes, which focus their gaze on tiny portions of the sky.Launched on July 1 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the cosmology satellite, whose mission is to track down dark matter and dark energy – two mysterious entities that form 95% of the Universe – has still not entered its operational phase. It took a month to reach its final destination, the 2nd Lagrange point, a stable zone in space 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, on the opposite side of the Sun. This is where the James Webb Space Telescope is also located. The next step was to check that the device and its instruments were working properly, with all its challenges.The ESA was disappointed to discover that, at times, Euclid's fine guidance system, disturbed by protons from the Sun, was losing its guide stars, which had the effect of destabilizing the device and producing images where the stars appeared to be looping. To put things right, a corrective patch had to be written and uploaded to the satellite.Another area of concern for researchers was the phenomenon of ice deposition. As Francis Bernardeau, an astrophysicist at the French research laboratory CEA and deputy head of the Euclid scientific consortium, which brings together more than 250 laboratories worldwide, explained, ""the water contained in the satellite's materials evaporates and re-condenses on the instruments. This is a problem encountered by every space imager, which is very difficult to assess and model. But in this case, with Euclid, we're better off than we thought.""The researchers and engineers who remotely monitor the satellite are now in the process of evaluating its performance. This is crucial, as Euclid is aiming for extremely high image quality in order to study the distribution of dark matter and draw up the largest three-dimensional map of the Universe. The gamble appears to have paid off, according to Bernardeau: ""As far as image sharpness is concerned, we're well up to expectations. The trick will be to maintain this quality over the six years of the mission."" Nevertheless, the images revealed on November 7 reveal the presence of strange bluish spots. ""These are ghost images due to the inevitable imperfections of the optical system,"" explained the CEA researcher. ""But once everything is calibrated, we'll be able to clean them up.""",Science,perseus cluster galaxies famous horsehead nebula constellation orion beautiful spiral galaxy irregular galaxy ngc globular cluster stars located milky way light years earth subjects first five color photographs taken european space agencys esa euclid satellite unveiled tuesday november five close portraits rather five landscapes euclids main characteristic take wide field images unlike hubble james webb space telescopes focus gaze tiny portions sky launched july cape canaveral florida cosmology satellite whose mission track dark matter dark energy two mysterious entities form universe still entered operational phase took month reach final destination lagrange point stable zone space million kilometers earth opposite side sun james webb space telescope also located next step check device instruments working properly challenges esa disappointed discover times euclids fine guidance system disturbed protons sun losing guide stars effect destabilizing device producing images stars appeared looping put things right corrective patch written uploaded satellite another area concern researchers phenomenon ice deposition francis bernardeau astrophysicist french research laboratory cea deputy head euclid scientific consortium brings together laboratories worldwide explained water contained satellites materials evaporates condenses instruments problem encountered every space imager difficult assess model case euclid better thought researchers engineers remotely monitor satellite process evaluating performance crucial euclid aiming extremely high image quality order study distribution dark matter draw largest three dimensional map universe gamble appears paid according bernardeau far image sharpness concerned well expectations trick maintain quality six years mission nevertheless images revealed november reveal presence strange bluish spots ghost images due inevitable imperfections optical system explained cea researcher everything calibrated well able clean,perseu cluster galaxi famou horsehead nebula constel orion beauti spiral galaxi irregular galaxi ngc globular cluster star locat milki way light year earth subject first five color photograph taken european space agenc esa euclid satellit unveil tuesday novemb five close portrait rather five landscap euclid main characterist take wide field imag unlik hubbl jame webb space telescop focu gaze tini portion sky launch juli cape canaver florida cosmolog satellit whose mission track dark matter dark energi two mysteri entiti form univers still enter oper phase took month reach final destin lagrang point stabl zone space million kilomet earth opposit side sun jame webb space telescop also locat next step check devic instrument work properli challeng esa disappoint discov time euclid fine guidanc system disturb proton sun lose guid star effect destabil devic produc imag star appear loop put thing right correct patch written upload satellit anoth area concern research phenomenon ice deposit franci bernardeau astrophysicist french research laboratori cea deputi head euclid scientif consortium bring togeth laboratori worldwid explain water contain satellit materi evapor condens instrument problem encount everi space imag difficult assess model case euclid better thought research engin remot monitor satellit process evalu perform crucial euclid aim extrem high imag qualiti order studi distribut dark matter draw largest three dimension map univers gambl appear paid accord bernardeau far imag sharp concern well expect trick maintain qualiti six year mission nevertheless imag reveal novemb reveal presenc strang bluish spot ghost imag due inevit imperfect optic system explain cea research everyth calibr well abl clean
The crucial paradigm shift undertaken by Europe's space agency,The ESA opened up its market to greater competition at a time when control of space has become a question of sovereignty in an increasingly conflict-ridden world.,"Once again, the principle that Europe only makes progress during crises is proving true. At a time when the European space sector is going through one of the most difficult periods in its history, the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA) took a salutary leap forward in an attempt to get out of the rut at the Seville summit on November 6 and 7. By radically modifying its organization and opening up its market to greater competition, Europe's space industry is undergoing an essential paradigm shift. But this shift is only one step toward ensuring that the European Union fully masters its destiny in this field.At a time when the international space race was in full swing, the situation called for an urgent response, without which Europe was destined for irredeemable relegation. Deprived of a launcher for months due to the repeated delays of Ariane-6 and the temporary failure of Italy's Vega-C rocket, outclassed by Elon Musk's SpaceX, ESA was at an impasse. In just eight years, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets have carried out as many launches as Ariane-5 did in 27 years, and the performance gap between the two models continues to widen.The agreement reached in Seville was a compromise set against a backdrop of French-German rivalries. The French side could be satisfied with having secured financing for Ariane-6 operations for the next few years, in exchange for cost-cutting efforts. In return, the Germans have opened up the launcher market to competition. This is a major shift, but not unprecedented: NASA underwent a similar restructuring 15 years ago, culminating in the success of SpaceX.This choice marks a smooth transition from the ""geographical return"" rule, which had become entangled with bureaucracy and costs at a time when the ecosystem is undergoing profound change with the emergence of the new space industry. Until now, each country contributing to the ESA budget could recover an amount equivalent to its contribution in the form of contracts awarded to its industry, even if it was not the best performer in its field. The organization of a competition is intended to make the European space industry more responsive and efficient.At the same time, ESA has also been given the go-ahead to launch a tender for a cargo spacecraft capable of shuttling goods between Earth and low-Earth orbit. It will be up to companies in the sector to define their own project and raise funds from private investors within the framework set by the European agency. In the absence of its own resources, the ESA was condemned to stagnation in the field of space exploration. The tendering solution opens up new prospects, including the possibility of manned flight in the longer term.Although belated, this move away from a pattern that has run out of steam comes at a time when control of space has become a question of sovereignty in an increasingly conflict-ridden world, in which technological competition is exacerbated. In the long term, this context will also call for a change in decision-making within Europe's space industry. The EU cannot simply remain one of ESA's clients (which include Switzerland, the UK and Norway). It must be able to take its space destiny into its own hands, to ensure its sovereignty. This ambition necessarily requires a change in governance, which has yet to be achieved.",Science,principle europe makes progress crises proving true time european space sector going one difficult periods history member states european space agency esa took salutary leap forward attempt get rut seville summit november radically modifying organization opening market greater competition europes space industry undergoing essential paradigm shift shift one step toward ensuring european union fully masters destiny field time international space race full swing situation called urgent response without europe destined irredeemable relegation deprived launcher months due repeated delays ariane temporary failure italys vega rocket outclassed elon musks spacex esa impasse eight years spacexs falcon rockets carried many launches ariane years performance gap two models continues widen agreement reached seville compromise set backdrop french german rivalries french side could satisfied secured financing ariane operations next years exchange cost cutting efforts return germans opened launcher market competition major shift unprecedented nasa underwent similar restructuring years ago culminating success spacex choice marks smooth transition geographical return rule become entangled bureaucracy costs time ecosystem undergoing profound change emergence new space industry country contributing esa budget could recover amount equivalent contribution form contracts awarded industry even best performer field organization competition intended make european space industry responsive efficient time esa also given ahead launch tender cargo spacecraft capable shuttling goods earth low earth orbit companies sector define project raise funds private investors within framework set european agency absence resources esa condemned stagnation field space exploration tendering solution opens new prospects including possibility manned flight longer term although belated move away pattern run steam comes time control space become question sovereignty increasingly conflict ridden world technological competition exacerbated long term context also call change decision making within europes space industry simply remain one esas clients include switzerland norway must able take space destiny hands ensure sovereignty ambition necessarily requires change governance yet achieved,principl europ make progress crise prove true time european space sector go one difficult period histori member state european space agenc esa took salutari leap forward attempt get rut sevil summit novemb radic modifi organ open market greater competit europ space industri undergo essenti paradigm shift shift one step toward ensur european union fulli master destini field time intern space race full swing situat call urgent respons without europ destin irredeem releg depriv launcher month due repeat delay arian temporari failur itali vega rocket outclass elon musk spacex esa impass eight year spacex falcon rocket carri mani launch arian year perform gap two model continu widen agreement reach sevil compromis set backdrop french german rivalri french side could satisfi secur financ arian oper next year exchang cost cut effort return german open launcher market competit major shift unpreced nasa underw similar restructur year ago culmin success spacex choic mark smooth transit geograph return rule becom entangl bureaucraci cost time ecosystem undergo profound chang emerg new space industri countri contribut esa budget could recov amount equival contribut form contract award industri even best perform field organ competit intend make european space industri respons effici time esa also given ahead launch tender cargo spacecraft capabl shuttl good earth low earth orbit compani sector defin project rais fund privat investor within framework set european agenc absenc resourc esa condemn stagnat field space explor tender solut open new prospect includ possibl man flight longer term although belat move away pattern run steam come time control space becom question sovereignti increasingli conflict ridden world technolog competit exacerb long term context also call chang decis make within europ space industri simpli remain one esa client includ switzerland norway must abl take space destini hand ensur sovereignti ambit necessarili requir chang govern yet achiev
Crisis over for Europe’s Ariane-6 rocket,"    After two years of tension between France and Germany, a financial agreement guaranteeing the operation of the future launcher was reached on Monday, at a meeting of the 22 member states of the European Space Agency. ","The purpose of this audit was to get Ariane-6 out of the crisis. At the meeting in Seville on Monday, November 6, the 22 member states of the European Space Agency (ESA) reached an agreement to ensure the operation of the future launcher. The agreement was subject to conditions, as the first step is to limit public funding to a maximum of €340 million per year for three years from 2026.France, the principal sponsor for the ESA program, will contribute 55.3%, followed by Germany (21%) and Italy (7.6%), with the remainder divided between the 10 other countries participating in the project. To achieve this, the manufacturers involved – mainly France’s ArianeGroup, Germany’s MT Aerospace and Italy’s Avio – were asked to reduce their costs by 11%. An audit was underway to achieve this. The aim was even to reduce public funding to below €300 million over the years.This financial commitment guaranteed 27 Ariane-6 launches between 2026 and 2028. What’s more, France, Germany and Italy decided to go beyond these three years, adding a further 18 months and committing to a further 15 launches, for a total of 42 launches between now and 2030. ""This guarantees the solidity of the Ariane-6 business model for the next decade,"" said the Paris-based company.Reaching an agreement was a prerequisite for France to make progress on other issues, in the face of Germany, which for two years had been contesting the management of the project and calling for the launcher market to be opened up to competition. France was all the more insistent in view of the fact that, after the €4 billion invested in Ariane-6 for its development, the operating phase after the 16th launch in 2026 was initially scheduled to be self-financing. This has not happened, however, due to the sharp rise in raw material prices and the return of inflation since the war in Ukraine.""The priority is to get Ariane-6 to its maiden flight as quickly as possible, and to get Vega-C back on track,"" insisted ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher, the imperative for Europe being to regain autonomous access to space as quickly as possible, something it has lost in recent months. Both Ariane-6 (launched four years late) and the small Italian rocket Vega-C will have to wait until 2024.In return for continued support for Ariane-6, an agreement was reached to open up the European launcher market to competition, in a space market destabilized over the last ten years by the arrival of Elon Musk with Space X.",Science,purpose audit get ariane crisis meeting seville monday november member states european space agency esa reached agreement ensure operation future launcher agreement subject conditions first step limit public funding maximum million per year three years france principal sponsor esa program contribute followed germany italy remainder divided countries participating project achieve manufacturers involved mainly france arianegroup germany aerospace italy avio asked reduce costs audit underway achieve aim even reduce public funding million years financial commitment guaranteed ariane launches france germany italy decided beyond three years adding months committing launches total launches guarantees solidity ariane business model next decade said paris based company reaching agreement prerequisite france make progress issues face germany two years contesting management project calling launcher market opened competition france insistent view fact billion invested ariane development operating phase launch initially scheduled self financing happened however due sharp rise raw material prices return inflation since war ukraine priority get ariane maiden flight quickly possible get vega back track insisted esa director general josef aschbacher imperative europe regain autonomous access space quickly possible something lost recent months ariane launched four years late small italian rocket vega wait return continued support ariane agreement reached open european launcher market competition space market destabilized last ten years arrival elon musk space,purpos audit get arian crisi meet sevil monday novemb member state european space agenc esa reach agreement ensur oper futur launcher agreement subject condit first step limit public fund maximum million per year three year franc princip sponsor esa program contribut follow germani itali remaind divid countri particip project achiev manufactur involv mainli franc arianegroup germani aerospac itali avio ask reduc cost audit underway achiev aim even reduc public fund million year financi commit guarante arian launch franc germani itali decid beyond three year ad month commit launch total launch guarante solid arian busi model next decad said pari base compani reach agreement prerequisit franc make progress issu face germani two year contest manag project call launcher market open competit franc insist view fact billion invest arian develop oper phase launch initi schedul self financ happen howev due sharp rise raw materi price return inflat sinc war ukrain prioriti get arian maiden flight quickli possibl get vega back track insist esa director gener josef aschbach imper europ regain autonom access space quickli possibl someth lost recent month arian launch four year late small italian rocket vega wait return continu support arian agreement reach open european launcher market competit space market destabil last ten year arriv elon musk space
"Scientists make heads, instead of tails, of starfish anatomy","    An international study has unraveled the age-old mystery: that the echinoderm has no tail or trunk, just a head. ","It sounds like a children's game or an absurd question: Where is the starfish's head? In reality, the enigma has been occupying specialists for over a century, given the unusual structure of the animal and all its cousins in the echinoderm group (sea urchins, sea cucumbers and so forth). While all species from the Deuterostomia super-branch are axially symmetrical (right-left) with a so-called anteroposterior distribution (head to tail), the starfish and its relatives are nothing like this. All exhibit five-fold radial symmetry. As for the location of the head and tail, no one knew until now.Researchers from American (Stanford, Berkeley and Columbia), British (Southampton) and Japanese (Okinawa) universities have just unraveled the mystery. ""Basically, we can say that the starfish is just a head,"" summed up Laurent Formery, a French postdoctoral student at Stanford and lead author of the Nature article announcing this result. To establish this, the scientists relied on molecular studies. Where anatomy had hitherto failed, genes have made it possible to draw a conclusion.Formery and his colleagues set out to map gene expression in the animal. Using two cutting-edge techniques – RNA tomography and in situ hybridization – they were able to track the activity of some of these genes and see how the traditional head/trunk/tail distribution observed in bilateral species was reflected in starfish. In fact, the same genes code for these different major body parts throughout living things.Unexpected results emerged. The prevailing hypothesis, that each arm should reproduce the classic head-to-tail unfolding, was overturned. Instead, the researchers observed that the head genes were expressed along the entire length of the animal's arms. Head everywhere, but trunk and tail nowhere. In fact, they found none of the molecular markers associated with those body parts.

"Russian ISS segment suffers third leak in under a year, but crew reported safe","    The Nauka module was launched in 2021, and is also known as the Multipurpose Laboratory Module-Upgrade (MLM). ","The Russian segment of the International Space Station (ISS) sprung its third coolant leak in under a year Monday, raising new questions about the reliability of the country's space program even as officials said crew members were not in danger.Flakes of frozen coolant spraying into space were seen in an official live feed of the orbital lab provided by NASA around 1:30 pm Eastern Time (5:30 pm GMT), and confirmed in radio chatter between US mission control and astronauts.""The Nauka module of the Russian segment of the ISS has suffered a coolant leak from the external (backup) radiator circuit, which was delivered to the station in 2012,"" Russian space agency Roscosmos said on Telegram, adding temperatures remained normal in the affected unit. ""Nothing is threatening the crew and the station,"" added the statement.Nauka, which means ""science"" in Russian and is also known as the Multipurpose Laboratory Module-Upgrade (MLM), launched in 2021.US mission control in Houston could be heard asking astronauts on the American side to investigate.""Hi, we're seeing flakes outside, we need a crew to go to the cupola, we think windows five or six, and confirm any visual flakes,"" an official said to the astronauts. ""There's a leak coming from the radiator on MLM,"" NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli replied a little later.NASA later confirmed the events in a statement Monday, saying that ""the crew aboard (the) station was never in any danger,"" and that the leak was coming from Nauka's backup radiator.""The primary radiator on Nauka is working normally, providing full cooling to the module with no impacts to the crew or to space station operations,"" NASA said, adding that the crew ""was asked to close the shutters on US segment windows as a precaution against contamination.""This is the third coolant leak to hit the Russian side of the ISS in less than a year.On December 15, 2022, dramatic NASA TV images showed white particles resembling snowflakes streaming out of the rear of a docked Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft for several hours. Speculation about the cause centered on an unlucky strike by a tiny space rock, or micro meteorite.That spaceship returned to Earth uncrewed, and then another uncrewed Soyuz was sent to replace it a few months later. Two Russians and an American crew had to stay for a year-long mission as a result, returning home only last month.A similar leak in mid-February also affected the Russian Progress MS-21 cargo ship, which had been docked to the ISS since October 2022. The succession of leaks lowers the probability they were caused by meteorites.Space analyst Jonathan McDowell told AFP: ""You've got three coolant systems leaking – there's a common thread there. One is whatever, two is a coincidence, three is something systematic,"" he said, speculating that a subcontractor company may be at fault.""It really just emphasizes the degrading reliability of Russian space systems.

'Europe's space project has overcome its contradictions and rivalries by reinventing itself at a key moment in its history',"At the close of the European Space Summit in Seville on November 6 and 7, the launcher crisis remains acute. But the Europeans have mapped out the technological and industrial future of Europe's space project with ambitious views on climate and the environment, writes Philippe Baptiste, president of the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, in an op-ed for 'Le Monde.'","The European Space Summit in Seville, which ended on Tuesday, November 7, saw agreement reached on ambitious objectives, notably around the use of space for climate and environmental preservation. It also answered two fundamental questions posed by the French president in Toulouse in 2022: What is Europe's ambition in terms of exploration? What is the future of Europe's Ariane and Vega launchers?Europe is a space leader in Earth observation, with major programs such as Copernicus, which provides valuable satellite data for our environment. For decades, European satellites have been continuously scanning the Earth, and it's thanks to them that we can measure and understand changes in climate, our environment and biodiversity.To provide a concrete response to climate change, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales [CNES] has also created the Space for Climate Observatory. With 44 international partners, we cross-reference space data with in situ observations to produce analysis and simulation tools that enable populations to adapt locally to climate change.We are putting in place simple solutions that enable us, for example, to assess water resources, monitor coastlines and control the risk of coastal flooding. In Seville, Europe made these issues a top political priority, enabling it to maintain its scientific, technical and industrial leadership.The European Union [EU] has also looked at the space race, and Europe's space project has overcome its contradictions and rivalries by reinventing itself at a key moment in its history. At a time when SpaceX is hammering away that its Starship will ""make mankind a multi-planetary species,"" India, meanwhile, has successfully completed the lunar landing of Chandrayaan-3, while China has sent a crew of young astronauts to its space station. These sometimes excessive ambitions are a reminder of the geostrategic stakes inherent in space exploration. What role should Europe play in this race towards what could be a ""new frontier""?Seville marked an important first step towards strengthening Europe's autonomy in exploration. While maintaining strong cooperation with our American partners, Europe needs to catch up and assert its leadership in key segments, starting with control of low-Earth orbit.We'll do this by mobilizing European manufacturers like ArianeGroup or Thales Alenia Space and start-ups like Space Cargo Unlimited or The Exploration Company, which design space capsules.

"For the first time, a whole eye has been transplanted","    An American team accomplished a partial double transplant of a face and one eye. Five months on, the surgery has been a success, even though the patient's vision has not been restored. ","It's a new step in the history of face transplants. The first partial face and whole eye transplant took place on May 27 at New York Langone University Hospital (NYU) in the United States, the medical team announced at a press conference on Thursday, November 9.The patient, Aaron James, 46, an Arkansas resident and US veteran, was electrocuted in June 2021 by over 7,000 volts while working on a high-voltage line. The accident resulted, among other things, in the loss of his left eye, nose, mouth, chin and teeth, as well as part of his left arm.Supervised by Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, the plastic surgeon in charge of NYU's facial transplant program, the project was conceived as early as August 2022. The ambitious plan mobilized 140 people from all specializations.Since the first face transplant in France in 2005, only 48 face transplants have been performed worldwide, according to a 2021 publication, and eyes have only been involved in partial transplants, mainly of the cornea. The few attempts to transplant a whole eye – some dating back to the 19th century – have failed, one of the main challenges being to reconnect the optic nerve to restore vision.So why try this procedure on James? In recent years, research has made significant progress in the use of immunosuppressive drugs, prescribed for life to avoid transplant rejection. But these drugs are not harmless: beyond the risk of infection, they are also likely to attack the kidneys or accelerate aging. ""Given Aaron needed a face transplant and will be taking immunosuppressive drugs regardless, the risk versus reward ratio of transplanting the eye was very low,"" Rodriguez explained in a press release.After just three months, a compatible donor was identified – size, skin color and biomarkers. To optimize the result, Rodriguez's team used cutting-edge technologies. The Belgian company Materialise, which specializes in 3D planning and the manufacture of made-to-measure medical devices, provided 3D models of the operation to come. It also designed custom 3D-printed cutting guides ""enabling us to take bone segments from the donor and place them precisely on the recipient, like a jigsaw puzzle,"" Rodriguez explained. The titanium screws holding the bones together were supplied by DePuy Synthes, a company owned by Johnson & Johnson.""The team practiced on numerous corpses to create the models and fully rehearse the procedure,"" explained Emily Jones, engineer at Materialise, who was involved in the project. ""On D-Day, we had 24 hours to receive the donor scans, print the custom cutting guides and adjust the surgical plan to the new data.""",Science,new step history face transplants first partial face whole eye transplant took place may new york langone university hospital nyu united states medical team announced press conference thursday november patient aaron james arkansas resident veteran electrocuted june volts working high voltage line accident resulted among things loss left eye nose mouth chin teeth well part left arm supervised eduardo rodriguez plastic surgeon charge nyus facial transplant program project conceived early august ambitious plan mobilized people specializations since first face transplant france face transplants performed worldwide according publication eyes involved partial transplants mainly cornea attempts transplant whole eye dating back century failed one main challenges reconnect optic nerve restore vision try procedure james recent years research made significant progress use immunosuppressive drugs prescribed life avoid transplant rejection drugs harmless beyond risk infection also likely attack kidneys accelerate aging given aaron needed face transplant taking immunosuppressive drugs regardless risk versus reward ratio transplanting eye low rodriguez explained press release three months compatible donor identified size skin color biomarkers optimize result rodriguezs team used cutting edge technologies belgian company materialise specializes planning manufacture made measure medical devices provided models operation come also designed custom printed cutting guides enabling take bone segments donor place precisely recipient like jigsaw puzzle rodriguez explained titanium screws holding bones together supplied depuy synthes company owned johnson johnson team practiced numerous corpses create models fully rehearse procedure explained emily jones engineer materialise involved project day hours receive donor scans print custom cutting guides adjust surgical plan new data,new step histori face transplant first partial face whole eye transplant took place may new york langon univers hospit nyu unit state medic team announc press confer thursday novemb patient aaron jame arkansa resid veteran electrocut june volt work high voltag line accid result among thing loss left eye nose mouth chin teeth well part left arm supervis eduardo rodriguez plastic surgeon charg nyu facial transplant program project conceiv earli august ambiti plan mobil peopl special sinc first face transplant franc face transplant perform worldwid accord public eye involv partial transplant mainli cornea attempt transplant whole eye date back centuri fail one main challeng reconnect optic nerv restor vision tri procedur jame recent year research made signific progress use immunosuppress drug prescrib life avoid transplant reject drug harmless beyond risk infect also like attack kidney acceler age given aaron need face transplant take immunosuppress drug regardless risk versu reward ratio transplant eye low rodriguez explain press releas three month compat donor identifi size skin color biomark optim result rodriguez team use cut edg technolog belgian compani materialis special plan manufactur made measur medic devic provid model oper come also design custom print cut guid enabl take bone segment donor place precis recipi like jigsaw puzzl rodriguez explain titanium screw hold bone togeth suppli depuy synth compani own johnson johnson team practic numer corps creat model fulli rehears procedur explain emili jone engin materialis involv project day hour receiv donor scan print custom cut guid adjust surgic plan new data
France bans wearing Islamic abaya dresses in schools,"    French Education Minister Gabriel Attal justified the decision, citing a violation of French secular laws. The decision has reignited a longstanding debate in France over religious freedom and civil liberties. ","French authorities are to ban the wearing in school premises of abaya dresses worn by some Muslim students, the education minister said Sunday, August 27, arguing the garment violated France's strict secular laws in education.""It will no longer be possible to wear an abaya at school,"" Education Minister Gabriel Attal told TF1 television, saying he would give ""clear rules at the national level"" to school heads ahead of the return to classes nationwide from September 4.The move comes after months of debate over the wearing of abayas in French schools, where girls have long been banned from wearing the Islamic headscarf. The right and far right had pushed for the ban, which the left argued would infringe on civil liberties. There have been reports of abayas being increasingly worn in schools and tensions within schools over the issue between teachers and parents.""Secularism means the freedom to emancipate oneself through school,"" Attal said, describing the abaya as ""a religious gesture, aimed at testing the resistance of the republic toward the secular sanctuary that school must constitute. ""You enter a classroom; you must not be able to identify the students' religion by looking at them,"" he said.A law of March 2004 banned ""the wearing of signs or outfits by which students ostensibly show a religious affiliation"" in schools. This includes large crosses, Jewish kippas, and Islamic headscarves. Unlike headscarves, abayas – a long, baggy garment worn to comply with Islamic beliefs on a modest dress – occupied a grey area and had faced no outright ban until now.However, the education ministry had already issued guidelines on the issue in November last year. It described the abaya as one of a group of clothing items whose wearing could be banned if ""worn in a manner as to display a religious affiliation openly."" The note put bandanas and long skirts in the same category.Approached by head teachers' unions about the issue, Attal's predecessor Pap Ndiaye had said he did not want ""to publish endless catalogs to specify the lengths of dresses.""At least one union leader welcomed Attal's announcement on Sunday. ""The instructions were unclear; now they are, and we welcome it,"" said Bruno Bobkiewicz, general secretary of the NPDEN-UNSA union representing head teachers.The president of the opposition's right-wing Les Républicains party, Eric Ciotti, welcomed the news. ""We called for the ban on abayas in our schools several times,"" he said.Clémentine Autain of the left-wing La France Insoumise party denounced a ""policing of clothing."" She said Attal's announcement was ""unconstitutional"" and against the founding principles of France's secular values.The debate has intensified since a radicalized Chechen refugee beheaded a teacher, Samuel Paty, who had shown students caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad near his school in a Paris suburb in 2020.The Conseil Français du Culte Musulman, a national body encompassing many Muslim associations, said clothing items alone are not ""a religious sign.""The announcement is the first major move by Attal, 34, since he was promoted this summer to handle the hugely contentious education portfolio. Along with Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, 40, he is seen as a rising star who could potentially play an important role after Macron steps down in 2027.",Religions,french authorities ban wearing school premises abaya dresses worn muslim students education minister said sunday august arguing garment violated frances strict secular laws education longer possible wear abaya school education minister gabriel attal told television saying would give clear rules national level school heads ahead return classes nationwide september move comes months debate wearing abayas french schools girls long banned wearing islamic headscarf right far right pushed ban left argued would infringe civil liberties reports abayas increasingly worn schools tensions within schools issue teachers parents secularism means freedom emancipate oneself school attal said describing abaya religious gesture aimed testing resistance republic toward secular sanctuary school must constitute enter classroom must able identify students religion looking said law march banned wearing signs outfits students ostensibly show religious affiliation schools includes large crosses jewish kippas islamic headscarves unlike headscarves abayas long baggy garment worn comply islamic beliefs modest dress occupied grey area faced outright ban however education ministry already issued guidelines issue november last year described abaya one group clothing items whose wearing could banned worn manner display religious affiliation openly note put bandanas long skirts category approached head teachers unions issue attals predecessor pap ndiaye said want publish endless catalogs specify lengths dresses least one union leader welcomed attals announcement sunday instructions unclear welcome said bruno bobkiewicz general secretary npden unsa union representing head teachers president oppositions right wing les publicains party eric ciotti welcomed news called ban abayas schools several times said mentine autain left wing france insoumise party denounced policing clothing said attals announcement unconstitutional founding principles frances secular values debate intensified since radicalized chechen refugee beheaded teacher samuel paty shown students caricatures prophet muhammad near school paris suburb conseil fran ais culte musulman national body encompassing many muslim associations said clothing items alone religious sign announcement first major move attal since promoted summer handle hugely contentious education portfolio along interior minister gerald darmanin seen rising star could potentially play important role macron steps,french author ban wear school premis abaya dress worn muslim student educ minist said sunday august argu garment violat franc strict secular law educ longer possibl wear abaya school educ minist gabriel attal told televis say would give clear rule nation level school head ahead return class nationwid septemb move come month debat wear abaya french school girl long ban wear islam headscarf right far right push ban left argu would infring civil liberti report abaya increasingli worn school tension within school issu teacher parent secular mean freedom emancip oneself school attal said describ abaya religi gestur aim test resist republ toward secular sanctuari school must constitut enter classroom must abl identifi student religion look said law march ban wear sign outfit student ostens show religi affili school includ larg cross jewish kippa islam headscarv unlik headscarv abaya long baggi garment worn compli islam belief modest dress occupi grey area face outright ban howev educ ministri alreadi issu guidelin issu novemb last year describ abaya one group cloth item whose wear could ban worn manner display religi affili openli note put bandana long skirt categori approach head teacher union issu attal predecessor pap ndiay said want publish endless catalog specifi length dress least one union leader welcom attal announc sunday instruct unclear welcom said bruno bobkiewicz gener secretari npden unsa union repres head teacher presid opposit right wing le publicain parti eric ciotti welcom news call ban abaya school sever time said mentin autain left wing franc insoumis parti denounc polic cloth said attal announc unconstitut found principl franc secular valu debat intensifi sinc radic chechen refuge behead teacher samuel pati shown student caricatur prophet muhammad near school pari suburb conseil fran ai cult musulman nation bodi encompass mani muslim associ said cloth item alon religi sign announc first major move attal sinc promot summer handl huge contenti educ portfolio along interior minist gerald darmanin seen rise star could potenti play import role macron step
Ban on abayas in schools reopens the French left's historic split on secularism,"    France's far-left party La France Insoumise has announced its intention to appeal the ban, a government measure supported by some Socialists and the Communists. ","A new bone of contention has inflamed the French left, as Education Minister Gabriel Attal announced on August 27 the abaya would be banned from schools. ""Attacks on secularism have increased considerably,"" he justified, likening this long garment of Middle Eastern origin worn by young Muslim girls to a ""religious garment"" in the same way as the qamis, its equivalent worn by men.That's all it took to revive the divide over secularism on the left. ""Sad to see the start of the new school year politically polarized by yet another absurd and entirely artificial religious war over women's clothing,"" lamented La France Insoumise (LFI, hard-left) leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, calling for ""civil peace"" and ""true secularism that unites rather than exasperates"". LFI coordinator Manuel Bompard announced on French television channel France 2 on Tuesday morning his decision to challenge the ban at the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest administrative court.The line is the antithesis of that taken by the Communists and the Socialist Party (PS), which voted for the 2004 law banning religious symbols in schools. ""Our compass is the ban on ostensible signs in schools,"" retorted Socialist MP Jérôme Guedj, who is in favor of a ban on abayas. ""Secularism is, along with Europe, the most divisive issue on the left,"" political scientist Rémi Lefebvre pointed out. ""A large portion of the PS sticks to a fairly strict secularism and part of LFI and the ecologists have a more accommodating conception of it in the name of defending minorities – and well-understood electoral interests,"" according to Jérôme Fourquet, director of the Opinion department at IFOP, the French institute of public opinion.""As soon as the abaya or qamis are worn in an ostentatious way, they should be banned, as the 2004 law allows, without any major difficulties,"" said Guedj, drawing the wrath of MP Nadège Abomangoli (LFI). ""A European list with this? No thanks,"" she replied on X (formerly Twitter) referring to the June 2024 European elections.At the heart of the controversy is whether or not the clothing is religious. For Guedj, who urges his partners on the left to ""not be angelic,"" there is no doubt. ""There are people with a political project to challenge secularism,"" he says.

"'Religious freedom is real in Mongolia, despite an alliance between Buddhism and the government'","    As Pope Francis visits Mongolia, which boasts one of the world's smallest Catholic communities,  anthropologist Grégory Delaplace analyzes the stakes of his trip through the prism of the country's religious situation. ","Pope Francis will be in Mongolia from Thursday, August 31, until Monday, September 4. This is the first visit by a pope to this East Asian country, which boasts one of the world's smallest Catholic communities, with only some 1,500 followers out of a population of three million. Situated between Russia, of which it was a satellite at the time of the Soviet Union, and China, its main trading partner, Mongolia is an important diplomatic intermediary for the Holy See.But this former Soviet country also represents a high-potential mission land for Francis, who intends to put the Church's ""outskirts"" back in the spotlight. In August 2022, the Pope made the Italian missionary Giorgio Marengo – the apostolic prefect of Oulan-Bator, the Mongolian capital – a cardinal, which, at 48, made him the world's youngest. But is there really room for the development of Catholicism in Mongolia? In an interview with Le Monde, anthropologist Grégory Delaplace analyzed the country's religious landscape, which has been constantly reshaped by the upheavals of history.The most present and influential religion is undoubtedly the Gelug school of Buddhism, known as the ""yellow hat"" school – in reference to the color of the clothing worn by monks and dignitaries. This is the school of which the Dalai Lama is the highest representative, a fact which has led to recurrent tensions with China.Between 1921 and 1924, before the establishment of a socialist republic based on the Soviet model, Mongolia was even a veritable theocracy for a few years, ruled by a high dignitary of Gelug Buddhism. The influence of the Buddhist clergy was considerable. Benefiting from substantial donations, monasteries were not only rich and powerful places but also major centers of intellectual production. What's more, every family was required to send one child to a monastery. There was talk of a state within the state, which the socialist regime could not tolerate. This led to massive repression of the clergy in the 1930s.Today, monks are fewer in number and less powerful, but still very much present. The country's entire religious life is structured by Buddhist liturgy. During the Lunar New Year, for example, many Mongolians continue to visit monasteries to prepare for the coming year, find out about potential obstacles to prosperity, find out whether they'll be lucky, what they should avoid doing, perform rituals to compensate for unfavorable astrological configurations, and more.",Religions,pope francis mongolia thursday august monday september first visit pope east asian country boasts one worlds smallest catholic communities followers population three million situated russia satellite time soviet union china main trading partner mongolia important diplomatic intermediary holy see former soviet country also represents high potential mission land francis intends put churchs outskirts back spotlight august pope made italian missionary giorgio marengo apostolic prefect oulan bator mongolian capital cardinal made worlds youngest really room development catholicism mongolia interview monde anthropologist gory delaplace analyzed countrys religious landscape constantly reshaped upheavals history present influential religion undoubtedly gelug school buddhism known yellow hat school reference color clothing worn monks dignitaries school dalai lama highest representative fact led recurrent tensions china establishment socialist republic based soviet model mongolia even veritable theocracy years ruled high dignitary gelug buddhism influence buddhist clergy considerable benefiting substantial donations monasteries rich powerful places also major centers intellectual production whats every family required send one child monastery talk state within state socialist regime could tolerate led massive repression clergy today monks fewer number less powerful still much present countrys entire religious life structured buddhist liturgy lunar new year example many mongolians continue visit monasteries prepare coming year find potential obstacles prosperity find whether theyll lucky avoid perform rituals compensate unfavorable astrological configurations,pope franci mongolia thursday august monday septemb first visit pope east asian countri boast one world smallest cathol commun follow popul three million situat russia satellit time soviet union china main trade partner mongolia import diplomat intermediari holi see former soviet countri also repres high potenti mission land franci intend put church outskirt back spotlight august pope made italian missionari giorgio marengo apostol prefect oulan bator mongolian capit cardin made world youngest realli room develop catholic mongolia interview mond anthropologist gori delaplac analyz countri religi landscap constantli reshap upheav histori present influenti religion undoubtedli gelug school buddhism known yellow hat school refer color cloth worn monk dignitari school dalai lama highest repres fact led recurr tension china establish socialist republ base soviet model mongolia even verit theocraci year rule high dignitari gelug buddhism influenc buddhist clergi consider benefit substanti donat monasteri rich power place also major center intellectu product what everi famili requir send one child monasteri talk state within state socialist regim could toler led massiv repress clergi today monk fewer number less power still much present countri entir religi life structur buddhist liturgi lunar new year exampl mani mongolian continu visit monasteri prepar come year find potenti obstacl prosper find whether theyll lucki avoid perform ritual compens unfavor astrolog configur
Pope to meet tiny Catholic community of Mongolia,    Francis' visit from September 1 to September 4 marks the desert country's first-ever visit from a pontiff. The nation's geographical situation – sandwiched between Russia and China – could be the reason the Vatican wants to put it on its map. ,"Virtually nobody could believe it when the news began circulating back in December 2022. Why would Pope Francis visit Mongolia, a country no pontiff ever visited before? The country's history and heritage are certainly legendary, since the time of Genghis Khan, who founded an empire stretching from China to the eastern fringes of Europe, and whose influence is still felt today. Relations between the Holy See and the Mongol nation date back to 1246, when Innocent IV sent an emissary to Karakorum, then the capital of the Mongol Empire. However, on the eve of the 43rd apostolic visit undertaken by 86-year-old Pope Francis from September 1 to 4, many observers are still at pains to explain this long journey.The world's least densely populated country has a small Catholic community, with just under 1,400 faithful out of a population of 3.3 million. But no matter. Instead of putting Western nations at the center of his geography, Francis, according to a Vatican diplomatic source, has chosen to visit the world's outer reaches, to which he wishes to give as much if not more importance than to the ""major"" Catholic countries.In August 2022, Francis appointed Giorgio Marengo, an Italian missionary and now apostolic prefect of Ulaanbaatar, the current capital of Mongolia, to the position of cardinal. At the age of 49, Marengo is the youngest elector in the body that will, in due course, elect the next pope. This gesture comes at a time when Mongolian Catholics are too few in number to have their own diocese. Another argument in favor of a papal visit is the country's tradition of religious tolerance, which the head of the Catholic Church will no doubt highlight in his speeches. An ecumenical and interfaith meeting is scheduled for Sunday, September 3.A third and main argument is the position occupied by this immense desert country, although not one mentioned prominently in the Vatican. The only parliamentary democracy in the region, Mongolia lies between two authoritarian regimes at the heart of the Vatican's concerns, namely Russia and China, with which Pope Francis would like to develop a more direct relationship. In September 2022, he visited Kazakhstan, hoping to meet Kirill, the patriarch of Moscow, to discuss the war in Ukraine. The Orthodox leader, who is close to Vladimir Putin and has described Russian aggression as a ""fight against the forces of evil,"" never showed up.No one knows whether Francis will take advantage of his trip to Mongolia (a decision taken after the invasion of Ukraine) to try and send a message to the Russians. Routinely criticized for his positions, which never fail to embrace Russia and place the aggressor and victim on an equal footing, Francis once again provoked the anger of Ukrainians on August 25. In a televised address to the Russian Youth Days held in St. Petersburg, the pontiff encouraged young people to be the ""heirs of the great Russia of Peter the Great and Catherine II,"" and praised the Empire's great culture and humanity, which many have seen as an expression of admiration for Russian imperialism.",Religions,virtually nobody could believe news began circulating back december would pope francis visit mongolia country pontiff ever visited countrys history heritage certainly legendary since time genghis khan founded empire stretching china eastern fringes europe whose influence still felt today relations holy see mongol nation date back innocent sent emissary karakorum capital mongol empire however eve apostolic visit undertaken year old pope francis september many observers still pains explain long journey worlds least densely populated country small catholic community faithful population million matter instead putting western nations center geography francis according vatican diplomatic source chosen visit worlds outer reaches wishes give much importance major catholic countries august francis appointed giorgio marengo italian missionary apostolic prefect ulaanbaatar current capital mongolia position cardinal age marengo youngest elector body due course elect next pope gesture comes time mongolian catholics number diocese another argument favor papal visit countrys tradition religious tolerance head catholic church doubt highlight speeches ecumenical interfaith meeting scheduled sunday september third main argument position occupied immense desert country although one mentioned prominently vatican parliamentary democracy region mongolia lies two authoritarian regimes heart vaticans concerns namely russia china pope francis would like develop direct relationship september visited kazakhstan hoping meet kirill patriarch moscow discuss war ukraine orthodox leader close vladimir putin described russian aggression fight forces evil never showed one knows whether francis take advantage trip mongolia decision taken invasion ukraine try send message russians routinely criticized positions never fail embrace russia place aggressor victim equal footing francis provoked anger ukrainians august televised address russian youth days held petersburg pontiff encouraged young people heirs great russia peter great catherine praised empires great culture humanity many seen expression admiration russian imperialism,virtual nobodi could believ news began circul back decemb would pope franci visit mongolia countri pontiff ever visit countri histori heritag certainli legendari sinc time genghi khan found empir stretch china eastern fring europ whose influenc still felt today relat holi see mongol nation date back innoc sent emissari karakorum capit mongol empir howev eve apostol visit undertaken year old pope franci septemb mani observ still pain explain long journey world least dens popul countri small cathol commun faith popul million matter instead put western nation center geographi franci accord vatican diplomat sourc chosen visit world outer reach wish give much import major cathol countri august franci appoint giorgio marengo italian missionari apostol prefect ulaanbaatar current capit mongolia posit cardin age marengo youngest elector bodi due cours elect next pope gestur come time mongolian cathol number dioces anoth argument favor papal visit countri tradit religi toler head cathol church doubt highlight speech ecumen interfaith meet schedul sunday septemb third main argument posit occupi immens desert countri although one mention promin vatican parliamentari democraci region mongolia lie two authoritarian regim heart vatican concern name russia china pope franci would like develop direct relationship septemb visit kazakhstan hope meet kiril patriarch moscow discuss war ukrain orthodox leader close vladimir putin describ russian aggress fight forc evil never show one know whether franci take advantag trip mongolia decis taken invas ukrain tri send messag russian routin critic posit never fail embrac russia place aggressor victim equal foot franci provok anger ukrainian august televis address russian youth day held petersburg pontiff encourag young peopl heir great russia peter great catherin prais empir great cultur human mani seen express admir russian imperi
Charlie Hebdo's lawyer: 'Penalizing Quran burnings means embarking on an extraordinarily dangerous path',"With Denmark planning to ban the public desecration of religious objects, Richard Malka protests against the country bowing to pressure from regimes such as Syria and Iran, which have little respect for human rights.","This is not happening in 17th century Denmark, but today. In 2023, progressive Denmark, the flower of European social democracy, will reinstate (while claiming otherwise) the crime of blasphemy − with imprisonment a possible punishment.Ironically, this medieval offense was removed from the Danish penal code just six years ago after a lengthy debate, putting an end to a 344-year ban on offending God. According to the justice minister, this U-turn is justified by national security imperatives. We're talking about the crisis of the Quran burnings, the latest season of the clash of civilizations, written by bad screenwriters. And since we never learn from the past, we fall for it, to the point of folly. It's not the trap set by a few activists that's maddening – we'll never be able to prevent that – but the lack of reflection, memory, perspective and moderation on the part of so many heads of state and religious dignitaries.Over the past few months, two Iraqi political refugees in Sweden, who claim to be atheists, have been carrying out spectacular Quran burnings in the presence of the press. They threaten to continue their desecrations, which have included trampling on the sacred book and inserting slices of bacon in its pages, until the Quran, which they consider ""more dangerous than nuclear weapons,"" is banned. At the very least, they call for the removal of ""the verses on murder."" But when it comes down to it, it doesn't really matter what their motives are.Far-right parties in Sweden and Denmark followed suit. These two countries, whose authorities have firmly condemned the Quran burners, were met with an avalanche of threatening rebukes. These came from regimes with leaders who seem to believe that if a person who expresses a transgressive opinion is not immediately burned (as in Pakistan), hanged (Iran) or beheaded ( Saudi Arabia), the country where they live must share their opinion. Accepting this insane logic, Denmark – and perhaps soon Sweden, which has repeatedly banned public burnings of the Quran this year – is proposing legislation to punish the ""improper treatment of objects of significant religious importance to a religious community"" with two years of imprisonment and a fine. It is as if thought had finally given in to religious pressure.Let's overlook the inclusion, obviously just for show, of Catholics and Jews in this affair. No doubt, they too feel wounded by the burning of their holy books, but we have no recollection of notable representatives of these religions calling for the imprisonment of the perpetrators of such acts. The second act of hypocrisy consists in claiming that the legislation would not restore the offense of blasphemy, since it is specified that ""verbal or written expression"" would not be covered by the law. Blasphemy can just as easily be committed by word, writing, drawing or gesture − such a distinction makes no sense.",Religions,happening century denmark today progressive denmark flower european social democracy reinstate claiming otherwise crime blasphemy imprisonment possible punishment ironically medieval offense removed danish penal code six years ago lengthy debate putting end year ban offending god according justice minister turn justified national security imperatives talking crisis quran burnings latest season clash civilizations written bad screenwriters since never learn past fall point folly trap set activists thats maddening well never able prevent lack reflection memory perspective moderation part many heads state religious dignitaries past months two iraqi political refugees sweden claim atheists carrying spectacular quran burnings presence press threaten continue desecrations included trampling sacred book inserting slices bacon pages quran consider dangerous nuclear weapons banned least call removal verses murder comes doesnt really matter motives far right parties sweden denmark followed suit two countries whose authorities firmly condemned quran burners met avalanche threatening rebukes came regimes leaders seem believe person expresses transgressive opinion immediately burned pakistan hanged iran beheaded saudi arabia country live must share opinion accepting insane logic denmark perhaps soon sweden repeatedly banned public burnings quran year proposing legislation punish improper treatment objects significant religious importance religious community two years imprisonment fine thought finally given religious pressure lets overlook inclusion obviously show catholics jews affair doubt feel wounded burning holy books recollection notable representatives religions calling imprisonment perpetrators acts second act hypocrisy consists claiming legislation would restore offense blasphemy since specified verbal written expression would covered law blasphemy easily committed word writing drawing gesture distinction makes sense,happen centuri denmark today progress denmark flower european social democraci reinstat claim otherwis crime blasphemi imprison possibl punish iron mediev offens remov danish penal code six year ago lengthi debat put end year ban offend god accord justic minist turn justifi nation secur imper talk crisi quran burn latest season clash civil written bad screenwrit sinc never learn past fall point folli trap set activist that madden well never abl prevent lack reflect memori perspect moder part mani head state religi dignitari past month two iraqi polit refuge sweden claim atheist carri spectacular quran burn presenc press threaten continu desecr includ trampl sacr book insert slice bacon page quran consid danger nuclear weapon ban least call remov vers murder come doesnt realli matter motiv far right parti sweden denmark follow suit two countri whose author firmli condemn quran burner met avalanch threaten rebuk came regim leader seem believ person express transgress opinion immedi burn pakistan hang iran behead saudi arabia countri live must share opinion accept insan logic denmark perhap soon sweden repeatedli ban public burn quran year propos legisl punish improp treatment object signific religi import religi commun two year imprison fine thought final given religi pressur let overlook inclus obvious show cathol jew affair doubt feel wound burn holi book recollect notabl repres religion call imprison perpetr act second act hypocrisi consist claim legisl would restor offens blasphemi sinc specifi verbal written express would cover law blasphemi easili commit word write draw gestur distinct make sens
Violent riot breaks out in Sweden at Koran burning protest,"    Sunday's protest was held in a square in the southern city of Malmo, which has a large immigrant population. Swedish police arrested two people and detained around 10 people after the riot broke out. ","Swedish police on Sunday, September 3, arrested two people and detained around 10 people after a violent riot broke out at a protest involving a burning of the Koran, police said.The protest was organized by Iraqi refugee Salwan Momika, whose protests – which have included public desecrations of the Muslim holy book – have sparked outrage across the Middle East.Sunday's protest was held in a square in the southern city of Malmo, which has a large immigrant population, and according to public broadcaster SVT around 200 people had showed up to watch. ""Some onlookers have shown upset feelings after the organizer burned writings,"" police said in a statement. ""The mood was at times heated,"" the statement said, adding that a ""violent riot"" occurred at 1:45 pm.According to police, the event had ended after the organizer left but a group of people remained at the scene. About 10 people were detained for disturbing the public order and another two were arrested, suspected of violent rioting.Local media reported that some onlookers threw rocks at Momika, and video from the scene showed some trying to break through the cordon before being stopped by police. In another video a man could be seen trying to stop the police car that transported Momika from the location by getting in front of it.Through a series of demonstrations, Momika has sparked anger directed at Sweden and diplomatic tensions between Sweden and several Middle Eastern countries.The Swedish government has condemned the desecrations of the Koran while noting the country's constitutionally protected freedom of speech and assembly laws.Iraqi protesters stormed the Swedish embassy in Baghdad twice in July, starting fires within the compound on the second occasion.Swedish envoys have also been summoned in a slew of Middle Eastern nations.In mid-August, Sweden's intelligence agency heightened its terror alert level to four on a scale of five, noting that Sweden had ""gone from being considered a legitimate target for terrorist attacks to being considered a prioritized target.""",Religions,swedish police sunday september arrested two people detained around people violent riot broke protest involving burning koran police said protest organized iraqi refugee salwan momika whose protests included public desecrations muslim holy book sparked outrage across middle east sundays protest held square southern city malmo large immigrant population according public broadcaster svt around people showed watch onlookers shown upset feelings organizer burned writings police said statement mood times heated statement said adding violent riot occurred according police event ended organizer left group people remained scene people detained disturbing public order another two arrested suspected violent rioting local media reported onlookers threw rocks momika video scene showed trying break cordon stopped police another video man could seen trying stop police car transported momika location getting front series demonstrations momika sparked anger directed sweden diplomatic tensions sweden several middle eastern countries swedish government condemned desecrations koran noting countrys constitutionally protected freedom speech assembly laws iraqi protesters stormed swedish embassy baghdad twice july starting fires within compound second occasion swedish envoys also summoned slew middle eastern nations mid august swedens intelligence agency heightened terror alert level four scale five noting sweden gone considered legitimate target terrorist attacks considered prioritized target,swedish polic sunday septemb arrest two peopl detain around peopl violent riot broke protest involv burn koran polic said protest organ iraqi refuge salwan momika whose protest includ public desecr muslim holi book spark outrag across middl east sunday protest held squar southern citi malmo larg immigr popul accord public broadcast svt around peopl show watch onlook shown upset feel organ burn write polic said statement mood time heat statement said ad violent riot occur accord polic event end organ left group peopl remain scene peopl detain disturb public order anoth two arrest suspect violent riot local media report onlook threw rock momika video scene show tri break cordon stop polic anoth video man could seen tri stop polic car transport momika locat get front seri demonstr momika spark anger direct sweden diplomat tension sweden sever middl eastern countri swedish govern condemn desecr koran note countri constitut protect freedom speech assembl law iraqi protest storm swedish embassi baghdad twice juli start fire within compound second occas swedish envoy also summon slew middl eastern nation mid august sweden intellig agenc heighten terror alert level four scale five note sweden gone consid legitim target terrorist attack consid priorit target
Brazil's Serra da Capivara cave paintings are under threat,Feature,"Was prehistory a party? Judging by the cave paintings in Brazil's Serra da Capivara, we'd be tempted to say yes. On fragile arenite walls, human figures frolic amid deer, armadillos, crabs and rodents. Some appear to be dancing and swaying, forming cheerful pyramids, arms outstretched to the sky. Others, their phalluses erect, are in the midst of a sexual act.Seen from here, in the state of Piaui, on the edge of the Nordeste region, everything seems lovely and voluptuous. At first glance, the Serra da Capivara National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site and archaeological jewel of the Americas, conjures up a vision of blissful effervescence, with its more than 1,000 sites of cave paintings and engravings dating back 6,000 to 12,000 years. Hence its well-deserved nickname of the ""Brazilian Lascaux.""While the scenes depicted are open to infinite interpretation, their artistic value is not up for debate. As in a cinema, everything here is movement: Characters run and leap and styles intermingle, from ochre pigment (from hematite, an iron oxide) to milky white (from gypsum). The technique used to fix them to the rock remains a mystery. Some researchers suspect the use of a mixture of animal fat, sap and even saliva and blood.But the Capivara is much more than an open-air gallery of prehistoric art. It's also a 130,000-hectare environmental reserve, crisscrossed by glowing canyons and carpeted by the Caatinga, meaning ""white forest"" in the indigenous Tupi language, an ecosystem of thorny brush and leafless shrubs. Snakes and rodents, giant anteaters and spotted jaguars roam between the frescoes.Everything is done to attract tourists: perfectly groomed trails, wooden platforms, disabled access, nighttime illuminations and themed signage. There were 16,000 vistors in the first quarter, 35% more than in 2022. Two weekly flights reach the nearby town of Sao Raimundo Nonato and its airport in the (approximate) shape of a capivara (capybara), the huge, placid rodent that gives the park its name.And that's not all: The remote Serra da Capivara is home to six research laboratories and a campus of the Federal University of the Sao Francisco Valley (UNIVASF), which offers several master's degrees. It is also the location of a number of cultural institutions, including the very modern spiral-shaped Nature Museum, which traces the biological history of the planet. Cycling races, hiking trails and even opera concerts are organized between the canyons.",Science,prehistory party judging cave paintings brazils serra capivara wed tempted say yes fragile arenite walls human figures frolic amid deer armadillos crabs rodents appear dancing swaying forming cheerful pyramids arms outstretched sky others phalluses erect midst sexual act seen state piaui edge nordeste region everything seems lovely voluptuous first glance serra capivara national park unesco world heritage site archaeological jewel americas conjures vision blissful effervescence sites cave paintings engravings dating back years hence well deserved nickname brazilian lascaux scenes open infinite interpretation artistic value debate cinema everything movement characters run leap styles intermingle ochre pigment hematite iron oxide milky white gypsum technique used fix rock remains mystery researchers suspect use mixture animal fat sap even saliva blood capivara much open air gallery prehistoric art also hectare environmental reserve crisscrossed glowing canyons carpeted caatinga meaning white forest indigenous tupi language ecosystem thorny brush leafless shrubs snakes rodents giant anteaters spotted jaguars roam frescoes everything done attract tourists perfectly groomed trails wooden platforms disabled access nighttime illuminations themed signage vistors first quarter two weekly flights reach nearby town sao raimundo nonato airport approximate shape capivara capybara huge placid rodent gives park name thats remote serra capivara home six research laboratories campus federal university sao francisco valley univasf offers several masters degrees also location number cultural institutions including modern spiral shaped nature museum traces biological history planet cycling races hiking trails even opera concerts organized canyons,prehistori parti judg cave paint brazil serra capivara wed tempt say ye fragil arenit wall human figur frolic amid deer armadillo crab rodent appear danc sway form cheer pyramid arm outstretch sky other phallus erect midst sexual act seen state piaui edg nordest region everyth seem love voluptu first glanc serra capivara nation park unesco world heritag site archaeolog jewel america conjur vision bliss effervesc site cave paint engrav date back year henc well deserv nicknam brazilian lascaux scene open infinit interpret artist valu debat cinema everyth movement charact run leap style intermingl ochr pigment hematit iron oxid milki white gypsum techniqu use fix rock remain mysteri research suspect use mixtur anim fat sap even saliva blood capivara much open air galleri prehistor art also hectar environment reserv crisscross glow canyon carpet caatinga mean white forest indigen tupi languag ecosystem thorni brush leafless shrub snake rodent giant anteat spot jaguar roam fresco everyth done attract tourist perfectli groom trail wooden platform disabl access nighttim illumin theme signag vistor first quarter two weekli flight reach nearbi town sao raimundo nonato airport approxim shape capivara capybara huge placid rodent give park name that remot serra capivara home six research laboratori campu feder univers sao francisco valley univasf offer sever master degre also locat number cultur institut includ modern spiral shape natur museum trace biolog histori planet cycl race hike trail even opera concert organ canyon
"In Mongolia, Pope Francis asks Chinese Catholics to be 'good citizens'","    The head of the Catholic Church addressed the faithful of Mongolia's neighboring country after a mass on Sunday, the penultimate day of his visit to Ulaanbaatar. ","On the field hockey rink of Ulaanbaatar's Steppe Arena, an impressive wooden cross stood on the red stage. Stylized Mongolian-style flowers adorned the sculpture. In their purple outfits and straw hats, young girls, who came especially from Vietnam, awaited the arrival of Pope Francis on stage. In the blue and yellow bleachers, the faithful from several Asian countries attended the mass celebrated by the head of the Catholic Church on Sunday, September 3, as part of his apostolic visit to Mongolia, a country whose 1,400 Catholics were insufficient in number to fill the 2,000 seats in the stadium.It was China, which shares 4,677 kilometers of border with Mongolia, that the pontiff was thinking of on Sunday, more than any other Asian nations represented in the audience. During his traditional popemobile tour before mass, the Argentine pope stopped in front of a large Chinese flag held by the faithful who had come to meet him from their home country. An hour and a half later, at the end of mass, the standing pope gave one hand to Cardinal-designate Stephen Chow, bishop of Hong Kong, and the other to Chow's predecessor, Cardinal John Tong. With the two prelates at his side, the pontiff addressed the Chinese faithful, and no doubt also the country's government: ""I would like to take this opportunity, in the presence of these two brother bishops (...), to send a heartfelt greeting to the noble Chinese people. (...) I ask Chinese Catholics to be good Christians and good citizens.""In China, Catholics are tightly controlled and even repressed by the authorities. To improve their situation, the Vatican under Francis has endeavored to find common ground with the Beijing government. In 2018, the two sides reached an agreement – renewed twice since – whose letter remains secret ,but which institutes a shared procedure for appointing bishops. Its aim is to bring closer together the official Church, whose hierarchs were appointed by Beijing, and the underground Church, whose prelates were chosen by Rome.Since his election, Francis has also repeatedly expressed his desire to be able to visit China, and has offered Bejing signs of his willingness to do so. His recommendation to the country's faithful to be ""good citizens"" fits into this framework. ""The idea is to reassure the Chinese government that Catholics are not destined to become dissidents,"" said Michel Chambon, a researcher at the Asia Research Institute, University of Singapore. The Vatican sees Chow, recently appointed cardinal, as a bridge between Rome and Beijing. The prelate visited the Chinese capital in April and is due to return soon. However, without authorization from Beijing, no Chinese Catholic prelate could travel to Mongolia for Francis' visit.",Religions,field hockey rink ulaanbaatars steppe arena impressive wooden cross stood red stage stylized mongolian style flowers adorned sculpture purple outfits straw hats young girls came especially vietnam awaited arrival pope francis stage blue yellow bleachers faithful several asian countries attended mass celebrated head catholic church sunday september part apostolic visit mongolia country whose catholics insufficient number fill seats stadium china shares kilometers border mongolia pontiff thinking sunday asian nations represented audience traditional popemobile tour mass argentine pope stopped front large chinese flag held faithful come meet home country hour half later end mass standing pope gave one hand cardinal designate stephen chow bishop hong kong chows predecessor cardinal john tong two prelates side pontiff addressed chinese faithful doubt also countrys government would like take opportunity presence two brother bishops send heartfelt greeting noble chinese people ask chinese catholics good christians good citizens china catholics tightly controlled even repressed authorities improve situation vatican francis endeavored find common ground beijing government two sides reached agreement renewed twice since whose letter remains secret institutes shared procedure appointing bishops aim bring closer together official church whose hierarchs appointed beijing underground church whose prelates chosen rome since election francis also repeatedly expressed desire able visit china offered bejing signs willingness recommendation countrys faithful good citizens fits framework idea reassure chinese government catholics destined become dissidents said michel chambon researcher asia research institute university singapore vatican sees chow recently appointed cardinal bridge rome beijing prelate visited chinese capital april due return soon however without authorization beijing chinese catholic prelate could travel mongolia francis visit,field hockey rink ulaanbaatar stepp arena impress wooden cross stood red stage styliz mongolian style flower adorn sculptur purpl outfit straw hat young girl came especi vietnam await arriv pope franci stage blue yellow bleacher faith sever asian countri attend mass celebr head cathol church sunday septemb part apostol visit mongolia countri whose cathol insuffici number fill seat stadium china share kilomet border mongolia pontiff think sunday asian nation repres audienc tradit popemobil tour mass argentin pope stop front larg chines flag held faith come meet home countri hour half later end mass stand pope gave one hand cardin design stephen chow bishop hong kong chow predecessor cardin john tong two prelat side pontiff address chines faith doubt also countri govern would like take opportun presenc two brother bishop send heartfelt greet nobl chines peopl ask chines cathol good christian good citizen china cathol tightli control even repress author improv situat vatican franci endeavor find common ground beij govern two side reach agreement renew twice sinc whose letter remain secret institut share procedur appoint bishop aim bring closer togeth offici church whose hierarch appoint beij underground church whose prelat chosen rome sinc elect franci also repeatedli express desir abl visit china offer beje sign willing recommend countri faith good citizen fit framework idea reassur chines govern cathol destin becom dissid said michel chambon research asia research institut univers singapor vatican see chow recent appoint cardin bridg rome beij prelat visit chines capit april due return soon howev without author beij chines cathol prelat could travel mongolia franci visit
French satirical newspaper 'Charlie Hebdo' blasts proposed Danish blasphemy law,"    The French satirical weekly magazine is leading a protest against the return of a more than 300-year-old law, denouncing it as a regressive move influenced by authoritarian regimes and a threat to freedom of expression. ","Charlie Hebdo is back on crusading for freedom of expression. While the Danish government presented a bill to Parliament on Friday, September 1, banning public defacing of religious objects, the secular satirical French weekly is criticizing Copenhagen's decision to reinstate the crime of blasphemy. The subject will feature on the front page of the Wednesday, September 6, issue.The newspaper is launching an appeal to ""warn citizens committed to democratic values"" alongside eight Scandinavian media outlets. Among them, seven Norwegian newspapers and online sites and one Danish media outlet are criticizing the return of this 334-year-old law, which was repealed in 2017.In recent months, there has been one controversy after another in northern Europe, with Iraqi political refugees repeatedly burning Qurans in front of the press. The Scandinavian far right is exultant at other similar degradations carried out within its ranks. The emotion that swept through the Muslim world at these images of book burning led, for example, to a hundred people attacking the Swedish embassy in Baghdad on July 20.Against this backdrop of heightened tensions, Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard has championed a law designed to ""prohibit the inappropriate treatment of objects of significant religious significance to a religious community."" Anyone publicly desecrating a Bible, Torah, Quran or religious symbols such as a crucifix will soon face a fine or up to two years imprisonment.For the editorial staff of Charlie Hebdo, who were targeted by an Islamist attack on January 7, 2015, this ""ad hoc legislation"" is worrying. ""It's serious that a European country should decide to reinstate a medieval offense,"" warned the publication's director, Riss, who sees it as all the more symbolically important given that Denmark was the scene of the Muhammad cartoons affair in 2005.""In doing this, the Danish government is bowing to pressure from Muslim countries,"" complained Gérard Biard, the weekly's editor-in-chief. ""With this scandalous law, the Danish government is being dictated to by authoritarian regimes such as Iran, Saudi Arabia and Taliban Afghanistan. The vagueness surrounding this bill, which in reality concerns only the Quran, leaves the door open to all interpretations and therefore all penalties,"" even though the Danish minister of justice has assured that the law will not cover cartoons.By embarking on this new battle, and at the risk of being accused of encouraging book-burners, Charlie Hebdo will surprise neither its supporters nor its detractors. ""We're not trying to export French-style secularism but to support freedom of expression, which is threatened by this law. Everyone has the right to practise their religion, it's not about the Quran, it's about fighting religious fundamentalism,"" Riss said. The newspaper is currently in difficulty. Only 17,000 copies were sold on newsstands per week in August, compared with 20,000 in January 2023 and 25,000 in May 2022.

Pope Francis admits that 'taking a trip now is not as easy as in the beginning',"    During the return journey to Rome following his visit to Mongolia, Pope Francis suggested that he might soon stop traveling internationally. ","Recognizing the impacts of aging and the physical constraints it imposes can be particularly challenging, especially for a head of state or religious leader. But that's exactly what Pope Francis did on Monday, September 4, on the plane back to Rome after visiting Mongolia.When asked by the press about his future travel plans, the Pope brought up his physical abilities and how their limitation may impact the rest of his time in office. ""To tell the truth, for me going on a journey now is not as easy as it was in the beginning. There are difficulties with walking and that limits me,"" he said. The Argentinian pope has been suffering from knee pain since May 2022, forcing him to use a wheelchair. The man who has ventured across the globe, even visiting ""peripheral"" countries, half-heartedly admitted on Monday that he would be traveling very little at best.Referring to his upcoming visit to Marseille for the Mediterranean Days on September 22 and 23, Francis hinted that he might also visit ""a small European country."" Rumors of a trip to Kosovo have been circulating in the Vatican for several months. But even this remains highly uncertain, as the Pope, who will turn 87 in December, seems quite tired. ""We are seeing if we can do it,"" he explained.There was no mention of trips, despite recently mentioning them himself, to India, Argentina, Indonesia or East Timor. He hinted that the few days spent in Mongolia with the local Catholic community and its dynamic bishop, Cardinal Giorgio Marengo, would be his last in a distant country, if not his final trip abroad.When asked about a visit to Vietnam, the Pope joked, ""If I don't go, surely John XXIV will go,"" referring to his possible successor. For several months now, the health of Pope Francis, who has been hospitalized twice, has raised questions. This admission, which gives the impression that the Pope is aware of his physical limitations, could reignite speculation about a potential resignation.During his trip to Mongolia, where Chinese followers were present at every stop, Pope Francis also addressed the issue of Catholics in China, who are under strict control by the regime. The previous day he called on them to be ""good citizens."" When asked about this statement, the Pope expressed that it was necessary to make China understand that Catholics were not engaged in a political endeavor, but solely a religious one. He explained, ""I think we need to move forward in the religious aspect to understand each other better and so that Chinese citizens do not think that the Church does not accept their culture and values and that the Church is dependent on another, foreign power.""",Religions,recognizing impacts aging physical constraints imposes particularly challenging especially head state religious leader thats exactly pope francis monday september plane back rome visiting mongolia asked press future travel plans pope brought physical abilities limitation may impact rest time office tell truth going journey easy beginning difficulties walking limits said argentinian pope suffering knee pain since may forcing use wheelchair man ventured across globe even visiting peripheral countries half heartedly admitted monday would traveling little best referring upcoming visit marseille mediterranean days september francis hinted might also visit small european country rumors trip kosovo circulating vatican several months even remains highly uncertain pope turn december seems quite tired seeing explained mention trips despite recently mentioning india argentina indonesia east timor hinted days spent mongolia local catholic community dynamic bishop cardinal giorgio marengo would last distant country final trip abroad asked visit vietnam pope joked dont surely john xxiv referring possible successor several months health pope francis hospitalized twice raised questions admission gives impression pope aware physical limitations could reignite speculation potential resignation trip mongolia chinese followers present every stop pope francis also addressed issue catholics china strict control regime previous day called good citizens asked statement pope expressed necessary make china understand catholics engaged political endeavor solely religious one explained think need move forward religious aspect understand better chinese citizens think church accept culture values church dependent another foreign power,recogn impact age physic constraint impos particularli challeng especi head state religi leader that exactli pope franci monday septemb plane back rome visit mongolia ask press futur travel plan pope brought physic abil limit may impact rest time offic tell truth go journey easi begin difficulti walk limit said argentinian pope suffer knee pain sinc may forc use wheelchair man ventur across globe even visit peripher countri half heartedli admit monday would travel littl best refer upcom visit marseil mediterranean day septemb franci hint might also visit small european countri rumor trip kosovo circul vatican sever month even remain highli uncertain pope turn decemb seem quit tire see explain mention trip despit recent mention india argentina indonesia east timor hint day spent mongolia local cathol commun dynam bishop cardin giorgio marengo would last distant countri final trip abroad ask visit vietnam pope joke dont sure john xxiv refer possibl successor sever month health pope franci hospit twice rais question admiss give impress pope awar physic limit could reignit specul potenti resign trip mongolia chines follow present everi stop pope franci also address issu cathol china strict control regim previou day call good citizen ask statement pope express necessari make china understand cathol engag polit endeavor sole religi one explain think need move forward religi aspect understand better chines citizen think church accept cultur valu church depend anoth foreign power
In defense of the delicate balance of French secularism,The government's ban on abayas and khamis cannot be summed up as a simple diversionary tactic to mask problems in the education system. Secularism deserves to be defended as a guarantee of concrete freedoms for all.,"A simple item of clothing or a symbol of Islamism? Protecting religious freedom or being able to live alongside one another? Political instrumentalization or a core societal issue? These questions are still shaking up French society, ever since three pupils were expelled from a secondary school in Creil, a northern Paris suburb, 34 years ago for wearing the Islamic headscarf. Now the issue is once again at the heart of public debate, after the French Minister of Education Gabriel Attal announced a ban on the abaya, the long body-covering dress worn by some Muslim women, on August 27. The memo he has sent to school principals states that wearing it falls within the scope of a 2004 law banning ""the wearing of symbols or outfits through which pupils ostensibly show a religious affiliation"" in public schools.In 2003, the Stasi Commission, set up by then-president Jacques Chirac to examine the issue, decided to call for legislation for two main reasons: the testimonies of young Muslim women calling for a law to protect them against religious pressure and the use of the Islamic headscarf as an instrument of geopolitical influence.Two decades later, these two ideas have only been confirmed: There have been attempts by religious figures to impose religious rules in certain neighborhoods alongside intensive use of social media. After the terrible series of terrorist attacks in 2012-2016, the assassination of teacher Samuel Paty in 2020 was a tragic reminder of how central the education system is to Islamists' strategies. As these events unfolded, the issue of secularism became an increasingly divisive political tool.Today, however, the abaya ban cannot be summed up as a simple diversionary tactic by the government to mask the difficulties facing the school system. Many people in the education sector have called for a clear, national standard, justified by an upsurge in ""attacks on secularism."" The measure is certainly a way for the minister to make his mark in his new role − but it is also a way for him to assume his responsibilities.Opponents of the ban have referred the issue to the Conseil d'Etat, the country's highest administrative court, which will judge whether it complies with the 2004 law. The 2004 law on secularism was originally written to cover ""ostensibly"" religious garments, but also to respect the principle of the European Convention on Human Rights, which says that freedom of religion can only be restricted for reasons linked to the ""protection of public order (...) or of the rights and freedoms of others"".The need to preserve this fragile balance and to protect both pupils and teachers from religious pressures and quarrels should guide political leaders, particularly those on the left, for whom secularism has long been a central marker. Isn't there a contradiction between some people's denial of the religious character of the abaya − even though many Muslims see it as such − and these same people's accusation that the ban is Islamophobic? The concept of secularism deserves to be more widely taught as a historical achievement rather than an abstract theory. It also deserves to be defended, certainly not as a means of discrimination, but as a guarantee of concrete freedoms for all, in particular the right of women and men to choose and live their identity independently.",Religions,simple item clothing symbol islamism protecting religious freedom able live alongside one another political instrumentalization core societal issue questions still shaking french society ever since three pupils expelled secondary school creil northern paris suburb years ago wearing islamic headscarf issue heart public debate french minister education gabriel attal announced ban abaya long body covering dress worn muslim women august memo sent school principals states wearing falls within scope law banning wearing symbols outfits pupils ostensibly show religious affiliation public schools stasi commission set president jacques chirac examine issue decided call legislation two main reasons testimonies young muslim women calling law protect religious pressure use islamic headscarf instrument geopolitical influence two decades later two ideas confirmed attempts religious figures impose religious rules certain neighborhoods alongside intensive use social media terrible series terrorist attacks assassination teacher samuel paty tragic reminder central education system islamists strategies events unfolded issue secularism became increasingly divisive political tool today however abaya ban summed simple diversionary tactic government mask difficulties facing school system many people education sector called clear national standard justified upsurge attacks secularism measure certainly way minister make mark new role also way assume responsibilities opponents ban referred issue conseil detat countrys highest administrative court judge whether complies law law secularism originally written cover ostensibly religious garments also respect principle european convention human rights says freedom religion restricted reasons linked protection public order rights freedoms others need preserve fragile balance protect pupils teachers religious pressures quarrels guide political leaders particularly left secularism long central marker isnt contradiction peoples denial religious character abaya even though many muslims see peoples accusation ban islamophobic concept secularism deserves widely taught historical achievement rather abstract theory also deserves defended certainly means discrimination guarantee concrete freedoms particular right women men choose live identity independently,simpl item cloth symbol islam protect religi freedom abl live alongsid one anoth polit instrument core societ issu question still shake french societi ever sinc three pupil expel secondari school creil northern pari suburb year ago wear islam headscarf issu heart public debat french minist educ gabriel attal announc ban abaya long bodi cover dress worn muslim women august memo sent school princip state wear fall within scope law ban wear symbol outfit pupil ostens show religi affili public school stasi commiss set presid jacqu chirac examin issu decid call legisl two main reason testimoni young muslim women call law protect religi pressur use islam headscarf instrument geopolit influenc two decad later two idea confirm attempt religi figur impos religi rule certain neighborhood alongsid intens use social media terribl seri terrorist attack assassin teacher samuel pati tragic remind central educ system islamist strategi event unfold issu secular becam increasingli divis polit tool today howev abaya ban sum simpl diversionari tactic govern mask difficulti face school system mani peopl educ sector call clear nation standard justifi upsurg attack secular measur certainli way minist make mark new role also way assum respons oppon ban refer issu conseil detat countri highest administr court judg whether compli law law secular origin written cover ostens religi garment also respect principl european convent human right say freedom religion restrict reason link protect public order right freedom other need preserv fragil balanc protect pupil teacher religi pressur quarrel guid polit leader particularli left secular long central marker isnt contradict peopl denial religi charact abaya even though mani muslim see peopl accus ban islamophob concept secular deserv wide taught histor achiev rather abstract theori also deserv defend certainli mean discrimin guarante concret freedom particular right women men choos live ident independ
"Muslim rights group appeals France's abaya ban in schools, bringing debate to highest court",    An organization filed an appeal after the government banned the wearing of abayas and khamis in public schools. The country's highest administrative court held the hearing on Tuesday. ,"The debate over the wearing of abayas in France's schools took a two-hour detour to the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest administrative court, in Paris on Tuesday, September 5. Two hours passed with tense, passionate, and sometimes messy discussions before the court. An appeal was filed by the lawyers William Bourdon and Vincent Brengarth acting on behalf of the Action Droits des Musulmans (Action Rights of Muslims, ADM) organization, formed in 2015 to fight against measures deemed Islamophobic. It called for the suspension of the Ministry of Education's memorandum banning the wearing of abayas and khamis in schools.A total of five Ministry of Education representatives were present for the defense. However, only Guillaume Odinet, director of legal affairs, spoke on behalf of the government. Aside from Sihem Zine, the founder of ADM, and a judge, who did not speak but assisted the summary proceedings hearing president, this judicial debate on clothing worn by young Muslim women was only attended by men.Two things must be demonstrated for an appeal to be accepted: The urgency to act due to prejudice and a serious and manifestly illegal infringement of fundamental rights. Both parties vigorously debated these points under the watchful eye of Pierre Collin, who often attempted to put the discussions back on track. The Jeunesse France Harcèlement, an organization dedicated to fighting harassment and cyberbullying, which had sought to join the appeal prior to the debates, had their submission ruled inadmissible due to a lack of legal interest.In his argument, Brengarth focused on the fact that the government had made a major policy change by banning the abaya entirely from schools the day before the start of the new school year. It was a change from the last school year when the ban was left to the discretion of the heads of each school. There's therefore an urgent need to rule on the matter in order to avoid the exclusion of dozens, if not hundreds, of students. During his response to the defense brief, the lawyer cited several cases of young girls who were banned from class on the first day of the school year, as reported by the ADM association on Monday evening.As far as the Ministry of Education is concerned, the August 31 memorandum, accompanied by a letter explaining its content and approach to parents, is nothing more than a revision to a 2004 law prohibiting ostentatious religious symbols in schools, including symbols such as the hijab, yarmulke and disproportionately sized crosses. The defense believes that there is no new issue to debate and that the memorandum simply clarifies the application of existing law in response to a request from the heads of schools. As a result of the phenomenal rise of the wearing of the abaya as a Muslim and community marker in schools, Odinet said his ministry's monthly survey indicates an explosion of violations of secularism. The national education lawyer cites a previous decree by the Conseil d'État prohibiting the wearing of permanent bandanas in place of headscarves as support for his argument.",Religions,debate wearing abayas frances schools took two hour detour conseil detat frances highest administrative court paris tuesday september two hours passed tense passionate sometimes messy discussions court appeal filed lawyers william bourdon vincent brengarth acting behalf action droits des musulmans action rights muslims adm organization formed fight measures deemed islamophobic called suspension ministry educations memorandum banning wearing abayas khamis schools total five ministry education representatives present defense however guillaume odinet director legal affairs spoke behalf government aside sihem zine founder adm judge speak assisted summary proceedings hearing president judicial debate clothing worn young muslim women attended men two things must demonstrated appeal accepted urgency act due prejudice serious manifestly illegal infringement fundamental rights parties vigorously debated points watchful eye pierre collin often attempted put discussions back track jeunesse france harc lement organization dedicated fighting harassment cyberbullying sought join appeal prior debates submission ruled inadmissible due lack legal interest argument brengarth focused fact government made major policy change banning abaya entirely schools day start new school year change last school year ban left discretion heads school theres therefore urgent need rule matter order avoid exclusion dozens hundreds students response defense brief lawyer cited several cases young girls banned class first day school year reported adm association monday evening far ministry education concerned august memorandum accompanied letter explaining content approach parents nothing revision law prohibiting ostentatious religious symbols schools including symbols hijab yarmulke disproportionately sized crosses defense believes new issue debate memorandum simply clarifies application existing law response request heads schools result phenomenal rise wearing abaya muslim community marker schools odinet said ministrys monthly survey indicates explosion violations secularism national education lawyer cites previous decree conseil tat prohibiting wearing permanent bandanas place headscarves support argument,debat wear abaya franc school took two hour detour conseil detat franc highest administr court pari tuesday septemb two hour pass tens passion sometim messi discuss court appeal file lawyer william bourdon vincent brengarth act behalf action droit de musulman action right muslim adm organ form fight measur deem islamophob call suspens ministri educ memorandum ban wear abaya khami school total five ministri educ repres present defens howev guillaum odinet director legal affair spoke behalf govern asid sihem zine founder adm judg speak assist summari proceed hear presid judici debat cloth worn young muslim women attend men two thing must demonstr appeal accept urgenc act due prejudic seriou manifestli illeg infring fundament right parti vigor debat point watch eye pierr collin often attempt put discuss back track jeuness franc harc lement organ dedic fight harass cyberbulli sought join appeal prior debat submiss rule inadmiss due lack legal interest argument brengarth focus fact govern made major polici chang ban abaya entir school day start new school year chang last school year ban left discret head school there therefor urgent need rule matter order avoid exclus dozen hundr student respons defens brief lawyer cite sever case young girl ban class first day school year report adm associ monday even far ministri educ concern august memorandum accompani letter explain content approach parent noth revis law prohibit ostentati religi symbol school includ symbol hijab yarmulk disproportion size cross defens believ new issu debat memorandum simpli clarifi applic exist law respons request head school result phenomen rise wear abaya muslim commun marker school odinet said ministri monthli survey indic explos violat secular nation educ lawyer cite previou decre conseil tat prohibit wear perman bandana place headscarv support argument
Wearing the abaya to school: Who in France opposes the ban?,"    Activists from the Muslim sphere are opposed to the garment's ban, denouncing it as discriminatory and arbitrary or claiming that every woman has the right to control her own body. ","Elias d'Imzalène met with us not far from his home, in a rather stuffy Versailles tearoom. The customers included well-off young patrons and a number of well-dressed old ladies. There was not an abaya in sight. With his long, untrimmed beard, d'Imzalène stood out. But, as a true Versaillais, he was wearing a blazer with gold buttons and had an elegant leather satchel. His sophisticated chignon and rimless glasses completed a look that was hard to categorize – like his ideas.Since the announcement of the ban on wearing the abaya in French schools, d'Imzalène, founder of the now dormant site Islam & Info, has been one of the most active and virulent voices on X (formerly Twitter) to mobilize people against a ban he considers Islamophobic. The 40-something, who describes himself as a ""community influencer and political Muslim,"" prefers the label ""Islamian"" to ""Islamist.""As far as the abaya is concerned, he's not for it per se, but he's vehemently against banning it. Not so much in the name of his religious values but because of each woman's right to control her own body. ""In Islam, there is no clergy; it's up to each woman to decide what to wear, including the veil,"" he noted. ""The abaya is a reflection of those who wear it and also the result of the influence of TikTok, fashion, the desire to be noticed..."" His criticism of the abaya ban is that it ""defines secularism, and ultimately Frenchness, as the antithesis of Islam, as if an enemy was needed to exist.""Since the Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) was dissolved by decree in the fall of 2020, d'Imzalène has been one of the community's most vocal voices on this issue, but he is far from alone. Political scientist Gilles Kepel calls them ""entrepreneurs of anger.""For d'Imzalène, the ban on the abaya in schools will not pass like the ban on the headscarf in 2004: ""The country itself has changed, it's mixed. We are this country, too. We saw it with the riots that followed the death of Nahel M. [a 17-year-old killed by a policeman during a traffic stop on June 27]. There is a segment of Muslim youth who no longer want to remain silent and bow their heads. This generation isn't asking for its rights, it's exercising them.""In France, it's hard to find any religious authority or community leader explicitly advocating the wearing of the abaya in schools. In the Muslim sphere, people are instead mobilizing against its ban, following the example of Feiza Ben Mohamed, French correspondent for the official Turkish agency Anadolu and a polemicist, who, on Sunday, September 3, posted on her X account: ""Happy back-to-school to all our little sisters who will be returning to class tomorrow, in the outfit of their choice.

French court upholds abaya ban in public schools,"    Last month, President Emmanuel Macron's government made headlines by announcing a ban on the traditional over-garments worn by some Muslim women in schools, citing violations of educational secularism rules. ","France's top administrative court on Thursday, September 7, upheld a government ban on traditional over-garments worn by some Muslim women in schools and rejected complaints it was discriminatory and could incite hatred. President Emmanuel Macron's government announced last month it was banning the abaya in schools as it broke the rules on secularism in education. Muslim headscarves have already been banned on the grounds that they constitute a display of religious affiliation.An association representing Muslims filed a motion with the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest court for complaints against state authorities, for an injunction against the ban on the abaya and the qamis, its equivalent dress for men. The association said the ban was discriminatory and could incite hatred against Muslims, as well as racial profiling.But after examining the motion – filed by the Action for the Rights of Muslims (ADM) – for two days, the Conseil d'Etat rejected the arguments. It said wearing the abaya ""follows the logic of religious affirmation,"" adding that the decision was based on French law which did not allow anyone to wear visible signs of any religious affiliation in schools.The ban by the government did not, it said, cause ""serious or obviously illegal harm to the respect for personal lives, freedom of religion, the right to education, the well-being of children or the principle of non-discrimination.""Ahead of the ruling, France's Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM), established to represent Muslims before the government, had warned that banning the abaya could create ""an elevated risk of discrimination"" and said it was considering putting its own complaint before the Conseil d'Etat.The absence of ""a clear definition of this garment creates vagueness and legal uncertainty,"" it said. ADM's lawyer, Vincent Brengarth, argued during the court hearing that the abaya should be considered a traditional garment, not a religious one. He also accused the government of seeking political advantage with the ban. ADM president Sihem Zine said the rule was ""sexist"" because it singles out girls and ""targets Arabs.""But the Education Ministry said the abaya made its wearers ""immediately recognizable as belonging to the Muslim religion"" and therefore ran counter to France's secular culture. French schools sent dozens of girls home for refusing to remove their abayas – a shoulder-to-toe over-garment – on the first day of the school year on Monday. Nearly 300 schoolgirls defied the ban, Education Minister Gabriel Attal said. Most agreed to change garments but 67 refused and were sent home, he said.In 2016 the Conseil d'Etat overturned a ban in a French Riviera resort against the burkini, saying it failed to see any threat to public order from the long bathing suit worn by some Muslim women. Around 10% of France's 67 million inhabitants are Muslim, according to official estimates. Most have origins in northern African countries Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which were French colonies until the second half of the 20th century.",Religions,frances top administrative court thursday september upheld government ban traditional garments worn muslim women schools rejected complaints discriminatory could incite hatred president emmanuel macrons government announced last month banning abaya schools broke rules secularism education muslim headscarves already banned grounds constitute display religious affiliation association representing muslims filed motion conseil detat frances highest court complaints state authorities injunction ban abaya qamis equivalent dress men association said ban discriminatory could incite hatred muslims well racial profiling examining motion filed action rights muslims adm two days conseil detat rejected arguments said wearing abaya follows logic religious affirmation adding decision based french law allow anyone wear visible signs religious affiliation schools ban government said cause serious obviously illegal harm respect personal lives freedom religion right education well children principle non discrimination ahead ruling frances council muslim faith cfcm established represent muslims government warned banning abaya could create elevated risk discrimination said considering putting complaint conseil detat absence clear definition garment creates vagueness legal uncertainty said adms lawyer vincent brengarth argued court hearing abaya considered traditional garment religious one also accused government seeking political advantage ban adm president sihem zine said rule sexist singles girls targets arabs education ministry said abaya made wearers immediately recognizable belonging muslim religion therefore ran counter frances secular culture french schools sent dozens girls home refusing remove abayas shoulder toe garment first day school year monday nearly schoolgirls defied ban education minister gabriel attal said agreed change garments refused sent home said conseil detat overturned ban french riviera resort burkini saying failed see threat public order long bathing suit worn muslim women around frances million inhabitants muslim according official estimates origins northern african countries algeria morocco tunisia french colonies second half century,franc top administr court thursday septemb upheld govern ban tradit garment worn muslim women school reject complaint discriminatori could incit hatr presid emmanuel macron govern announc last month ban abaya school broke rule secular educ muslim headscarv alreadi ban ground constitut display religi affili associ repres muslim file motion conseil detat franc highest court complaint state author injunct ban abaya qami equival dress men associ said ban discriminatori could incit hatr muslim well racial profil examin motion file action right muslim adm two day conseil detat reject argument said wear abaya follow logic religi affirm ad decis base french law allow anyon wear visibl sign religi affili school ban govern said caus seriou obvious illeg harm respect person live freedom religion right educ well children principl non discrimin ahead rule franc council muslim faith cfcm establish repres muslim govern warn ban abaya could creat elev risk discrimin said consid put complaint conseil detat absenc clear definit garment creat vagu legal uncertainti said adm lawyer vincent brengarth argu court hear abaya consid tradit garment religi one also accus govern seek polit advantag ban adm presid sihem zine said rule sexist singl girl target arab educ ministri said abaya made wearer immedi recogniz belong muslim religion therefor ran counter franc secular cultur french school sent dozen girl home refus remov abaya shoulder toe garment first day school year monday nearli schoolgirl defi ban educ minist gabriel attal said agre chang garment refus sent home said conseil detat overturn ban french riviera resort burkini say fail see threat public order long bath suit worn muslim women around franc million inhabit muslim accord offici estim origin northern african countri algeria morocco tunisia french coloni second half centuri
Abaya ban in French schools: 'Wearing the abaya is a political gesture',"Iannis Roder, a history and geography teacher, agrees with French Education Minister Gabriel Attal's ban on abaya dresses in public schools. He says that the abaya is traditionally worn in order to conform to the religious norms set out by Islamists.","The law of March 15, 2004, prohibits pupils from wearing any conspicuous symbols or clothing that manifest a religious affiliation. It was in the application of this law that Education Minister Gabriel Attal said that ""abayas could no longer be worn at school."" While the appearance of this garment was noted back in 2010 in a few schools in the northern Paris suburb Seine-Saint-Denis, it's only recently that it has been widely worn.So as not to fall foul of the law, some students have argued that wearing the abaya has no religious significance but is simply a dress worn ""culturally and not religiously."" In Lille, Nice and Toulouse, girls are being schooled to use the same argument and language and are simply repeating Islamist rhetoric aimed at undermining the French Republic's education system, which represents a danger for political Islam, as it offers access to individual freedom through knowledge.Wearing the abaya is not religious? Online stores offering ""Islamic clothing"" or ""for Muslim women"" suggest otherwise. In fact, the abaya is commonly worn to comply with religious norms that require women to be ""modest"" and by extension, ""virtuous."" The concept belittles women, who are deemed inherently impure and are expected to conceal their forms – just as the hijab conceals their hair – from the gaze of men, at the risk of arousing their contempt, anger and even violence.The situation of women in Iran and Afghanistan is a daily reminder of this: Not only how the control of women's bodies and dress policing are established, but also how Islamism is gradually sliding Islam toward rigid norms, leading some French young people to believe that certain practices are Muslim when in fact, they are Islamist.Wearing the abaya is part of this logic, as it is a political gesture more consistent with wearing a uniform than simply a fashion statement: the dress differentiates women and gives them recognition, but at the same time they are submitting to rules of conduct whose philosophy is foreign to that of the Republic's education system. It symbolizes belonging to a community, and if it is difficult for some to remove it, it is because they would be breaking the rules, which are sometimes understood as absolute. Moreover, could an ordinary garment give rise to the outburst that followed the announcement of its ban on social media?The political dimension is also brought home to France by the appearance of Abdelhakim Sefrioui in 2011 – a disquieting figure at the heart of what led to the murder of Samuel Paty – who, during the first incidents linked to the wearing of abayas in a high school in Saint-Ouen, in the northern suburbs of Paris, posed as the uncle of one of the students in order to put pressure on the principal. At the time, the girls said they wore the garment voluntarily, and many of them today tirelessly repeat: ""It's my choice.""",Religions,law march prohibits pupils wearing cons symbols clothing manifest religious affiliation application law education minister gabriel attal said abayas could longer worn school appearance garment noted back schools northern paris suburb seine saint denis recently widely worn fall foul law students argued wearing abaya religious significance simply dress worn culturally religiously lille nice toulouse girls schooled use argument language simply repeating islamist rhetoric aimed undermining french republics education system represents danger political islam offers access individual freedom knowledge wearing abaya religious online stores offering islamic clothing muslim women suggest otherwise fact abaya commonly worn comply religious norms require women modest extension virtuous concept belittles women deemed inherently impure expected conceal forms hijab conceals hair gaze men risk arousing contempt anger even violence situation women iran afghanistan daily reminder control womens bodies dress policing established also islamism gradually sliding islam toward rigid norms leading french young people believe certain practices muslim fact islamist wearing abaya part logic political gesture consistent wearing uniform simply fashion statement dress differentiates women gives recognition time submitting rules conduct whose philosophy foreign republics education system symbolizes belonging community difficult remove would breaking rules sometimes understood absolute moreover could ordinary garment give rise outburst followed announcement ban social media political dimension also brought home france appearance abdelhakim sefrioui disquieting figure heart led murder samuel paty first incidents linked wearing abayas high school saint ouen northern suburbs paris posed uncle one students order put pressure principal time girls said wore garment voluntarily many today tirelessly repeat choice,law march prohibit pupil wear con symbol cloth manifest religi affili applic law educ minist gabriel attal said abaya could longer worn school appear garment note back school northern pari suburb sein saint deni recent wide worn fall foul law student argu wear abaya religi signific simpli dress worn cultur religi lill nice toulous girl school use argument languag simpli repeat islamist rhetor aim undermin french republ educ system repres danger polit islam offer access individu freedom knowledg wear abaya religi onlin store offer islam cloth muslim women suggest otherwis fact abaya commonli worn compli religi norm requir women modest extens virtuou concept belittl women deem inher impur expect conceal form hijab conceal hair gaze men risk arous contempt anger even violenc situat women iran afghanistan daili remind control women bodi dress polic establish also islam gradual slide islam toward rigid norm lead french young peopl believ certain practic muslim fact islamist wear abaya part logic polit gestur consist wear uniform simpli fashion statement dress differenti women give recognit time submit rule conduct whose philosophi foreign republ educ system symbol belong commun difficult remov would break rule sometim understood absolut moreov could ordinari garment give rise outburst follow announc ban social media polit dimens also brought home franc appear abdelhakim sefrioui disquiet figur heart led murder samuel pati first incid link wear abaya high school saint ouen northern suburb pari pose uncl one student order put pressur princip time girl said wore garment voluntarili mani today tirelessli repeat choic
Abaya ban in French schools: Top court gives government legal boost,"    On Thursday, the Conseil d'Etat rejected the appeal lodged by a Muslim rights organization. Other appeals are underway. ","This is only the first decision in what promises to be a legal trench war, and it is in favor of the French government, particularly Education Minister Gabriel Attal. The Conseil d'Etat, France's top administrative court, rejected the appeal lodged by the Action Droits des Musulmans (Action for the Rights of Muslims, ADM) association, calling for the suspension of the ban on abayas and khamis in schools, laid down in a memorandum dated August 31.In an emergency session, the administrative judge ruled that the ban on these garments in public schools did not violate fundamental freedoms and did not cause ""serious or obviously illegal harm to the respect for personal lives, freedom of religion, the right to education, the well-being of children or the principle of non-discrimination."" In the opinion of the judge, ""the abaya follows the logic of religious affirmation, as is clear from the comments made during discussions with students."" Its prohibition therefore falls within the scope of the 2004 law banning conspicuous religious symbols in schools.The ADM association's appeal was the subject of a two-hour hearing on Tuesday, September 5, before the Paris court. In his decision, the judge recalled the figures quoted at the hearing by the Education Ministry's director of legal affairs, Guillaume Odinet. There were 1,984 reports of breaches of secularism in schools for 2022-2023, the vast majority of which related to the wearing of abayas, compared with 617 during the previous school year.Similarly, the judge repeated the definition of the abaya given at the hearing by the ministry's representative: ""A woman's garment covering the whole body except for the face and hands."" He continued, ""The wearing of this type of clothing, which cannot be regarded as discreet, constitutes an overt demonstration of the religious affiliation of the students in question."" He went on to point out that this is prohibited by the government's instructions on how to apply the 2004 law banning Islamic head scarves and other religious symbols from public schools.""The court has not addressed our arguments and is simply repeating those of the Ministry [of Education], without demonstrating the religious nature or addressing the absence of a definition [of what an abaya is],"" said Vincent Brengarth, the lawyer for Action Droits des Musulmans, on Thursday. Conversely, Minister Attal hailed on X (formerly Twitter) ""an important ruling for the republic's schools,"" which must ""welcome all students, with the same rights and the same duties, without discrimination or stigmatization.""",Religions,first decision promises legal trench war favor french government particularly education minister gabriel attal conseil detat frances top administrative court rejected appeal lodged action droits des musulmans action rights muslims adm association calling suspension ban abayas khamis schools laid memorandum dated august emergency session administrative judge ruled ban garments public schools violate fundamental freedoms cause serious obviously illegal harm respect personal lives freedom religion right education well children principle non discrimination opinion judge abaya follows logic religious affirmation clear comments made discussions students prohibition therefore falls within scope law banning cons religious symbols schools adm associations appeal subject two hour hearing tuesday september paris court decision judge recalled figures quoted hearing education ministrys director legal affairs guillaume odinet reports breaches secularism schools vast majority related wearing abayas compared previous school year similarly judge repeated definition abaya given hearing ministrys representative womans garment covering whole body except face hands continued wearing type clothing regarded discreet constitutes overt demonstration religious affiliation students question went point prohibited governments instructions apply law banning islamic head scarves religious symbols public schools court addressed arguments simply repeating ministry education without demonstrating religious nature addressing absence definition abaya said vincent brengarth lawyer action droits des musulmans thursday conversely minister attal hailed formerly twitter important ruling republics schools must welcome students rights duties without discrimination stigmatization,first decis promis legal trench war favor french govern particularli educ minist gabriel attal conseil detat franc top administr court reject appeal lodg action droit de musulman action right muslim adm associ call suspens ban abaya khami school laid memorandum date august emerg session administr judg rule ban garment public school violat fundament freedom caus seriou obvious illeg harm respect person live freedom religion right educ well children principl non discrimin opinion judg abaya follow logic religi affirm clear comment made discuss student prohibit therefor fall within scope law ban con religi symbol school adm associ appeal subject two hour hear tuesday septemb pari court decis judg recal figur quot hear educ ministri director legal affair guillaum odinet report breach secular school vast major relat wear abaya compar previou school year similarli judg repeat definit abaya given hear ministri repres woman garment cover whole bodi except face hand continu wear type cloth regard discreet constitut overt demonstr religi affili student question went point prohibit govern instruct appli law ban islam head scarv religi symbol public school court address argument simpli repeat ministri educ without demonstr religi natur address absenc definit abaya said vincent brengarth lawyer action droit de musulman thursday convers minist attal hail formerli twitter import rule republ school must welcom student right duti without discrimin stigmat
French secularism: Education minister to ban abayas in public schools,    Reports of breaches of secularism have increased over the past year in France. The new Minister of Education intends to clarify a situation that his predecessor had left partly up to the discretion of school heads. ,"Gabriel Attal has made up his mind. France's minister of education has ""decided it will no longer be possible to wear an abaya at school,"" he announced on the TF1 evening news, on Sunday, August 27. This was a ""necessary and fair rule,"" he said, adding: ""When you enter a classroom, you must not be able to identify the religion of pupils by looking at them."" Attal had already issued a firm instruction to the regional heads of education he met with on Thursday: ""Wherever the Republic is tested, we must stand together,"" he told them.For almost a year, principals and school directors confronted with pupils wearing abayas (long Middle Eastern dresses worn over other garments) or qamis (long tunics for men) have been asking for ""clear instructions"" as to whether or not such garments ostensibly manifest a religious affiliation, contrary to the March 2004 law banning religious symbols in schools. In a confidential memo, France's Council of Advisors for Secularism and the Values of the Republic advocated taking a firm stand as early as June 2022, ""anxious not to once again leave management staff to their own devices,"" said Alain Seksig, the body's general secretary.But former education minister Pap Ndiaye did not want to make a decision. In November 2022, he issued a circular to ""guide"" school princiapls and to explain the steps to be taken to help them to make up their own minds. This was an issue that is also being debated within the Muslim community itself. The French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) asserted in June that the abaya ""is not a Muslim religious symbol"" and that ""in the Muslim tradition (...), a garment of any kind is not a religious symbol in itself.""The margin of interpretation Ndiaye left to school principals may have led some to prohibit such clothing and others to authorize it. ""We don't want to be the arbiters of uncertainty. This could potentially put us in danger, as we stand at the gates of our establishments every morning,"" emphasized Didier Georges, school principal and national secretary of the SNPDEN-UNSA teachers' union.Over the past year, reports of breaches of secularism have only increased. They are up 120% between the 2022-2023 school year and the previous one (4,710 vs. 2,167), according to a memo from the state services, a copy of which was obtained by Le Monde. Between April and June, the number of protests amounted to 1,892. This is an unprecedented figure since the introduction of this count in 2018, to be considered against the 12 million pupils in France last year.",Religions,gabriel attal made mind frances minister education decided longer possible wear abaya school announced evening news sunday august necessary fair rule said adding enter classroom must able identify religion pupils looking attal already issued firm instruction regional heads education met thursday wherever republic tested must stand together told almost year principals school directors confronted pupils wearing abayas long middle eastern dresses worn garments qamis long tunics men asking clear instructions whether garments ostensibly manifest religious affiliation contrary march law banning religious symbols schools confidential memo frances council advisors secularism values republic advocated taking firm stand early june anxious leave management staff devices said alain seksig bodys general secretary former education minister pap ndiaye want make decision november issued circular guide school princiapls explain steps taken help make minds issue also debated within muslim community french council muslim faith cfcm asserted june abaya muslim religious symbol muslim tradition garment kind religious symbol margin interpretation ndiaye left school principals may led prohibit clothing others authorize dont want arbiters uncertainty could potentially put danger stand gates establishments every morning emphasized didier georges school principal national secretary snpden unsa teachers union past year reports breaches secularism increased school year previous one according memo state services copy obtained monde april june number protests amounted unprecedented figure since introduction count considered million pupils france last year,gabriel attal made mind franc minist educ decid longer possibl wear abaya school announc even news sunday august necessari fair rule said ad enter classroom must abl identifi religion pupil look attal alreadi issu firm instruct region head educ met thursday wherev republ test must stand togeth told almost year princip school director confront pupil wear abaya long middl eastern dress worn garment qami long tunic men ask clear instruct whether garment ostens manifest religi affili contrari march law ban religi symbol school confidenti memo franc council advisor secular valu republ advoc take firm stand earli june anxiou leav manag staff devic said alain seksig bodi gener secretari former educ minist pap ndiay want make decis novemb issu circular guid school princiapl explain step taken help make mind issu also debat within muslim commun french council muslim faith cfcm assert june abaya muslim religi symbol muslim tradit garment kind religi symbol margin interpret ndiay left school princip may led prohibit cloth other author dont want arbit uncertainti could potenti put danger stand gate establish everi morn emphas didier georg school princip nation secretari snpden unsa teacher union past year report breach secular increas school year previou one accord memo state servic copi obtain mond april june number protest amount unpreced figur sinc introduct count consid million pupil franc last year
Abaya ban in French schools: 'The government does not understand the boomerang effect of coercive laws',The sociologist Agnès De Féo warns that banning the abaya dress from schools could prove counterproductive.,"The return to school this year has seen yet another controversy concerning Muslim dress for women. The abaya is set to become a national cause since Gabriel Attal's declaration on August 27 that ""the abaya can no longer be worn to school,"" which echoes Nicolas Sarkozy, who fourteen years ago, on June 22, 2009, said: “The burqa is not welcome on the French Republic's territory."" It led to the law passed on October 11, 2010, that prohibited concealing the face in the public space. In both statements, it's not the women who are the subject of the sentence, but the clothing they wear, such as the abaya or burqa – exogenous objects that threaten the nation’s integrity.Such a caricatured portrayal might give rise to a smile if it weren't so popular with a large proportion of the French population and exploited by political figures, which as they do so, reveals their obsession, since the days of colonialism, with Muslim women's bodies. In the end, there is little mention of the women themselves. They are still the great unknowns in the speculation about them. Yet to suspect these girls of maneuvering against the school is to overestimate an adolescent minority phenomenon that remains harmless.There's no denying that the abaya is a religious garment, even if those concerned refute it. By ingenuously asserting that the abaya is not a religious garment, but a traditional item of clothing worn by choice as a fashionable statement, the teenagers concerned play on its polymorphism. While the elegant dresses worn in Gulf countries in particular may indeed be called ""abayas,"" the term has a completely different meaning in France. With its pared-down design – no form-hugging cut – its unembroidered plain colors, and frequently elasticated cuffs, the abaya fits the image of a pious Muslim woman.The women I have met in the course of my sociological research wear the abaya with a long veil, identifiable as Islamic in the way it is attached to the head, leaving no doubt as to the expression of their faith. This is also the case with schoolgirls wearing the abaya, who cover their hair as soon as they leave school. There is no question that the garment expresses religiosity, as it is purchased in specialized stores and websites aimed at a practicing Muslim clientele, rather than in mainstream ready-to-wear stores. Although when taken out of context it is perceived as a simple dress, the abaya is worn in France for its Islamic significance. Those who wear it to school should therefore logically fall under the ban imposed by the 2004 law.",Religions,return school year seen yet another controversy concerning muslim dress women abaya set become national cause since gabriel attals declaration august abaya longer worn school echoes nicolas sarkozy fourteen years ago june said burqa welcome french republics territory led law passed october prohibited concealing face public space statements women subject sentence clothing wear abaya burqa exogenous objects threaten nation integrity caricatured portrayal might give rise smile werent popular large proportion french population exploited political figures reveals obsession since days colonialism muslim womens bodies end little mention women still great unknowns speculation yet suspect girls maneuvering school overestimate adolescent minority phenomenon remains harmless theres denying abaya religious garment even concerned refute ingenuously asserting abaya religious garment traditional item clothing worn choice fashionable statement teenagers concerned play polymorphism elegant dresses worn gulf countries particular may indeed called abayas term completely different meaning france pared design form hugging cut unembroidered plain colors frequently elasticated cuffs abaya fits image pious muslim woman women met course sociological research wear abaya long veil identifiable islamic way attached head leaving doubt expression faith also case schoolgirls wearing abaya cover hair soon leave school question garment expresses religiosity purchased specialized stores websites aimed practicing muslim clientele rather mainstream ready wear stores although taken context perceived simple dress abaya worn france islamic significance wear school therefore logically fall ban imposed law,return school year seen yet anoth controversi concern muslim dress women abaya set becom nation caus sinc gabriel attal declar august abaya longer worn school echo nicola sarkozi fourteen year ago june said burqa welcom french republ territori led law pass octob prohibit conceal face public space statement women subject sentenc cloth wear abaya burqa exogen object threaten nation integr caricatur portray might give rise smile werent popular larg proport french popul exploit polit figur reveal obsess sinc day coloni muslim women bodi end littl mention women still great unknown specul yet suspect girl maneuv school overestim adolesc minor phenomenon remain harmless there deni abaya religi garment even concern refut ingenu assert abaya religi garment tradit item cloth worn choic fashion statement teenag concern play polymorph eleg dress worn gulf countri particular may inde call abaya term complet differ mean franc pare design form hug cut unembroid plain color frequent elast cuff abaya fit imag piou muslim woman women met cours sociolog research wear abaya long veil identifi islam way attach head leav doubt express faith also case schoolgirl wear abaya cover hair soon leav school question garment express religios purchas special store websit aim practic muslim clientel rather mainstream readi wear store although taken context perceiv simpl dress abaya worn franc islam signific wear school therefor logic fall ban impos law
"""In evoking 'great mother Russia,' Pope Francis spoke the language in which his Russian audience is steeped""",Historian Laura Pettinaroli argues that Pope Francis's recent comments shouldn't be understood as an endorsement of Moscow's nationalist project but as an attempt to make himself heard by Russian Catholics.,"The words spoken by Pope Francis via videoconference to a gathering of young Russian Catholics in St. Petersburg on August 25 sparked a heated debate: ""Never forget your inheritance. You are the heirs of the great Russia. The great Russia of the saints, of the kings, of the great Russia of Peter the Great, of Catherine II, that great imperial Russia, cultivated, with so much culture and humanity. Never forget this inheritance. You are the heirs of the great Mother Russia, go forward. And thank you. Thank you for your way of being, for your way of being Russian."" Spoken in Italian, this comment concluded a question-and-answer session and a speech in which Francis invited his listeners to ""be artisans of peace"" and ""seeds of reconciliation.""Unsurprisingly, the choice of referring to ""great mother Russia"" and the imperial past provoked enthusiasm in Russia and exasperation in Ukraine. The Vatican press room then attempted to defuse the controversy: The pope's words were to be seen as a simple encouragement ""to preserve and promote what is positive in Russia's great cultural and spiritual heritage, and certainly not to exalt imperialistic logics and governmental personalities, cited to indicate certain historical periods of reference.""These words, however, have raised questions regarding the Vatican's position on the war. The Vatican's efforts to maintain symbolic and diplomatic ties with Russia have regularly met with incomprehension. The Holy See's communiqué from August 30, 2022, naming Russia as the initiator of a conflict that is ""morally unjust, unacceptable, barbaric, senseless, repugnant and sacrilegious,"" has not dispelled accusations of duplicity.How can we understand the meaning of this speech: a blunder or diplomatic strategy? Rereading the past of this country marked by Orthodoxy, Francis focused on its political history, citing Peter the Great (tsar from 1682-1725) and Catherine II (1762-1796). It's easy to see why Ukrainians were so upset. Peter and Catherine were tsars of imperial conquest, and Catherine pursued an intense colonization policy in Crimea.No doubt the pope had other perspectives in mind when he evoked these two sovereigns, such as their European stature with the founding of St. Petersburg, a gateway to the Baltic, and Catherine's association with the philosophers of the Enlightenment. These two reigns also saw the development of the local Catholic Church. The oukase (decree) of 1705 guaranteed freedom of worship to Catholic foreigners. And it was under Catherine II that several churches were opened (including St. Catherine's, where the videoconference was held) and diocesan structures were established.",Religions,words spoken pope francis via videoconference gathering young russian catholics petersburg august sparked heated debate never forget inheritance heirs great russia great russia saints kings great russia peter great catherine great imperial russia cultivated much culture humanity never forget inheritance heirs great mother russia forward thank thank way way russian spoken italian comment concluded question answer session speech francis invited listeners artisans peace seeds reconciliation unsurprisingly choice referring great mother russia imperial past provoked enthusiasm russia exasperation ukraine vatican press room attempted defuse controversy popes words seen simple encouragement preserve promote positive russias great cultural spiritual heritage certainly exalt imperialistic logics governmental personalities cited indicate certain historical periods reference words however raised questions regarding vaticans position war vaticans efforts maintain symbolic diplomatic ties russia regularly met incomprehension holy sees communiqu august naming russia initiator conflict morally unjust unacceptable barbaric senseless repugnant sacrilegious dispelled accusations duplicity understand meaning speech blunder diplomatic strategy rereading past country marked orthodoxy francis focused political history citing peter great tsar catherine easy see ukrainians upset peter catherine tsars imperial conquest catherine pursued intense colonization policy crimea doubt pope perspectives mind evoked two sovereigns european stature founding petersburg gateway baltic catherines association philosophers enlightenment two reigns also saw development local catholic church oukase decree guaranteed freedom worship catholic foreigners catherine several churches opened including catherines videoconference held diocesan structures established,word spoken pope franci via videoconfer gather young russian cathol petersburg august spark heat debat never forget inherit heir great russia great russia saint king great russia peter great catherin great imperi russia cultiv much cultur human never forget inherit heir great mother russia forward thank thank way way russian spoken italian comment conclud question answer session speech franci invit listen artisan peac seed reconcili unsurprisingli choic refer great mother russia imperi past provok enthusiasm russia exasper ukrain vatican press room attempt defus controversi pope word seen simpl encourag preserv promot posit russia great cultur spiritu heritag certainli exalt imperialist logic government person cite indic certain histor period refer word howev rais question regard vatican posit war vatican effort maintain symbol diplomat tie russia regularli met incomprehens holi see communiqu august name russia initi conflict moral unjust unaccept barbar senseless repugn sacrilegi dispel accus duplic understand mean speech blunder diplomat strategi reread past countri mark orthodoxi franci focus polit histori cite peter great tsar catherin easi see ukrainian upset peter catherin tsar imperi conquest catherin pursu intens colon polici crimea doubt pope perspect mind evok two sovereign european statur found petersburg gateway baltic catherin associ philosoph enlighten two reign also saw develop local cathol church oukas decre guarante freedom worship cathol foreign catherin sever church open includ catherin videoconfer held diocesan structur establish
Macron to attend Pope Francis's mass in Marseille,    The French president's attendance at the Catholic mass celebrated by the pope in Marseille next week has proved a controversial issue in this secular country. ,"French President Emmanuel Macron will attend a Catholic mass celebrated by Pope Francis in Marseille next week, the Elysée presidential office said on Thursday, September 14.The question of Macron's attendance at the September 23 service in the Mediterranean city's Velodrome stadium has been controversial in strictly secular France, where the government has in recent weeks been pushing to bar in schools the abaya garment worn by some Muslim women.The mass will be a ""popular event"" and ""festive"", said a presidential official, asking not to be named.

Gérard Miller: 'Never have so many French Jews lost their moral compass to such an extent',"The film director and psychoanalyst believes that two Jewish identities are now in opposition, as some Jews have allowed themselves to be seduced by the far right.","I belong to a generation of Jews, born after the war, for whom being on the political left was a matter of course, from adolescence onward.I belong to a generation that viscerally hated anything remotely related to the far right, and to whom Israel represented first and foremost the refuge that our parents and grandparents, victims of Nazism, had lacked, even though we made no secret of our sympathy for the Palestinians.I belong to a generation where being Jewish and French naturally meant loving Maximilien Robespierre and the 1789 revolution, Louise Michel and the Paris Commune, Emile Zola, Léon Blum, Missak Manouchian and Jean-Paul Sartre.I belong to a generation in which Jews, because of the suffering they had endured over the centuries, seemed to us more than ever to provide the face of tolerance, solidarity and culture, too.Of course, in those distant days, not all French Jews shared the same reference points and values. But, regardless of their convictions and beliefs, they all had at least three inviolable memories in common: the sham of the Alfred Dreyfus affair (in which a Jewish military captain was convicted of treason), the crimes of the collaborationist Philippe Pétain regime and the horror of the Holocaust. That was a lot and it meant it was possible to debate everything else together, with strong opposition but without tearing each other apart, even within the very conservative Representative Council of Jewish Institutions (CRIF).Today, alas, all that belongs to the past, and the French Jewish community is completely fractured. Marine Le Pen's incredible sleight of hand has made thousands of Jews forget the neo-fascist ideology of her far-right movement, which was founded by people nostalgic for Nazism and collaboration. And Eric Zemmour has completed her work, definitively pulverizing everything that had hitherto maintained a little coherence and cohesion in the French Jewish community.Much has been made of Zemmour's comments on Pétain, ""savior of the Jews,"" but those on Dreyfus have attracted less attention. That wasn't the only time Zemmour publicly pandered to anti-Semites: He defended Maurice Papon, convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity; proposed abolishing the Gayssot law, which punishes the crime of Holocaust denial; and cast aspersions on the Jewish children murdered by French jihadist Mohammed Merah because their family had buried them in Israel.But by casting doubt on Dreyfus's innocence, Zemmour came full circle, knowingly using the deniers' favorite figure of speech, understatement, the art of expressing the most by saying the least. A denier enjoys humbly presenting himself as an ignoramus: He's not a historian, he hasn't studied the subject and he doesn't have all the facts at hand to determine the existence of the gas chambers. With exactly the same cynicism, Zemmour explained that the Dreyfus affair is a ""troubled history,"" that ""nothing is obvious"" and that ""we'll never know the truth."" In so doing, what he was ensuring was the silence of Jews converted to right-wing extremism and verifying that no alarm bells were ringing in their heads.",Religions,belong generation jews born war political left matter course adolescence onward belong generation viscerally hated anything remotely related far right israel represented first foremost refuge parents grandparents victims nazism lacked even though made secret sympathy palestinians belong generation jewish french naturally meant loving maximilien robespierre revolution louise michel paris commune emile zola blum missak manouchian jean paul sartre belong generation jews suffering endured centuries seemed ever provide face tolerance solidarity culture course distant days french jews shared reference points values regardless convictions beliefs least three inviolable memories common sham alfred dreyfus affair jewish military captain convicted treason crimes collaborationist philippe tain regime horror holocaust lot meant possible debate everything else together strong opposition without tearing apart even within conservative representative council jewish institutions crif today alas belongs past french jewish community completely fractured marine pens incredible sleight hand made thousands jews forget neo fascist ideology far right movement founded people nostalgic nazism collaboration eric zemmour completed work definitively pulverizing everything hitherto maintained little coherence cohesion french jewish community much made zemmours comments tain savior jews dreyfus attracted less attention wasnt time zemmour publicly pandered anti semites defended maurice papon convicted complicity crimes humanity proposed abolishing gayssot law punishes crime holocaust denial cast aspersions jewish children murdered french jihadist mohammed merah family buried israel casting doubt dreyfuss innocence zemmour came full circle knowingly using deniers favorite figure speech understatement art expressing saying least denier enjoys humbly presenting ignoramus hes historian hasnt studied subject doesnt facts hand determine existence gas chambers exactly cynicism zemmour explained dreyfus affair troubled history nothing obvious well never know truth ensuring silence jews converted right wing extremism verifying alarm bells ringing heads,belong gener jew born war polit left matter cours adolesc onward belong gener viscer hate anyth remot relat far right israel repres first foremost refug parent grandpar victim nazism lack even though made secret sympathi palestinian belong gener jewish french natur meant love maximilien robespierr revolut louis michel pari commun emil zola blum missak manouchian jean paul sartr belong gener jew suffer endur centuri seem ever provid face toler solidar cultur cours distant day french jew share refer point valu regardless convict belief least three inviol memori common sham alfr dreyfu affair jewish militari captain convict treason crime collaborationist philipp tain regim horror holocaust lot meant possibl debat everyth els togeth strong opposit without tear apart even within conserv repres council jewish institut crif today ala belong past french jewish commun complet fractur marin pen incred sleight hand made thousand jew forget neo fascist ideolog far right movement found peopl nostalg nazism collabor eric zemmour complet work definit pulver everyth hitherto maintain littl coher cohes french jewish commun much made zemmour comment tain savior jew dreyfu attract less attent wasnt time zemmour publicli pander anti semit defend mauric papon convict complic crime human propos abolish gayssot law punish crime holocaust denial cast aspers jewish children murder french jihadist moham merah famili buri israel cast doubt dreyfuss innoc zemmour came full circl knowingli use denier favorit figur speech understat art express say least denier enjoy humbl present ignoramu he historian hasnt studi subject doesnt fact hand determin exist ga chamber exactli cynic zemmour explain dreyfu affair troubl histori noth obviou well never know truth ensur silenc jew convert right wing extrem verifi alarm bell ring head

The scheme would aim to ""mobilize 200 million euros over four years"", he said, arguing that many small towns found the cost of renovations ""unsustainable"".

Macron pampers French Catholics ahead of Pope visit to Marseille,    The French president announced the launch of a fund-raising campaign to renovate thousands of endangered religious buildings across the country and defended his intention to attend Pope Francis' mass in Marseille on September 23. ,"Between a trip to India on September 9-10 to attend the G20 summit and a visit to France by Charles III of the United Kingdom on September 20-22 ahead of a visit of Pope Francis on September 22-23, the trip was meant to be a quiet moment of ""proximity"" for the French president, a juncture of harmony with the so-called France of steeples, the one that worries at sight of its village churches falling into decay. Visiting Semur-en-Auxois and Bussy-Rabutin, Burgundy, on Friday, September 15, Emmanuel Macron appealed to the nation's generosity by launching a fundraising campaign to restore religious buildings needing repair.But the anouncement did not come without its share of controversy. When Macron reached Semur-en-Auxois at around midday, the streets were sparsely populated as a result of drastic traffic restrictions. Alain Houpert, a French local senator affiliated with the conservative party Les Républicains, said on X (formerly Twitter) that he would ignore the visit, which, he said, no longer carried any ""republican"" features. A few dozen citizens had been safely tucked away from the journalists in a corner of Semur-en-Auxois' church square that Macron had come to visit. He received a few cheers, and an isolated hoot, before greeting the crowd and entering the church with his wife Brigitte, French television host Stéphane Bern, who's been appointed to safegard France's endangered heritage, and local representatives.The coincidence of this presidential outing with the Pope's forthcoming visit could be interpreted as an attempt by Macron to send a message to Catholics. When leaving the church, he felt the need to explain his decision to attend the mass to be celebrated by the pontiff in Marseille on September 23. ""It's my responsibility to go,"" he said, adding he would not be going ""as a Catholic"" but as the ""president of the French Republic, which is indeed secular."" He said he would not be ""practicing religion"" during the mass.""No, Mr. President, it's not your responsibility to go to the Pope's mass,"" said Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the radical-left party La France Insoumise. ""To welcome him on arrival and even on departure: yes, of course. But the secular state neither recognizes nor subsidizes any religion.""As for Friday's religious heritage trip, the presidency denied it was related to Pope Francis' arrival. ""It's a commitment made on June 5,"" said an adviser at the Elysée. ""It's linked to the European Heritage Days [September 16-17] and in no way to the Pope's visit."" On June 5, on the sidelines of a visit to the Catholic site Mont-Saint-Michel, western France, Macron had outlined a national campaign supporting religious heritage.",Religions,trip india september attend summit visit france charles iii united kingdom september ahead visit pope francis september trip meant quiet moment proximity french president juncture harmony called france steeples one worries sight village churches falling decay visiting semur auxois bussy rabutin burgundy friday september emmanuel macron appealed nations generosity launching fundraising campaign restore religious buildings needing repair anouncement come without share controversy macron reached semur auxois around midday streets sparsely populated result drastic traffic restrictions alain houpert french local senator affiliated conservative party les publicains said formerly twitter would ignore visit said longer carried republican features dozen citizens safely tucked away journalists corner semur auxois church square macron come visit received cheers isolated hoot greeting crowd entering church wife brigitte french television host phane bern whos appointed safegard frances endangered heritage local representatives coincidence presidential outing popes forthcoming visit could interpreted attempt macron send message catholics leaving church felt need explain decision attend mass celebrated pontiff marseille september responsibility said adding would going catholic president french republic indeed secular said would practicing religion mass president responsibility popes mass said jean luc lenchon leader radical left party france insoumise welcome arrival even departure yes course secular state neither recognizes subsidizes religion fridays religious heritage trip presidency denied related pope francis arrival commitment made june said adviser elys linked european heritage days september way popes visit june sidelines visit catholic site mont saint michel western france macron outlined national campaign supporting religious heritage,trip india septemb attend summit visit franc charl iii unit kingdom septemb ahead visit pope franci septemb trip meant quiet moment proxim french presid junctur harmoni call franc steepl one worri sight villag church fall decay visit semur auxoi bussi rabutin burgundi friday septemb emmanuel macron appeal nation generos launch fundrais campaign restor religi build need repair anounc come without share controversi macron reach semur auxoi around midday street spars popul result drastic traffic restrict alain houpert french local senat affili conserv parti le publicain said formerli twitter would ignor visit said longer carri republican featur dozen citizen safe tuck away journalist corner semur auxoi church squar macron come visit receiv cheer isol hoot greet crowd enter church wife brigitt french televis host phane bern who appoint safegard franc endang heritag local repres coincid presidenti outing pope forthcom visit could interpret attempt macron send messag cathol leav church felt need explain decis attend mass celebr pontiff marseil septemb respons said ad would go cathol presid french republ inde secular said would practic religion mass presid respons pope mass said jean luc lenchon leader radic left parti franc insoumis welcom arriv even departur ye cours secular state neither recogn subsid religion friday religi heritag trip presid deni relat pope franci arriv commit made june said advis eli link european heritag day septemb way pope visit june sidelin visit cathol site mont saint michel western franc macron outlin nation campaign support religi heritag
"'By coming to Marseille, Pope Francis is continuing the Catholic habit of creating mobilizing utopias'","The head of the Catholic Church is coming to Marseille to expound his fantasized vision of a Mediterranean region united under one great monotheistic matrix, writes Blandine Chelini-Pont, professor of history at the University of Aix-Marseille.","Pope Francis is coming ""to Marseille,"" not ""to France."" His somewhat abrupt response to the journalist who questioned him at a press conference on August 6 was not a communication blunder. Of course, it is only natural that our local and national authorities have decided to make the most of the event, if only because of the huge organizational and security effort it requires. But Francis has his own agenda. And in a way, he is not coming to see the Marseille people either. No, Francis is coming to talk about the plight of migrants in the Mediterranean. He is coming to Marseilles as Vincent de Paul once did, the saintly man filled with compassion for the arsenal galley slaves. Francis has come to shake people's consciences, at a time when the countries the migrants are trying to reach are feeling their recurring flows as a growing threat.Francis is also arriving with a broader project, a vision of the Mediterranean. In this, he is continuing the Catholic trend of creating mobilizing utopias, representations that are both political and spiritual, exercises in imagination and interpretation, together capable of displaying realities that do not yet exist but are destined to happen. One of these realities, European unity, inspired the whole of the 20th century. And the European utopia took shape, accompanied by a whole lineage of idealists bent on erasing bellicose nationalism and predatory totalitarianism in the communitarian objective.Francis' Mediterranean utopia is not only for Catholics, but is de facto for all other believers in the Mediterranean, especially Muslims. It endows the ex-Mare Nostrum with a special vocation: ""The Mediterranean,"" Francis asserted in Bari, February 2020, ""is the sea of crossbreeding, forever culturally open to encounter, dialogue and reciprocal inculturation."" As with Europe, Francis's Mediterranean dream embraces the idea of a common civilization. But while a united Europe drew its pontifical justifications from the fertile matrix of a single great Roman-Christian civilization, Pope Francis' Mediterranean is justified by the existence of a great monotheistic matrix, beyond its Christian imprints.His vision of the divine breath is multilateral, rendering obsolete any Latin affirmation of unity forged by a few centuries of Roman-Byzantine empires and religious monopoly. Francis is taking the Mediterranean on a kind of great leap forward, where the practice and effectiveness of encounter, the cross-fertilization and peaceful intermingling of Revelations would characterize its authentic civilization.

The French Catholic far right is no longer holding back against Pope Francis,"    Ahead of the pope's visit to Marseille in southern France on September 22 and 23, Eric Zemmour and his supporters have launched a political offensive against the pontiff for his humanist approach to migrants. ","Francis is not their pope anymore, and they are not afraid to say so out loud. Just a few days before the pope's visit to Marseille on September 22 and 23 – and as a new influx of migrants disembarked on the Italian island of Lampedusa has rekindled European debates on the migratory crisis – a section of the French far right, which has certainly never been fond of the Argentinian pope, is adopting a stance that deviates from the conventional Catholic stance on pontiffs.Leaders of Eric Zemmour's Reconquête! party are not upset about the French president's planned attendance at the pontifical mass. In their eyes, this is not a matter for controversy, nor is it according to the right-wing Les Républicains (LR). Fifty-seven LR senators introduced a bill on Monday to ""enshrine France's Judeo-Christian roots"" in Article 1 of the Constitution. This initiative, which came just a few days before the pope's visit, was prompted by LR senator Stéphane Le Rudulier, whose constituency includes Marseille, and who is a spokesperson for Bruno Retailleau, head of the LR senators. The latter spoke on Tuesday morning on radio France Inter of a ""flood of migrants"" in Lampedusa.The presence of Pope Francis and his planned speech on migrants is what is bothering the most radical fringe of the far right. Zemmour and his allies Marion Maréchal and Stéphane Ravier have even invoked the Bible or Christian authors in their criticisms. ""I disagree with Pope Francis,"" declared Maréchal, the granddaughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen who will lead Reconquête in the European elections, on BFM-TV on September 14. She questioned the pontiff's emphasis on charity. ""I think [he] has no business in politics, and he's too involved in it,"" said Maréchal, who professes her Catholic faith. ""The pope is only infallible on dogma, and in this case, he's looking through the lens of a South American who doesn't know the type of immigration we're experiencing and obviously doesn't fully understand what we're facing.""""From Christianity, I learned a very beautiful idea of Saint Augustine's – you can't do good to the point of evil,"" echoed Zemmour on BFM-TV on Sunday, in a statement which, according to several exegetes, invented a quotation from the Roman philosopher and theologian. Jean-Marie Salamito, a specialist in the history of Christianity in the ancient world, said that he had been unable to find ""either in French or in Latin"" the idea – or anything similar – ""incorrectly attributed"" to Saint Augustine. ""The idea that one can do good and end up with evil seems neither Augustinian nor Christian to me,"" this associate member of the Institute of Augustinian Studies told the newspaper La Croix.",Religions,francis pope anymore afraid say loud days popes visit marseille september new influx migrants disembarked italian island lampedusa rekindled european debates migratory crisis section french far right certainly never fond argentinian pope adopting stance deviates conventional catholic stance pontiffs leaders eric zemmours reconqu party upset french presidents planned attendance pontifical mass eyes matter controversy according right wing les publicains fifty seven senators introduced bill monday enshrine frances judeo christian roots article constitution initiative came days popes visit prompted senator phane rudulier whose constituency includes marseille spokesperson bruno retailleau head senators latter spoke tuesday morning radio france inter flood migrants lampedusa presence pope francis planned speech migrants bothering radical fringe far right zemmour allies marion mar chal phane ravier even invoked bible christian authors criticisms disagree pope francis declared mar chal granddaughter jean marie pen lead reconqu european elections bfm september questioned pontiffs emphasis charity think business politics hes involved said mar chal professes catholic faith pope infallible dogma case hes looking lens south american doesnt know type immigration experiencing obviously doesnt fully understand facing christianity learned beautiful idea saint augustines cant good point evil echoed zemmour bfm sunday statement according several exegetes invented quotation roman philosopher theologian jean marie salamito specialist history christianity ancient world said unable find either french latin idea anything similar incorrectly attributed saint augustine idea one good end evil seems neither augustinian christian associate member institute augustinian studies told newspaper croix,franci pope anymor afraid say loud day pope visit marseil septemb new influx migrant disembark italian island lampedusa rekindl european debat migratori crisi section french far right certainli never fond argentinian pope adopt stanc deviat convent cathol stanc pontiff leader eric zemmour reconqu parti upset french presid plan attend pontif mass eye matter controversi accord right wing le publicain fifti seven senat introduc bill monday enshrin franc judeo christian root articl constitut initi came day pope visit prompt senat phane ruduli whose constitu includ marseil spokesperson bruno retailleau head senat latter spoke tuesday morn radio franc inter flood migrant lampedusa presenc pope franci plan speech migrant bother radic fring far right zemmour alli marion mar chal phane ravier even invok bibl christian author critic disagre pope franci declar mar chal granddaught jean mari pen lead reconqu european elect bfm septemb question pontiff emphasi chariti think busi polit he involv said mar chal profess cathol faith pope infal dogma case he look len south american doesnt know type immigr experienc obvious doesnt fulli understand face christian learn beauti idea saint augustin cant good point evil echo zemmour bfm sunday statement accord sever exeget invent quotat roman philosoph theologian jean mari salamito specialist histori christian ancient world said unabl find either french latin idea anyth similar incorrectli attribut saint augustin idea one good end evil seem neither augustinian christian associ member institut augustinian studi told newspap croix
Pavard scores two headers to secure France's victory over Scotland,    The French defender became the unlikely hero in the French football team's 4-1 triumph over Scotland in a friendly in Lille on Tuesday. ,"Defender Benjamin Pavard scored twice and Kylian Mbappé struck from the spot as France came from behind to beat Scotland 4-1 in a friendly in Lille on Tuesday, October 17.Kick-off was delayed by 10 minutes due to increased security measures after two Swedes were shot dead in an attack in Brussels on Monday before a Euro 2024 qualifier between Belgium and Sweden that was later abandoned.Billy Gilmour gave Scotland a surprise lead in the 11th minute, sweeping sweetly into the far corner after an inexplicable mistake by Eduardo Camavinga.But France, who qualified for Euro 2024 last week like Scotland, hit back five minutes later as Pavard glanced home Antoine Griezmann's corner at the near post.Pavard then became the first France player to score two headed goals in the same game since Zinedine Zidane in the 1998 World Cup final, diving to nod in a cross from Mbappé after excellent work by the France captain. ""I felt like I could score tonight,"" said Pavard, who left Bayern Munich for Inter Milan in August. ""Someone told me 'You're going to score' and I got two, so even better.""Mbappé, whose brace in Friday's 2-1 win in the Netherlands secured qualification, netted a third for the hosts with a penalty after Liam Cooper was punished for grabbing a fistful of Olivier Giroud's shirt.Kingsley Coman slammed in a fourth with 20 minutes to play after Griezmann stabbed against the crossbar from point-blank range.France round out their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign with games against Gibraltar and Greece next month. Didier Deschamps' side have six wins from six in Group B and are guaranteed to finish top.Scotland, who dropped their first points in Group A after losing 2-0 to Spain last Thursday, are away to Georgia before finishing up at home to Norway.""We have a good team in there.

"'I was a kind of object and that's what I wanted to be': Jane Birkin, from 1969 to #MeToo","    Fifty years before #MeToo, a young Englishwoman sang a duet with an older Serge Gainsbourg. Sexual liberation had found an anthem and a muse. In 2019, at the age of 73, the artist drew up a bittersweet assessment of those years with Le Monde. Read the republished interview following the singer's death on July 16, 2023. ","This article was originally published by Le Monde in French in December 2019.Jane Birkin arrived in Paris just after May 1968 to shoot the film Slogan with Serge Gainsbourg. Their meeting became an affair. He took her to his room at his parents' home on Avenue Bugeaud in the fancy 16th arrondissement of Paris and played her the song Je t'aime... Moi non plus, (""I love you… me neither""), which was recorded with Brigitte Bardot, Gainsbourg's lover for a few months and whose photos lined the walls. He explained that Bardot was married and had refused to allow the song to be released. Finally, he proposed that Birkin cover it, and she said yes.They made the recording in a London studio. ""I go, I go and I come/between your loins/I go and I come inside you and I'm holding back."" Her sung response was an octave above that of Bardot, regarded then as the most beautiful woman in the world. ""No! Come now!"" Birkin sang. This was a century after Arthur Rimbaud's Sonnet du Trou du Cul (""Sonnet to the Asshole""), but it was enough for the head of the Phonogram label to tell them, ""I'm willing to go to jail for a long-play record, but not a short one!""Gainsbourg wrote 69 Année Érotique (""69, Erotic Year"") in the middle of the night. He wrote 10 tracks for the album that would be forbidden for under 18s, with only Jane Birkin's face on the cover. ""It was Serge who wanted me to be alone. He wanted me to have success in France."" It was more than success that she received: She became known for her androgynous body, for her big clear eyes and her heart-shaped lips. In other words, she became the embodiment of the sexual liberation that seemed to be contained in the album – an album that radio stations around the world didn't know how to handle.This was a long time ago. Année Érotique is now over 50 years old. Celebrating with 73-year-old Birkin, Le Monde was met with a smile and a sympathetic sigh. ""I can't speak for my era. The other girls were much freer than I was. There was no one more impressed by a man than I was. I was delighted to be Serge's object of desire, the person who inspired him. I was happy to take naked pictures. To be in Playboy, even though I wasn't their type at all. I was a kind of object and that's what I wanted to be. It's true, I don't know what it would be like today."" What is the significance of today? Other than the realization that female emancipation has moved at a much slower pace than sexual liberation. That there are tuxedo-clad aggressors on the red carpets of Cannes, as there are on every step of society. #MeToo has spread across social media, with women across the Western world denouncing and sharing their experiences and horrible memories.",Obituaries,article originally published monde french december jane birkin arrived paris may shoot film slogan serge gainsbourg meeting became affair took room parents home avenue bugeaud fancy arrondissement paris played song taime moi non plus love neither recorded brigitte bardot gainsbourgs lover months whose photos lined walls explained bardot married refused allow song released finally proposed birkin cover said yes made recording london studio come loins come inside holding back sung response octave bardot regarded beautiful woman world come birkin sang century arthur rimbauds sonnet trou cul sonnet asshole enough head phonogram label tell willing jail long play record short one gainsbourg wrote ann rotique erotic year middle night wrote tracks album would forbidden jane birkins face cover serge wanted alone wanted success france success received became known androgynous body big clear eyes heart shaped lips words became embodiment sexual liberation seemed contained album album radio stations around world didnt know handle long time ago ann rotique years old celebrating year old birkin monde met smile sympathetic sigh cant speak era girls much freer one impressed man delighted serges object desire person inspired happy take naked playboy even though wasnt type kind object thats wanted true dont know would like today significance today realization female emancipation moved much slower pace sexual liberation tuxedo clad aggressors red carpets cannes every step society metoo spread across social media women across western world denouncing sharing experiences horrible memories,articl origin publish mond french decemb jane birkin arriv pari may shoot film slogan serg gainsbourg meet becam affair took room parent home avenu bugeaud fanci arrondiss pari play song taim moi non plu love neither record brigitt bardot gainsbourg lover month whose photo line wall explain bardot marri refus allow song releas final propos birkin cover said ye made record london studio come loin come insid hold back sung respons octav bardot regard beauti woman world come birkin sang centuri arthur rimbaud sonnet trou cul sonnet asshol enough head phonogram label tell will jail long play record short one gainsbourg wrote ann rotiqu erot year middl night wrote track album would forbidden jane birkin face cover serg want alon want success franc success receiv becam known androgyn bodi big clear eye heart shape lip word becam embodi sexual liber seem contain album album radio station around world didnt know handl long time ago ann rotiqu year old celebr year old birkin mond met smile sympathet sigh cant speak era girl much freer one impress man delight serg object desir person inspir happi take nake playboy even though wasnt type kind object that want true dont know would like today signific today realiz femal emancip move much slower pace sexual liber tuxedo clad aggressor red carpet cann everi step societi metoo spread across social media women across western world denounc share experi horribl memori
"Tony Bennett, last of classic American crooners, dies aged 96","    When he was 88, Bennett became the oldest person ever to reach number one on the US album sales chart. He died in New York, on Friday. ","Tony Bennett, the last in a generation of classic American crooners whose ceaselessly cheery spirit bridged generations to make him a hitmaker across seven decades, died Friday in New York. He was 96.Raised in an era when big bands defined US pop music, Bennett achieved an improbable second act when he started winning over young audiences in the 1990s – not by reinventing himself but by demonstrating his sheer joy in belting out the standards.And then at age 88, Bennett in 2014 became the oldest person ever to reach number one on the US album sales chart through a collection of duets with Lady Gaga – who became his friend and touring companion but only one of a long list of younger stars who rushed to work with the singing great.Likened since the start of his career to Frank Sinatra, Bennett first tried to distance himself but eventually followed much of the same path as other crooners of yore – singing in nightclubs, on television and for movies, although his attempts to act ended quickly.His gift proved to be his stage presence.With a welcoming smile and dapper suit, he sang with gusto and a smooth vibrato in a strong, clearly enunciated voice, which he kept in shape through training from the operatic Bel Canto tradition.Starting with his recording of the film song ""Because of You"" in 1951, Bennett sang dozens of hits including ""Rags to Riches,"" ""Stranger in Paradise"" and, in what would become his signature tune, ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco,"" which landed him two of his career's 19 Grammy Awards.Tony Bennett – his stage name came after advice from showbiz A-lister Bob Hope – was born Anthony Dominick Benedetto in the Astoria neighborhood of New York's Queens borough.His father was a struggling grocer who immigrated from southern Italy's Calabria region, to which his mother also traced her ancestry.He showed early promise as an entertainer, singing at age nine next to legendary New York mayor Fiorello LaGuardia when he ceremonially opened the city's Triborough Bridge, now known as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge.But his father's death at age 10, at a time when the United States was still struggling to exit the Great Depression, led him to leave school and earn money through jobs including singing at Italian restaurants and caricature painting, which remained a lifelong side career.During World War II, Bennett was drafted into the 63rd Infantry Division and was sent to France and Germany. But he was demoted after cursing out an officer from the South who objected to Bennett dining with an African American friend in the then racially segregated army.As punishment, Bennett spent his tour of duty digging out bodies and shipping them. But after the Allied victory, Bennett found an unexpected break into music as he waited with fellow troops in Wiesbaden, Germany to return home.With the city's opera house still intact, a US Army band performed a weekly show to be broadcast on military radio across Germany. Taken on as the band's librarian, Bennett quickly impressed with his voice and was made one of four vocalists.""During this period in the army, I enjoyed the most musical freedom I've ever had in my life,"" Bennett later wrote in his autobiography, The Good Life.""I could sing whatever I wanted, and there was no one around to tell me any different,"" he wrote.Bennett was married three times and had four children including Antonia Bennett, who has followed his path as a singer of pop and jazz standards.By the early 1990s, Bennett – his style and look little changed from the 1960s, except for more gray hair – was appearing in music videos on MTV and singing warm-up at concerts by alternative rock giants such as Smashing Pumpkins and Porno for Pyros.Proof that Bennett was back came in 1993 when he presented a prize at the MTV Video Music Awards alongside the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who hailed his cool factor and playfully sang part of ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco.""His career only kept building and a decade later, he released three successful albums of duets. On one of them, ""Body and Soul,"" he sang with Amy Winehouse in her last recording before she died in 2011 at age 27.He marked his 90th birthday with a star-studded concert at New York's Radio City Music Hall, which was turned into a television special and album.Upon turning 95, Bennett played two more birthday concerts, again at Radio City Music Hall, with Lady Gaga – shows billed as his farewell to New York.He then canceled the remainder of his 2021 tour dates on ""doctors' orders.""""And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing / And I will stay younger than spring,"" he crooned during the first of his farewell shows, in a rendition of his ballad ""This Is All I Ask.""""You've been a good audience,"" Bennett said prior to his encore.

Over a hundred American birds will soon be renamed,"    The American Ornithological Society wants to rename birds named after people, especially those with racist or offensive pasts, naming them instead for their physical characteristics. ","The Audubon shearwater is disappearing. The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List of Threatened Species has maintained that this bird is in no danger. Ornithology reference sites describe its presence across almost the entire American continent, from the northern Arctic to southern Brazil. However, in one or two years' time, this great sea traveler will no longer exist – at least under that name. On November 1, the American Ornithological Society (AOS) announced that it would be changing the common names of all birds on the continent ""named directly after people (eponyms), along with other names deemed offensive and exclusionary.""To the press release published by this scientific society, its president, Colleen Handel, added a personal statement: ""There is power in a name, and some English bird names have associations with the past that continue to be exclusionary and harmful today,"" she wrote. ""We need a much more inclusive and engaging scientific process that focuses attention on the unique features and beauty of the birds themselves."" From now on, common names will therefore reference the animals' physical characteristics or their habitat: White-faced shearwater, long-tailed shearwater, burrowing shearwater, etc. An open Community Congress hosted by the AOS' Diversity & Inclusion Committee was convened to inform the AOS Council's decisions.Admittedly, those American figures commemorated in the continent's winged animals' names have until now not all been the most commendable. In 2020, the research society had already renamed the thick-billed longspur – previously known as McCown's longspur. Honoring a Confederate general and defender of slavery in this way no longer seemed possible, regardless of his love of birds. Yet the list goes on. Didn't Scott's oriole commend another general, who – while loyal to the Union – was a commander in the Trail of Tears, the forced removal of native populations from their ancestral homelands, including the Cherokees? Additionally, should Townsend's warbler immortalize John Kirk Townsend (1809-1851), who hunted down birds in America's skies but also skulls in its indigenous peoples' graves?Painter and naturalist Jean-Jacques Audubon (John James Audubon to Americans, 1785-1851) has so far posed a problem of a rather different scale. On the face of things, he was the most celebrated figure in American ornithological history and the author of a considerable body of work. On the other side, he was a landowner and slaveholder who always opposed abolition. In March, the National Audubon Society decided to retain his name. The institution's staff union has abandoned it.",Science,audubon shearwater disappearing iucn international union conservation nature red list threatened species maintained bird danger ornithology reference sites describe presence across almost entire american continent northern arctic southern brazil however one two years time great sea traveler longer exist least name november american ornithological society aos announced would changing common names birds continent named directly people eponyms along names deemed offensive exclusionary press release published scientific society president colleen handel added personal statement power name english bird names associations past continue exclusionary harmful today wrote need much inclusive engaging scientific process focuses attention unique features beauty birds common names therefore reference animals physical characteristics habitat white faced shearwater long tailed shearwater burrowing shearwater etc open community congress hosted aos diversity inclusion committee convened inform aos councils decisions admittedly american figures commemorated continents winged animals names commendable research society already renamed thick billed longspur previously known mccowns longspur honoring confederate general defender slavery way longer seemed possible regardless love birds yet list goes didnt scotts oriole commend another general loyal union commander trail tears forced removal native populations ancestral homelands including cherokees additionally townsends warbler immortalize john kirk townsend hunted birds americas skies also skulls indigenous peoples graves painter naturalist jean jacques audubon john james audubon americans far posed problem rather different scale face things celebrated figure american ornithological history author considerable body work side landowner slaveholder always opposed abolition march national audubon society decided retain name institutions staff union abandoned,audubon shearwat disappear iucn intern union conserv natur red list threaten speci maintain bird danger ornitholog refer site describ presenc across almost entir american contin northern arctic southern brazil howev one two year time great sea travel longer exist least name novemb american ornitholog societi ao announc would chang common name bird contin name directli peopl eponym along name deem offens exclusionari press releas publish scientif societi presid colleen handel ad person statement power name english bird name associ past continu exclusionari harm today wrote need much inclus engag scientif process focus attent uniqu featur beauti bird common name therefor refer anim physic characterist habitat white face shearwat long tail shearwat burrow shearwat etc open commun congress host ao divers inclus committe conven inform ao council decis admittedli american figur commemor contin wing anim name commend research societi alreadi renam thick bill longspur previous known mccown longspur honor confeder gener defend slaveri way longer seem possibl regardless love bird yet list goe didnt scott oriol commend anoth gener loyal union command trail tear forc remov nativ popul ancestr homeland includ cheroke addit townsend warbler immort john kirk townsend hunt bird america sky also skull indigen peopl grave painter naturalist jean jacqu audubon john jame audubon american far pose problem rather differ scale face thing celebr figur american ornitholog histori author consider bodi work side landown slavehold alway oppos abolit march nation audubon societi decid retain name institut staff union abandon
"Randy Meisner, founding member of the Eagles, dies at 77","    The singer of 'Take it to the Limit' died of complications from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the Eagles said. Meisner joined the band in the early 1970s to be part of one of the most popular acts in history. ","Randy Meisner, a founding member of the Eagles who added high harmonies to such favorites as ""Take It Easy"" and ""The Best of My Love"" and stepped out front for the waltz-time ballad ""Take It to the Limit"" has died, the band said on Thursday, July 27.Meisner died Wednesday night in Los Angeles of complications from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the Eagles said in a statement. He was 77. The bassist had endured numerous afflictions in recent years and personal tragedy in 2016 when his wife, Lana Rae Meisner, accidentally shot herself and died. Meanwhile, Randy Meisner had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had severe issues with alcohol, according to court records and comments made during a 2015 hearing in which a judge ordered Meisner to receive constant medical care.Called ""the sweetest man in the music business"" by former bandmate Don Felder, the baby-faced Meisner joined Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Bernie Leadon in the early 1970s to form a quintessential Los Angeles band and one of the most popular acts in history. ""Randy was an integral part of the Eagles and instrumental in the early success of the band,"" the Eagles' statement said. ""His vocal range was astonishing, as is evident on his signature ballad, 'Take It to the Limit.'""Evolving from country rock to hard rock, the Eagles turned out a run of hit singles and albums over the next decade, starting with ""Take It Easy"" and continuing with ""Desperado,"" ""Hotel California"" and ""Life In the Fast Lane"" among others. Although chastised by many critics as slick and superficial, the Eagles released two of the most popular albums of all time, Hotel California and Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) with sales at 38 million.Led by singer-songwriters Henley and Frey, the Eagles were initially branded as ""mellow"" and ""easy listening."" But by their third album, 1974's On the Border, they had added a rock guitarist, Felder, and were turning away from country and bluegrass.Leadon, an old-fashioned bluegrass picker, was unhappy with the new sound and left after the 1975 album One of These Nights. (He was replaced by another rock guitarist, Joe Walsh). Meisner stayed on through the 1976 release of Hotel California, the band’s most acclaimed record, but was gone soon after. His departure, ironically, was touched off by the song he co-wrote and was best known for, ""Take It to the Limit.""A shy Nebraskan torn between fame and family life, Meisner had been ill and homesick during the Hotel California tour (his first marriage was breaking up) and was reluctant to have the spotlight for ""Take It to the Limit,"" a showcase for his nasally tenor. His objections during a Knoxville, Tennessee concert in the summer of 1977 so angered Frey that the two argued backstage and Meisner left soon after. His replacement, Timothy B. Schmit, remained with the group over the following decades, along with Henley, Walsh and Frey, who died in 2016.As a solo artist, Meisner never approached the success of the Eagles, but did have hits with ""Hearts On Fire"" and ""Deep Inside My Heart"" and played on records by Walsh, James Taylor and Dan Fogelberg, among others.",Obituaries,randy meisner founding member eagles added high harmonies favorites take easy best love stepped front waltz time ballad take limit died band said thursday july meisner died wednesday night los angeles complications chronic obstructive pulmonary disease eagles said statement bassist endured numerous afflictions recent years personal tragedy wife lana rae meisner accidentally shot died meanwhile randy meisner diagnosed bipolar disorder severe issues alcohol according court records comments made hearing judge ordered meisner receive constant medical care called sweetest man music business former bandmate felder baby faced meisner joined henley glenn frey bernie leadon early form quintessential los angeles band one popular acts history randy integral part eagles instrumental early success band eagles statement said vocal range astonishing evident signature ballad take limit evolving country rock hard rock eagles turned run hit singles albums next decade starting take easy continuing desperado hotel california life fast lane among others although chastised many critics slick superficial eagles released two popular albums time hotel california greatest hits sales million led singer songwriters henley frey eagles initially branded mellow easy listening third album border added rock guitarist felder turning away country bluegrass leadon old fashioned bluegrass unhappy new sound left album one nights replaced another rock guitarist joe walsh meisner stayed release hotel california band acclaimed record gone soon departure ironically touched song wrote best known take limit shy nebraskan torn fame family life meisner ill homesick hotel california tour first marriage breaking reluctant spotlight take limit showcase nasally tenor objections knoxville tennessee concert summer angered frey two argued backstage meisner left soon replacement timothy schmit remained group following decades along henley walsh frey died solo artist meisner never approached success eagles hits hearts fire deep inside heart played records walsh james taylor dan fogelberg among others,randi meisner found member eagl ad high harmoni favorit take easi best love step front waltz time ballad take limit die band said thursday juli meisner die wednesday night lo angel complic chronic obstruct pulmonari diseas eagl said statement bassist endur numer afflict recent year person tragedi wife lana rae meisner accident shot die meanwhil randi meisner diagnos bipolar disord sever issu alcohol accord court record comment made hear judg order meisner receiv constant medic care call sweetest man music busi former bandmat felder babi face meisner join henley glenn frey berni leadon earli form quintessenti lo angel band one popular act histori randi integr part eagl instrument earli success band eagl statement said vocal rang astonish evid signatur ballad take limit evolv countri rock hard rock eagl turn run hit singl album next decad start take easi continu desperado hotel california life fast lane among other although chastis mani critic slick superfici eagl releas two popular album time hotel california greatest hit sale million led singer songwrit henley frey eagl initi brand mellow easi listen third album border ad rock guitarist felder turn away countri bluegrass leadon old fashion bluegrass unhappi new sound left album one night replac anoth rock guitarist joe walsh meisner stay releas hotel california band acclaim record gone soon departur iron touch song wrote best known take limit shi nebraskan torn fame famili life meisner ill homesick hotel california tour first marriag break reluct spotlight take limit showcas nasal tenor object knoxvil tennesse concert summer anger frey two argu backstag meisner left soon replac timothi schmit remain group follow decad along henley walsh frey die solo artist meisner never approach success eagl hit heart fire deep insid heart play record walsh jame taylor dan fogelberg among other
"Sinéad O'Connor, Irish singer, dies at 56",    The singer was known for hits like her cover of Prince's 'Nothing Compares 2 U' and for her strong voice and personality. ,"Sinéad O'Connor, the gifted Irish singer-songwriter who became a superstar in her mid-20s but was known as much for her private struggles and provocative actions as for her fierce and expressive music, has died at 56. ""It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Sinéad. Her family and friends are devastated and have requested privacy at this very difficult time,"" the singer's family said in a statement reported Wednesday, July 26, by the BBC and RTE, after initial reports by the Irish Times.""Her music was loved around the world and her talent was unmatched and beyond compare,"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a statement on social media.Recognizable by her shaved head and elfin features, O'Connor began her career singing on the streets of Dublin and soon rose to international fame. She was a star from her 1987 debut album The Lion and the Cobra and became a sensation in 1990 with her cover of Prince's ballad ""Nothing Compares 2 U,"" a seething, shattering performance that topped charts from Europe to Australia and was heightened by a promotional video featuring the gray-eyed O'Connor in intense close-up.""Nothing Compares 2 U"" received three Grammy nominations and was the featured track off her acclaimed album I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, which helped lead Rolling Stone to name her Artist of the Year in 1991. ""She proved that a recording artist could refuse to compromise and still connect with millions of listeners hungry for music of substance,"" the magazine declared.She was a lifelong non-conformist – she would say that she shaved her head in response to record executives pressuring her to be conventionally glamorous – but her political and cultural stances and troubled private life often overshadowed her music. She feuded with Frank Sinatra over her refusal to allow the playing of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at one of her shows and accused Prince of physically threatening her. In 1989 she declared her support for the Irish Republican Army, a statement she retracted a year later. Around the same time, she skipped the Grammy ceremony, saying it was too commercialized.A critic of the Catholic Church well before allegations sexual abuse were widely reported, O'Connor made headlines in October 1992 when she tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II while appearing live on NBC's Saturday Night Live and denounced the church as the enemy. Days later, she appeared at an all-star tribute for Bob Dylan at Madison Square Garden and was immediately booed. She was supposed to sing Dylan's ""I Believe in You,"" but switched to an a cappella version of Bob Marley's ""War,"" which she had sung on Saturday Night Live.In 1999, O'Connor caused uproar in Ireland when she became a priestess of the breakaway Latin Tridentine Church – a position that was not recognized by the mainstream Catholic Church. For many years, she called for a full investigation into the extent of the church's role in concealing child abuse by clergy. In 2010, when Pope Benedict XVI apologized to Ireland to atone for decades of abuse, O'Connor condemned the apology for not going far enough and called for Catholics to boycott Mass until there was a full investigation into the Vatican's role, which by 2018 was making international headlines.""People assumed I didn't believe in God. That's not the case at all. I'm Catholic by birth and culture and would be the first at the church door if the Vatican offered sincere reconciliation,"" she wrote in the Washington Post in 2010. O'Connor announced in 2018 that she had converted to Islam and would be adopting the name Shuhada' Davitt, later Shuhada Sadaqat – although she continued to use Sinéad O'Connor professionally.O'Connor was born on December 8, 1966. She had a difficult childhood, with a mother whom she alleged was abusive and encouraged her to shoplift. As a teenager she spent time in a church-sponsored institution for girls, where she said she washed priests' clothes for no wages. But a nun gave O'Connor her first guitar, and soon she sang and performed on the streets of Dublin, her influences ranging from Dylan to Siouxsie and the Banshees.Her performance with a local band caught the eye of a small record label, and, in 1987, O'Connor released The Lion and the Cobra, which sold hundreds of thousands of copies and featured the hit ""Mandinka,"" driven by a hard rock guitar riff and O'Connor's piercing vocals.""I suppose I've got to say that music saved me,"" she said in an interview with the Independent newspaper in 2013. ""I didn't have any other abilities, and there was no learning support for girls like me, not in Ireland at that time. It was either jail or music. I got lucky.""O'Connor's other musical credits included the albums Universal Mother and Faith and Courage, a cover of Cole Porter's ""You Do Something to Me"" from the AIDS fundraising album ""Red Hot + Blue"" and backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's ""Blood of Eden."" She received eight Grammy nominations overall and in 1991 won for best alternative musical performance.O'Connor announced she was retiring from music in 2003, but she continued to record new material. Her most recent album was ""I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss,"" released in 2014.The singer married four times; her union to drug counselor Barry Herridge, in 2011, lasted just 16 days. She was open about her private life, from her sexuality to her mental illness. She said she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and on social media wrote openly about taking her own life. When her teenage son Shane died by suicide in 2022, O'Connor tweeted there was ""no point living without him"" and was soon hospitalized.O'Connor had four children: Jake, with her first husband John Reynolds; Roisin, with John Waters; Shane, with Donal Lunny; and Yeshua Bonadio, with Frank Bonadio.",Obituaries,sin oconnor gifted irish singer songwriter became superstar mid known much private

"With the death of Martin Walser, Germany loses one of its greatest post-war writers","    The author of 'Death of a Critic' and 'Marriage in Philippsburg' died on July 28, in Uberlingen near his beloved Lake Constance, aged 96. ","One of his latest books, published in 2018, is entitled Ich Würde Heute Ungern Sterben (""I Wouldn't Like to Die Today""). This nose-thumbing at death did not prevent the latter's zeal, which caught up with the German writer Martin Walser in Uberlingen, Germany, on Friday, July 28. He was 96 years old. But the provocative spirit of this outstanding stylist had, for over 60 years, ""left a decisive mark on German literature,"" in the words of the tribute paid to him by Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the president of the Federal Republic of Germany. Often satirically, his works – novels, essays, and plays – reveal the anxieties of middle-class people caught between the benefits of German economic prosperity and a nagging sense of personal failure. A world he knew well because it was his own.Walser was born on March 24, 1927, in Wasserburg am Bodensee, south of Germany, a region he had never left. He had been living in Uberlingen since the 1960s. The son of an innkeeper, he was orphaned by his father at the age of 10. Memories of this childhood are recalled in Ein springender Brunnen (""A gushing fountain""), a novel in which Walser not only recounts tales of his childhood but also the rise and fall of the Third Reich.As a teenager during World War II, he served in air defense. According to documents in the Nazi party's central file, he joined the party on January 30, 1944. However, this never brought him the same setbacks as Günter Grass (1927-2015), who was exactly the same age and also joined the armed services before being assigned to an anti-aircraft battery as a Luftwaffe auxiliary. No doubt Grass had waited too long, until 2006, to make this coming out. He had, until then, presented himself too much as a lesson-giver. Walser, on the other hand, was never attacked on the subject. He had always denied being a Nazi.In 1947, at age 20, he began studying literature, history, and philosophy in Regensburg, Bavaria, and later in Tübingen. At the same time, from 1949 onwards, he worked as a reporter and editor for the Süddeutscher Rundfunk radio station in Stuttgart. In 1952, he defended an authoritative thesis on Kafka when the author was still far from popular.In 1953, he became one of the youngest members of Group 47 – named after the group's first meeting in Munich in 1947. It was a literary think-tank grouped around writer Hans Werner Richter (1908-1993), which called for ""new means of form, style, and literature.""In 1957, his first novel Marriage in Philippsburg was a huge success. In a new era where the economic miracle has repressed the memory of Nazi barbarism, young journalist Hans Beumann finds himself frolicking in a world where the important matter is to make a career and flaunt success by showing off what one has acquired: Money, houses, mistresses. With this novel, the barely 30-year-old writer painted a masterly portrait of the young German Federal Republic and its variable-geometry morality.

"Paul Reubens, actor behind 'Pee-wee Herman,' has died at age 70",    The artist behind the lasting absurdist character – who found popularity in both film and TV – was privately dealing with cancer over the last number of years. ,"Paul Reubens, the US comic who became famous in the 1980s for playing eccentric man-child Pee-wee Herman, and later infamous for his arrest at an adult theater, has died aged 70.Mr. Reubens passed away Sunday, July 30, after a six-year battle with cancer which he had not publicly disclosed, according to a statement on the actor's official social media accounts.""Last night we said farewell to Paul Reubens, an iconic American actor, comedian, writer and producer whose beloved character Pee-wee Herman delighted generations of children and adults with his positivity, whimsy and belief in the importance of kindness,"" it said.""Paul bravely and privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit.""A Facebook post included a quotation posthumously attributed to Mr. Reubens.""Please accept my apology for not going public with what I've been facing the last six years,"" the quote read.Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel led the tributes, calling Mr. Reubens ""a brilliant and original comedian who made kids and their parents laugh at the same time.""""He never forgot a birthday and shared his genuine delight for silliness with everyone he met.

"Sophie Fillières, director of zany French comedies, has died at 58",    The French filmmaker and screenwriter behind 'Ouch' and 'Gentille' died on July 31. ,"Cinema can sometimes be used to invent a less rigid life, as the unclassifiable, high-minded comedies of French filmmaker Sophie Fillières were tirelessly striving to do.The filmmaker and screenwriter died on Monday, July 31, at 58, having just finished shooting her seventh feature film, Ma vie, ma gueule, with Agnès Jaoui and Philippe Katerine. Alongside Arnaud Desplechin, Noémie Lvovsky and Pascale Ferran, she was a worthy representative of the ""young French cinema"" of the 1990s, a graduate of the French national film school La Fémis and a product of the French New Wave, blending intimacy and romance. Fillières achieved this in her own very personal way: a dazzling back-and-forth in dialogue, a freewheeling burlesque of speech. Her wavering lovers – Judith Godrèche in Grande petite (1994), André Dussollier in Aïe (Ouch, 2000), Emmanuelle Devos in Gentille (2005) – are given to wild fabrication, building castles in the air, creating their stories through the sheer force of words.Born in Paris on November 20, 1964, to an Air France salesman and a math-teacher-turned-painter mother, Fillières was marked at the age of 16 by the discovery of Sauve qui peut (La vie) (Every Man for Himself), by Jean-Luc Godard. She entered La Fémis film school, the successor to the Institute for Advanced Cinematographic Studies, as a student director in 1986, and was a member of the very first graduating class in 1990 (along with Solveig Anspach, Emilie Deleuze, Arnaud des Pallières and Emmanuelle Demoris), under the influence of new cultural policies.She made a name for herself with her first short, Des filles et des chiens (""Of Girls and Dogs"", 1991), winner of the 1992 Jean Vigo prize, which opened as a double feature with Arnaud Desplechin's La Sentinelle (The Sentinel, 1992), laying the foundations for her style of cinema. Two girls, Sandrine Kiberlain and Hélène Fillières (her younger sister), walk down the street, idly speculating – ""Would you rather have a car accident and end up disfigured, or have your parents divorce?"" In five minutes, the two friends have exhausted the most improbable situations.She first made her mark as a contributor to other people's screenplays, co-writing Nord (North, 1991) by Xavier Beauvois, Oublie-moi (Forget Me, 1994) by Noémie Lvovsky, and Sombre (Somber, 1998) by Philippe Grandrieux. She continued to work as a rewriter throughout her career, most recently on Nicolas Maury's Garçon Chiffon (My Best Part, 2020). Her transition to feature films came in 1994 with Grande petite: the strange story of a babysitter who, one fine day, discovers a wad of banknotes and a gun in a plastic bag, a thriller which she uses to further confuse the threads of her love life. Audacious, but still somewhat hypothetical, this oxymoron paved the way for the psychotic, delirious comedies that followed.",Obituaries,cinema sometimes used invent less rigid life unclassifiable high minded comedies french filmmaker sophie filli res tirelessly striving filmmaker screenwriter died monday july finished shooting seventh feature film vie gueule agn jaoui philippe katerine alongside arnaud desplechin mie lvovsky pascale ferran worthy representative young french cinema graduate french national film school mis product french new wave blending intimacy romance filli res achieved personal way dazzling back forth dialogue freewheeling burlesque speech wavering lovers judith godr che grande petite andr dussollier ouch emmanuelle devos gentille given wild fabrication building castles air creating stories sheer force words born paris november air france salesman math teacher turned painter mother filli res marked age discovery sauve qui peut vie every man jean luc godard entered mis film school successor institute advanced cinematographic studies student director member first graduating class along solveig anspach emilie deleuze arnaud des palli res emmanuelle demoris influence new cultural policies made name first short des filles des chiens girls dogs winner jean vigo prize opened double feature arnaud desplechins sentinelle sentinel laying foundations style cinema two girls sandrine kiberlain filli res younger sister walk street idly speculating would rather car accident end disfigured parents divorce five minutes two friends exhausted improbable situations first made mark contributor peoples screenplays writing nord north xavier beauvois oublie moi forget mie lvovsky sombre somber philippe grandrieux continued work rewriter throughout career recently nicolas maurys gar chiffon best part transition feature films came grande petite strange story babysitter one fine day discovers wad banknotes gun plastic bag thriller uses confuse threads love life audacious still somewhat hypothetical oxymoron paved way psychotic delirious comedies followed,cinema sometim use invent less rigid life unclassifi high mind comedi french filmmak sophi filli re tirelessli strive filmmak screenwrit die monday juli finish shoot seventh featur film vie gueul agn jaoui philipp katerin alongsid arnaud desplechin mie lvovski pascal ferran worthi repres young french cinema graduat french nation film school mi product french new wave blend intimaci romanc filli re achiev person way dazzl back forth dialogu freewheel burlesqu speech waver lover judith godr che grand petit andr dussolli ouch emmanuel devo gentil given wild fabric build castl air creat stori sheer forc word born pari novemb air franc salesman math teacher turn painter mother filli re mark age discoveri sauv qui peut vie everi man jean luc godard enter mi film school successor institut advanc cinematograph studi student director member first graduat class along solveig anspach emili deleuz arnaud de palli re emmanuel demori influenc new cultur polici made name first short de fill de chien girl dog winner jean vigo prize open doubl featur arnaud desplechin sentinel sentinel lay foundat style cinema two girl sandrin kiberlain filli re younger sister walk street idli specul would rather car accid end disfigur parent divorc five minut two friend exhaust improb situat first made mark contributor peopl screenplay write nord north xavier beauvoi oubli moi forget mie lvovski sombr somber philipp grandrieux continu work rewrit throughout career recent nicola mauri gar chiffon best part transit featur film came grand petit strang stori babysitt one fine day discov wad banknot gun plastic bag thriller use confus thread love life audaci still somewhat hypothet oxymoron pave way psychot deliri comedi follow
"Geneviève de Fontenay, former president of the Miss France Committee, has died","    The emblematic figure of the Miss France pageant, nicknamed the 'Lady in the Hat,' died at the age of 90. ","Geneviève de Fontenay, former president of the Miss France committee, died at the age of 90, her son Xavier de Fontenay told the TF1 broadcaster on Wednesday, August 2. Born Geneviève Mullmann on August 30, 1932, in Longwy, eastern France, she was the eldest of 10 siblings. Her father, André, was a mining engineer at the Hagondange steelworks, while her mother, Marie-Thérèse, was a housewife and devout Catholic. Geneviève de Fontenay had an uneventful childhood with loving parents and a strict upbringing. Without much enthusiasm, she first enrolled at the hospitality management school in Strasbourg, but left at the age of 17 to attend a cosmetology school in Paris, and was later hired as an itinerant beautician.In 1952, she met the organizer of Miss France, Louis Poirot, known as ""de Fontenay,"" his pseudonym as a member of the French Resistance. It was at the Miss Carnac contest where she won an amateur model-making competition with him. She got back in touch with him in 1954. From then on, they never left each other's side, chose never to marry and had two sons, Ludovic – who died in 1984, aged 29 – and Xavier.She became secretary of the Miss France Committee in 1954, taking on many roles as chauffeur, steward, coach and costume designer, while her partner who was 24 years older was in charge of communications and presenting the election. Together, they crisscrossed France for more than 24 years, organizing elections and galas and driving their Citroën DS along the roads and through the countryside.When de Fontenay died in 1981 at the age of 73, Geneviève de Fontenay took over the reins of the Miss France Committee from her son Xavier, who became director of the Miss France company. As a Miss France salesperson, she hit the road again each season, covering more than 30,000 kilometers across France, expressing her love for the country's ""tradition, farmers and simple people."" It took a long time for this small business to become profitable, but on New Year's Eve 1986, the slightly old-fashioned regional show received unprecedented media coverage when TV presenter Guy Lux decided to broadcast the Miss France election live on FR3. The show was an immediate success and was broadcast in prime time on TF1 from 1995 onward. Every year, this television event is a hit, with audiences of between 12 and 15 million viewers.In 2002, her son Xavier decided to make a profit by selling the Miss France company to the reality TV production company Endemol, while retaining his title of director and Geneviève de Fontenay's role as president of the Miss France committee and deputy director.In 2004, former Miss France winner Sylvie Tellier took over the management of Endemol. Profound disagreements arose between the president-for-life and the company: Classicism imbued with traditional values on side, against a desire for modernism on the other – with the bikini replacing the legendary one-piece swimsuit. The ""Lady with the Hat,"" as she was nicknamed, argued that the Miss France brand was marked by ""deep-rooted France of the provinces, which acts as a counterbalance to that disheveled France."" Weary of all these changes, which she deemed vulgar, she finally abdicated in 2011 and launched a dissident pageant, Miss National, which was renamed Miss Prestige National after a court ruling.At the age of 83, de Fontenay announced her retirement from the fifth edition of Miss Prestige National, having worked for over 60 years to promote her conservative vision of French elegance. A favorite of the media, she continued to enjoy great popularity with the public and made frequent television appearances, even though times have changed and feminist organizations have repeatedly voiced their opposition to electing young women on the basis of their looks.",Obituaries,genevi fontenay former president miss france committee died age son xavier fontenay told broadcaster wednesday

"Henri Konan Bédié, former president and Machiavellian figure of Côte d'Ivoire, has died",    The leader of the Côte d'Ivoire Democratic Party died in Abidjan at the age of 89. He was one of the most powerful figures in the country's political life for half a century. ,"As if Henri Konan Bédié had almost escaped his human condition, few expected the 89-year-old's death on Tuesday, August 1. The former president of Côte d'Ivoire, who ruled between 1993 and 1999, was still the all-powerful master of the PDCI-RDA and one of the pillars of the country's political life. Known for his silence and calm, Bédié was preparing for the municipal and regional elections on September 2 and for his party's congress in October – two decisive events for the future of the PDCI in light of the 2025 presidential elections.As soon as Bédié's death was announced in Abidjan, where he had been rushed by helicopter from his fiefdom in Daoukro, central Côte d'Ivoire, a few hours earlier, dozens of PDCI-RDA supporters gathered at his villa in the Cocody district. ""I can't believe it because the day before yesterday, I was with him in Daoukro, we had lunch and talked together, he wasn't tired, he was in great shape, we took photos together. We were preparing for the elections with him, so it's a real blow,"" said Cyril Yobouet, coordinator of PDCI-RDA organizations.""I couldn't believe it, that's why I came here. We're going back into the field and we're going to ask our supporters to make sure that the PDCI-RDA wins the elections to pay this last tribute to our president,"" said Innocent Kouamé Kouassi, a candidate in the municipal elections in the town of Guitry, 150 km west of Abidjan.Born on May 5, 1934 in the village of Dadiékro, in the center of the country, ""N'Zueba"" (the child of rain, in Boulé) rose through the ranks rapidly. In the 1960s he joined the ""father of independence,"" Félix Houphouët-Boigny, in the PDCI-RDA, which was the sole party at the time.Aged only 26 he became Côte d'Ivoire's first ambassador to the US and Canada was later made the minister of the economy and finances at age 32. In 1980, he became president of the National Assembly, a position he held until 1993, when Houphouët-Boigny died. It was then that his conflict with Alassane Ouattara began, as both were vying to succeed the first Ivorian president. Their rivalry would never end.""HKB"" served as interim president until the 1995 elections. These two years were marked by an economic crisis, linked in particular to the downturn in the cocoa industry. Bédié promoted the controversial concept of ""ivoirité,"" a form of patriotism glorifying cultural identity and sovereignty that he also used as a pretext to suppress Muslim populations in the north. Bédié was accused of using ""ivoirité"" to disqualify Ouattara.",Obituaries,henri konan almost escaped human condition expected year olds death tuesday august former president divoire ruled still powerful master pdci rda one pillars countrys political life known silence calm preparing municipal regional elections september partys congress october two decisive events future pdci light presidential elections soon death announced abidjan rushed helicopter fiefdom daoukro central divoire hours earlier dozens pdci rda supporters gathered villa cocody district cant believe day yesterday daoukro lunch talked together wasnt tired great shape took photos together preparing elections real blow said cyril yobouet coordinator pdci rda organizations couldnt believe thats came going back field going ask supporters make sure pdci rda wins elections pay last tribute president said innocent kouam kouassi candidate municipal elections town guitry west abidjan born may village dadi kro center country nzueba child rain boul rose ranks rapidly joined father independence lix houphou boigny pdci rda sole party time aged became divoires first ambassador canada later made minister economy finances age became president national assembly position held houphou boigny died conflict alassane ouattara began vying succeed first ivorian president rivalry would never end hkb served interim president elections two years marked economic crisis linked particular downturn cocoa industry promoted controversial concept ivoirit form patriotism glorifying cultural identity sovereignty also used pretext suppress muslim populations north accused using ivoirit disqualify ouattara,henri konan almost escap human condit expect year old death tuesday august former presid divoir rule still power master pdci rda one pillar countri polit life known silenc calm prepar municip region elect septemb parti congress octob two decis event futur pdci light presidenti elect soon death announc abidjan rush helicopt fiefdom daoukro central divoir hour earlier dozen pdci rda support gather villa cocodi district cant believ day yesterday daoukro lunch talk togeth wasnt tire great shape took photo togeth prepar elect real blow said cyril yobouet coordin pdci rda organ couldnt believ that came go back field go ask support make sure pdci rda win elect pay last tribut presid said innoc kouam kouassi candid municip elect town guitri west abidjan born may villag dadi kro center countri nzueba child rain boul rose rank rapidli join father independ lix houphou boigni pdci rda sole parti time age becam divoir first ambassador canada later made minist economi financ age becam presid nation assembl posit held houphou boigni die conflict alassan ouattara began vy succeed first ivorian presid rivalri would never end hkb serv interim presid elect two year mark econom crisi link particular downturn cocoa industri promot controversi concept ivoirit form patriot glorifi cultur ident sovereignti also use pretext suppress muslim popul north accus use ivoirit disqualifi ouattara
"Konrad Klapheck, a painter who colored outside the lines, has died","    The German artist, who was one of the first to inscribe the power of machines in art, died on July 30 at the age of 88. ","German painter Konrad Klapheck passed away in his sleep on Sunday, July 30, in Düsseldorf, at the age of 88. Having suffered from Parkinson's disease for several years, he had stopped painting.Klapheck was born in Düsseldorf on February 10, 1935, to art historians. His father, Richard, was expelled from Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, the city's academy of fine arts, in 1934 by the Nazis and died shortly before the war. Konrad and his mother survived the bombing of Leipzig, where they had taken refuge. He then returned to his hometown in 1945. In 1954, he enrolled at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf and showed an interest in Surrealism when he visited Max Ernst in Paris that same year. ""I knew Pollock and Wols, I flirted with Art Informel, Tachisme and dripping,"" he said in 2005, recalling that period of his life.But rather than joining the trend, he radically opposed it. At the age of 20, in 1955, Klapheck decided to paint a typewriter as accurately as possible. The mechanical subject and the smooth, neutral style were the exact opposite of the celebration of the gestural and the unconscious, which were the hallmark of American action painting and European abstraction. Klapheck was one of the first to tackle this, and to inscribe the omnipotence and omnipresence of machines in art, a few years ahead of Parisian New Realism and New York Pop Art, which began to emerge in 1960. Although he was aware of what these artists had in common with him, Klapheck nevertheless kept his distance: ""I got on well with Klein and Arman. But they didn't invite me to join them,"" he said.He did not mind, because his first solo exhibition, in 1959 at the Galerie Schmela, also in Düsseldorf, was a success. He had established his own style and iconography. With the precision of an engineer, he depicted irons, sewing machines, punch presses, gas masks and Swiss Army knives, enlarged on canvases much bigger than the objects themselves and set against immaculate monochrome backgrounds. No power cords or metal cogs or joints were missing. The connection with Duchamp's ""machines célibataires"" (""bachelor machines"") was blatantly obvious, no less so than the connection with the torture device for condemned prisoners described by Kafka in his short story ""In the Penal Colony"" (1919). Without ever giving in to pathos, Klapheck invented the ironic art of technical cruelty.When he met André Breton in 1961, Klapheck found in him both a collector and an advocate: Breton wrote the preface for Klapheck's exhibition at the Ileana Sonnabend Gallery in Paris in 1965; included him in his selection of the 10 young artists most representative of the period; and invited him to take part in the exhibition ""L'Ecart absolu"" (""Absolute Deviation""), which was the last exhibition designed by Breton before his death. The surrealist tone of Klapheck's work was all the more noticeable given the titles he chose for his canvases, which sound like something that De Chirico or Magritte might have created: ""The Will to Power"" for a calculator, ""The Voice of Conscience"" for a machine tool and ""Splendor and Misery of the Reforms"" for a bulldozer.

"Hélène Carrère d'Encausse, first woman to head the Académie Française, has died","    The historian, who was the third female member of the institution and elected permanent secretary in 1999, died aged 94. ","Hélène Carrère d'Encausse, a historian of Tsarist and Soviet Russia and the third female member of the Académie Française, where she was the first woman to be elected permanent secretary in 1999, has died aged 94, her family announced on Saturday, August 5.Born Hélène Zourabichvili in Paris on July 6, 1929, to a Russian mother and a Georgian father, she arrived at a time when the fortune enjoyed by the Zourabichvili family a few decades earlier had become a mere memory – the fate of emigrants who had fled the Bolshevik revolution.The family had been great servants to the Romanov empire, as well as eminent scholars. They came from Georgia via Istanbul, and settled in France after the Soviet army invaded the fledgling Democratic Republic of Georgia in the late winter of 1921, less than three years after its birth on the ruins of the Tsarist empire. In 1936, the family expanded with the birth of Nicolas, who studied with Nadia Boulanger and went on to compose for both classical ensembles and the cinema, notably for Otar Iosseliani.Hélène learned to read at an early age, first French and then Russian, becoming familiar with the literature of both. Her father, Georges, a philosopher with a degree in political economy who became a cab driver before trying his hand at the import-export business, took the family to Bordeaux, where his mastery of five languages proved invaluable. But, working as an interpreter for the Germans during the Occupation, he was kidnapped during the Liberation, disappearing in October 1944 when he was probably killed.Returning to Paris with her mother, the teenaged Hélène was housed in the Russian Orthodox cathedral on Rue Daru. French neo-fascist journalist Maurice Bardèche, brother-in-law of collaborationist writer Robert Brasillach, met her in February 1950 and became attached to the girl who seemed to share his sense of ""anger and revolt"". In his book Souvenirs (1993), he wrote: ""She had the soul of a young heroine, but at the same time she was realistic, determined, lucid.""Despite this radical portrait, Hélène received a solid education at the Lycée Molière, then at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris. Born stateless, when she came of age she obtained French nationality. This was a momentous occasion for her and she wanted to take her oath on the flag, so she was appalled to learn that simply by not opposing naturalization before her 21st birthday, she had already become French by default – a fact she remembered when, in 1987, she was asked to sit on the commission for the reform of the nationality code.",Obituaries,carr dencausse historian tsarist soviet russia third female member acad mie fran aise first woman elected permanent secretary died aged family announced saturday august born zourabichvili paris july russian mother georgian father arrived time fortune enjoyed zourabichvili family decades earlier become mere memory fate emigrants fled bolshevik revolution family great servants romanov empire well eminent scholars came georgia via istanbul settled france soviet army invaded fledgling democratic republic georgia late winter less three years birth ruins tsarist empire family expanded birth nicolas studied nadia boulanger went compose classical ensembles cinema notably otar iosseliani learned read early age first french russian becoming familiar literature father georges philosopher degree political economy became cab driver trying hand import export business took family bordeaux mastery five languages proved invaluable working interpreter germans occupation kidnapped liberation disappearing october probably killed returning paris mother teenaged housed russian orthodox cathedral rue daru french neo fascist journalist maurice bard che brother law collaborationist writer robert brasillach met february became attached girl seemed share sense anger revolt book souvenirs wrote soul young heroine time realistic determined lucid despite radical portrait received solid education lyc moli institut detudes politiques paris born stateless came age obtained french nationality momentous occasion wanted take oath flag appalled learn simply opposing naturalization birthday already become french default fact remembered asked sit commission reform nationality code,carr dencauss historian tsarist soviet russia third femal member acad mie fran ais first woman elect perman secretari die age famili announc saturday august born zourabichvili pari juli russian mother georgian father arriv time fortun enjoy zourabichvili famili decad earlier becom mere memori fate emigr fled bolshevik revolut famili great servant romanov empir well emin scholar came georgia via istanbul settl franc soviet armi invad fledgl democrat republ georgia late winter less three year birth ruin tsarist empir famili expand birth nicola studi nadia boulang went compos classic ensembl cinema notabl otar iosseliani learn read earli age first french russian becom familiar literatur father georg philosoph degre polit economi becam cab driver tri hand import export busi took famili bordeaux masteri five languag prove invalu work interpret german occup kidnap liber disappear octob probabl kill return pari mother teenag hous russian orthodox cathedr rue daru french neo fascist journalist mauric bard che brother law collaborationist writer robert brasillach met februari becam attach girl seem share sens anger revolt book souvenir wrote soul young heroin time realist determin lucid despit radic portrait receiv solid educ lyc moli institut detud politiqu pari born stateless came age obtain french nation moment occas want take oath flag appal learn simpli oppos natur birthday alreadi becom french default fact rememb ask sit commiss reform nation code
"William Friedkin, Oscar-winning director of 'The French Connection' and 'The Exorcist', is dead at 87",    Friedkin was hailed as a leading member of a new generation of filmmakers. ,"William Friedkin, the Oscar-winning director who became a top filmmaker in his 30s with the gripping The French Connection and the horrifying The Exorcist and struggled in the following decades to match his early success has died. He was 87.Friedkin, who won the Best Director Oscar for The French Connection, died on Monday, August 7, Los Angeles, his wife, producer and former studio head Sherry Lansing told The Hollywood Reporter.The movie, based on a true story, deals with the efforts of maverick New York City police Detective James ""Popeye"" Doyle to track down Frenchman Fernando Rey, mastermind of a large drug pipeline funneling heroin into the United States. It contains one of the most thrilling chase scenes ever filmed.The movie also won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Screenplay and Film Editing and led critics to hail Friedkin, then just 32, as a leading member of a new generation of filmmakers. He followed with an even bigger blockbuster, The Exorcist, based on William Peter Blatty’s best-selling novel about a 12-year-old girl possessed by the devil.The harrowing scenes of the girl’s possession and a splendid cast, including Linda Blair as the girl, Ellen Burstyn as her mother and Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller as the priests who try to exorcise the devil from her, helped make the film a box-office sensation. It was so scary for its era that many viewers fled the theater before it was over and some reported being unable to sleep for days afterward.It received 10 Oscar nominations, including one for Friedkin as director, and won two, for Blatty’s script and for sound.With that second success, Friedkin would go on to direct movies and TV shows well into the 21st century.

"John Guez, the 'maestro' of Beaubourg, has died","    The artist long embodied the art of street theater in front of the Centre Pompidou in Paris. He died in Paris on August 2, at the age of 81. ","Born in Tunis on January 3, 1942, John Gilbert Youssef Guez, known as John Guez, passed away in Paris on Wednesday, August 2, at the age of 81. With a handsome face, childlike flexibility and energy, and an uncanny class, John Guez was a street performer and entertainer between 1977 and 2006. He was a fixture outside the Centre Georges-Pompidou from the moment it opened, regularly posted at the Place Edmond-Michelet in Paris's 4th arrondissement. The neighborhood, known as Beaubourg, had been home to the heyday of street theater since the 1960s (with the Living Theatre and Dario Fo), but Guez took the art form to one of its greatest peaks. The other artists in the square called him ""il Maestro.""Actors (Michel Piccoli, Michael Lonsdale, among others) used to slip incognito into the audience, a circle (sometimes a square) made up of ordinary passers-by, tourists, foreigners, lovers and lost souls from all over, whom Guez was skilled at gathering around him. His only prop was a bamboo wand, which he would use to summon the police, Sarkozy or God. Guez could spontaneously gather a crowd, maybe 100 or 200 passers-by, and get them to act. In a light-colored suit or white jacket, with his clothes elegantly rumpled, adding a spotlessly clean Columbo-style raincoat in the winter, Guez would run and jump with grace, summoning someone here and there from the spontaneous circle and directing them as if by magic.Straddling the line between improv and comedy, the artist knew how to translate his talents as an entertainer into lessons of civic awareness. An actor, author and director, his work was rooted in medieval mysteries, the commedia dell'arte, Enfants du Paradis (Children of Paradise), and more. A lesson in theater, a bit of group therapy, a rare moment of collective laughter was transformed into civic reflection. At times, it escalated. Guez had indignation on the tip of his tongue, quick to put down social injustice, domination and war, while celebrating nurses, childhood and French public school – all without being bitter or pompous.The method was simple: embarking on a spontaneous adaptation of Les Misérables, he would randomly recruit apprentice actors from the audience. No one ever refused the invitation. There were some inspired Cosettes, some British Jean Valjeans who had to play in French, some uncooperative princes, little boys full of promise, a very determined African in the role of Thénardier, and a lady holding her purse in the role of Madame Thénardier.",Obituaries,born tunis january john gilbert youssef guez known john guez passed away paris wednesday august age handsome face childlike flexibility energy uncanny class john guez street performer entertainer fixture outside centre georges pompidou moment opened regularly posted place edmond michelet pariss arrondissement neighborhood known beaubourg home heyday street theater since living theatre dario guez took art form one greatest peaks artists square called maestro actors michel michael lonsdale among others used slip incognito audience circle sometimes square made ordinary passers tourists foreigners lovers lost souls guez skilled gathering around prop bamboo wand would use summon police sarkozy god guez could spontaneously gather crowd maybe passers get act light colored suit white jacket clothes elegantly rumpled adding spotlessly clean columbo style raincoat winter guez would run jump grace summoning someone spontaneous circle directing magic straddling line improv comedy artist knew translate talents entertainer lessons civic awareness actor author director work rooted medieval mysteries commedia dellarte enfants paradis children paradise lesson theater bit group therapy rare moment collective laughter transformed civic reflection times escalated guez indignation tip tongue quick put social injustice domination war celebrating nurses childhood french public school without bitter pompous method simple embarking spontaneous adaptation les mis rables would randomly recruit apprentice actors audience one ever refused invitation inspired cosettes british jean valjeans play french uncooperative princes little boys full promise determined african role nardier lady holding purse role madame nardier,born tuni januari john gilbert youssef guez known john guez pass away pari wednesday august age handsom face childlik flexibl energi uncanni class john guez street perform entertain fixtur outsid centr georg pompid moment open regularli post place edmond michelet pariss arrondiss neighborhood known beaubourg home heyday street theater sinc live theatr dario guez took art form one greatest peak artist squar call maestro actor michel michael lonsdal among other use slip incognito audienc circl sometim squar made ordinari passer tourist foreign lover lost soul guez skill gather around prop bamboo wand would use summon polic sarkozi god guez could spontan gather crowd mayb passer get act light color suit white jacket cloth elegantli rumpl ad spotlessli clean columbo style raincoat winter guez would run jump grace summon someon spontan circl direct magic straddl line improv comedi artist knew translat talent entertain lesson civic awar actor author director work root mediev mysteri commedia dellart enfant paradi children paradis lesson theater bit group therapi rare moment collect laughter transform civic reflect time escal guez indign tip tongu quick put social injustic domin war celebr nurs childhood french public school without bitter pompou method simpl embark spontan adapt le mi rabl would randomli recruit apprentic actor audienc one ever refus invit inspir cosett british jean valjean play french uncoop princ littl boy full promis determin african role nardier ladi hold purs role madam nardier
"Gilles Perrault, author of 'The Red Sweater', has died aged 92","    The son of members of the French Resistance, the author wrote of hidden lives and secret histories, publishing 50 books, many of which have been translated and adapted for the screen. ","Born in Paris on March 9, 1931, Gilles Perrault (who was born Jacques Peyroles) died on August 3, 2023, in Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, the Normandy village where he chose to live with his second wife in 1961. Sitting between the church and the war memorial, his house, the exterior wall riddled with bullets, became for him a place of remembrance. He loved to walk along the D-Day beaches every day, remembering the heroic moments of June 6, 1944, to which he devoted so many pages – most notably in Le Secret du jour J (The Secrets of D-Day), published in 1964.A popular writer with a lyrical pen and an incisive style, a blend of Norman Mailer and John le Carré, he was the author of some 50 books, some of which were translated worldwide and some which were made into films by Michel Deville, André Téchiné and Jacques Rouffio.Perrault's admiration for his mother, Germaine Merlot-Peyroles, knew no bounds. And with good reason: a left-wing lawyer and Dreyfusist who joined the Resistance with her husband in June 1940, she was one of the Republic's first elected women. Throughout his childhood, the young boy was confronted with the ordeal of a clandestine existence, forced to silently decipher a reality based on the principle of a double life.From this period, he retained not only a taste for secrecy but above all a precocious desire to shed light on subterranean lives, both sublime and abject: those of intelligence and espionage networks. Perrault would always choose his camp: that of the resistance fighters, whatever their moral turpitude, against that of the collaborationists, whatever their art of seduction. In 2014's Dictionnaire amoureux de la Résistance (""Loving Dictionary of the Resistance"") he wrote: ""To join the resistance is to sign up for torture and death. Never has heroism been such a daily occurrence; never has treason spilled so much blood and tears.""Educated at the Collège Stanislas in Paris, then at Sciences Po, he embarked on a career as a lawyer, which he abandoned after five years to make a living from his writing, after enlisting in Algeria in 1955, in the eighth colonial parachute regiment. He recounted this experience in the book that would make him famous, Les Parachutistes (""The Paratroopers""), in 1961, in which he painted a terrible picture of the despair of a generation of soldiers. He came out of it devastated, and solidly anti-colonial.It was the publication of L'Orchestre rouge (The Red Orchestra) in 1967 that made his name. In this rigorously researched bestseller, he recounted the little-known adventure of one of the largest anti-Nazi networks, founded by Leopold Trepper, of strict Soviet allegiance, which rallied Europeans of all nationalities. Most of the 70 members were tortured, deported or executed, including 19 women.",Obituaries,born paris march gilles perrault born jacques peyroles died august sainte marie mont normandy village chose live second wife sitting church war memorial house exterior wall riddled bullets became place remembrance loved walk along day beaches every day remembering heroic moments june devoted many pages notably secret jour secrets day published popular writer lyrical pen incisive style blend norman mailer john carr author books translated worldwide made films michel deville andr chin jacques rouffio perraults admiration mother germaine merlot peyroles knew bounds good reason left wing lawyer dreyfusist joined resistance husband june one republics first elected women throughout childhood young boy confronted ordeal clandestine existence forced silently decipher reality based principle double life period retained taste secrecy precocious desire shed light subterranean lives sublime abject intelligence espionage networks perrault would always choose camp resistance fighters whatever moral turpitude collaborationists whatever art seduction dictionnaire amoureux sistance loving dictionary resistance wrote join resistance sign torture death never heroism daily occurrence never treason spilled much blood tears educated coll stanislas paris sciences embarked career lawyer abandoned five years make living writing enlisting algeria eighth colonial parachute regiment recounted experience book would make famous les parachutistes paratroopers painted terrible despair generation soldiers came devastated solidly anti colonial publication lorchestre rouge red orchestra made name rigorously researched bestseller recounted little known adventure one largest anti nazi networks founded leopold trepper strict soviet allegiance rallied europeans nationalities members tortured deported executed including women,born pari march gill perrault born jacqu peyrol die august saint mari mont normandi villag chose live second wife sit church war memori hous exterior wall riddl bullet becam place remembr love walk along day beach everi day rememb heroic moment june devot mani page notabl secret jour secret day publish popular writer lyric pen incis style blend norman mailer john carr author book translat worldwid made film michel devil andr chin jacqu rouffio perrault admir mother germain merlot peyrol knew bound good reason left wing lawyer dreyfusist join resist husband june one republ first elect women throughout childhood young boy confront ordeal clandestin exist forc silent deciph realiti base principl doubl life period retain tast secreci precoci desir shed light subterranean live sublim abject intellig espionag network perrault would alway choos camp resist fighter whatev moral turpitud collaborationist whatev art seduct dictionnair amoureux sistanc love dictionari resist wrote join resist sign tortur death never heroism daili occurr never treason spill much blood tear educ coll stanisla pari scienc embark career lawyer abandon five year make live write enlist algeria eighth coloni parachut regiment recount experi book would make famou le parachutist paratroop paint terribl despair gener soldier came devast solidli anti coloni public lorchestr roug red orchestra made name rigor research bestsel recount littl known adventur one largest anti nazi network found leopold trepper strict soviet allegi ralli european nation member tortur deport execut includ women
"Federico Bahamontes, winner of the 1959 Tour de France, has died","    The 'Eagle of Toledo,' one of cycling's greatest climbers and the first Spaniard to win the Tour, died on Tuesday, aged 95. ","They say you never forget how to ride a bicycle. Federico Bahamontes put his away for good when he retired from the peloton in 1965. To maintain the legend he built and maintained with great care, the Spaniard swore he'd only ridden once after that. It was a sad day in May 1994, for a final tribute to Luis Ocaña, winner of the Tour de France in 1973.Bahamontes died on Tuesday, August 8 at the age of 95, Toledo mayor Carlos Velasquez announced on social media. Born on July 9, 1928, in Val de Santo Domingo, Toledo province, he joins his compatriot Ocaña but also most of his rivals, friends and enemies, of yesterday: Louison Bobet, Jacques Anquetil, Roger Rivière, Gastone Nencini, Charly Gaul, Raymond Poulidor...Winner of the 1959 Tour de France, ""the Eagle of Toledo"" – as he was described in 1957 by Jacques Goddet, the race's director – was the oldest living Tour winner. He had plenty of time to recount his great victories and defeats with a profusion of details, anecdotes and excuses typical of champions from an era of which little was broadcast on television.""As a tribute to my Tour victory, I was the first to ride my bike on the pitch of the Bernabeu [Real Madrid's stadium],"" he used to say, as if to remind us of his pioneering role. As the first Spanish winner of the Tour, he inspired the Fuente and Ocaña brothers in the 1970s and planted the seed that would later allow the triumphant Spain of Pedro Delgado, Miguel Indurain and Alberto Contador to flourish.If ""Spanish climber"" has long sounded like a tautology, it's because Bahamontes shaped their reputation. As a young cyclist, he owed his qualities to the topography of his city: perched on a hill above the Tagus, the capital of Castilla-La Mancha offered the ideal terrain to develop climbers. Apprenticed in a bicycle repair shop, the teenager began to work his legs by working as a courier for Toledo's shopkeepers. L'Equipe journalist Pierre Chany compared his suppleness to that of a ""flamenco dancer"" when he saw him shimmy his long, lean body up the steep slopes of the Alps and Pyrenees.Bahamontes also lived up to his reputation as a whimsical, even fanciful, rider. During his first Tour de France in 1954, he took the lead at the summit of the Col de Romeyère in the Alps, and took the time to enjoy an ice cream while waiting for his pursuers. No matter how often he insisted that he had allowed himself this ice cream break while waiting for mechanical assistance, the legend settled in.The climber, who loved high gradients, was sublime one day, and quickly resigned the next, lacking interest in the overall race, which demands consistent efforts. He won the mountains classification six times, a record beaten only by Richard Virenque, who won it a seventh time in 2004. The Spaniard's pride took a hit. He said the Frenchman lacked the explosiveness and class of the great mountain conquerers like himself: ""He's no match for me. I hope he doesn't mind, but if he's a climber, I'm Napoleon.""Bahamontes's finest hour on the Tour de France came in 1959. Having finished just short of the podium three years earlier, his hopes were dashed in 1958 after the first stages by a stomach ache he feared was the onset of appendicitis. After recovering, he was nonetheless the only rider to stay in Gaul's wheel in the Alps and win two stages.Before taking the start in Mulhouse at the end of June 1959, Bahamontes, 31, made a vow: he was aiming for yellow, and nothing else. He and Gaul, the two best climbers of their generation, respected each other, even if the Spaniard considered the Luxembourger ""a funny guy who watched couples at the hotel through the keyhole"". Gaul fell behind in the overall standings of the 1959 Tour, but proved a valuable breakaway companion on the 17th stage between Saint-Etienne and Grenoble. Gaul won the stage, Bahamontes took the yellow jersey.In the days that followed, Bahamontes faltered under the threat of Henri Anglade. Fortunately for the Spaniard, the French big shots, Anquetil, Rivière and Bobet, preferred to favor a foreigner rather than see a ""little rider"" from the Centre-Midi regional team triumph in their place.In 1963, the Eagle of Toledo was still flying high, but finished second behind an untouchable Anquetil in the final time trial. The following year, he completed his collection with the only missing place on his list of honours: third.After his career, he became the manager of a bicycle and moped store in Toledo, and enjoyed showing visitors around the museum dedicated to him. In 2009, he led Le Monde journalist Jean-Louis Aragon through the streets of his city where, he said, ""they treat me like a king"".Nostalgia had become a faithful friend. In his memories, the sun burned his body, his hands were placed at the top of the handlebars, so he climbed the Aubisque, the Télégraphe or the Izoard again and again, alone in the lead of course. ""I relive those moments every day,"" he confessed. ""I still get such a thrill out of it all, and following today's races, seeing the places I've been, I get goosebumps and I'm happy."" Today, Spain is less so.",Obituaries,say never forget ride bicycle federico bahamontes put away good retired peloton maintain legend built maintained great care spaniard swore hed ridden sad day may

'Hélène Carrère d'Encausse is something else',"The historian and member of the Académie Française Pascal Ory writes that the institution's long-standing secretary, who died on August 5, transcended her vocation as a historian by successively taking positions of leadership in the two fields that defined her: European politics and the Académie Française.","Hélène Carrère d'Encausse had just turned 94 but the news of her death surprised all of us at the Académie. We thought that age had no hold on this woman of rare elegance who, only a month ago, with her usual smile and firmness, presided over the year's last plenary session at the Académie.A few years ago, when the new perpetual secretary of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, elected for a non-renewable six-year term, came to pay Hélène a courtesy call, she was quick to remind him that, at the Académie Française, one necessarily had a deep understanding of linguistic meaning and that she would take the word ""perpetual"" literally.In the face of such exemplary rigor, we can only admire the life path of the young orphan who knew since 1944 – as Georges Perec (1936-1982), taught us – that history has to be written ""with a big ax."" She had been a young naturalized citizen in 1950, in the ideal position to realize that, at that time, one could not save oneself by being ""stateless"" or ""Russian"" or even ""Georgian."" Survival depended on two concepts: scholarship and France.Indeed, the hard-working historian quickly established herself as a leading authority on Russian and Soviet studies, with some 40 books to her credit, including no fewer than 15 published during her tenure as perpetual secretary. And her bibliography remains significant in terms of substance.Carrère d'Encausse's work witnessed the resurgence of political and geopolitical history under the aegis of two great historians at Sciences Po, René Rémond [1918-2007] and Jean-Baptiste Duroselle [1917-1994]. Her work both followed and inspired a vertiginous historiographical evolution. Starting out as a study of the relationship between Marxism and the Russian world, Carrère d'Encausse's investigation would soon focus on the national question, raising troubling questions in Cold War times.The most important and widely acclaimed work is L'Empire Eclaté (""The Shattered Empire""), published 11 years before the fall of the empire in question. There has since been much debate about the relevance of the proposed analysis. It is a strange debate given that the 1978 book's theses were not contradicted by the result of the economic, social and political schisms that arose from the 1980s onward in Poland, Hungary and the Baltic States, and even more so elsewhere in the 1990s. That was indeed the geopolitical outcome.And so from Le Grand Frère (Big Brother: The Soviet Union and Soviet Europe, 1983) and Le Grand Défi (The Great Challenge: Nationalities & the Bolshevik State, 1987) onward, the author became the historian best placed to analyze nationalism at the foot of the Wall, as she did in La Gloire des Nations (""The Glory of Nations""). From then on, her rereading of the imperial period led her to write Catherine II, Alexander II, Nicholas II and other books that could be received with even more attention as she had established a body of work without seeking recognition as a ""prophet.""",Obituaries,carr dencausse turned news death surprised acad mie thought age hold woman rare elegance month ago usual smile firmness presided years last plenary session acad mie years ago new perpetual secretary acad mie des sciences morales politiques elected non renewable six year term came pay courtesy call quick remind acad mie fran aise one necessarily deep understanding linguistic meaning would take word perpetual literally face exemplary rigor admire life path young orphan knew since georges perec taught history written big young naturalized citizen ideal position realize time one could save oneself stateless russian even georgian survival depended two concepts scholarship france indeed hard working historian quickly established leading authority russian soviet studies books credit including fewer published tenure perpetual secretary bibliography remains significant terms substance carr dencausses work witnessed resurgence political geopolitical history aegis two great historians sciences ren mond jean baptiste duroselle work followed inspired vertiginous historiographical evolution starting study relationship marxism russian world carr dencausses investigation would soon focus national question raising troubling questions cold war times important widely acclaimed work lempire eclat shattered empire published years fall empire question since much debate relevance proposed analysis strange debate given books theses contradicted result economic social political schisms arose onward poland hungary baltic states even elsewhere indeed geopolitical outcome grand big brother soviet union soviet europe grand great challenge nationalities bolshevik state onward author became historian best placed analyze nationalism foot wall gloire des nations glory nations rereading imperial period led write catherine alexander nicholas books could received even attention established body work without seeking recognition prophet,carr dencauss turn news death surpris acad mie thought age hold woman rare eleg month ago usual smile firm presid year last plenari session acad mie year ago new perpetu secretari acad mie de scienc moral politiqu elect non renew six year term came pay courtesi call quick remind acad mie fran ais one necessarili deep understand linguist mean would take word perpetu liter face exemplari rigor admir life path young orphan knew sinc georg perec taught histori written big young natur citizen ideal posit realiz time one could save oneself stateless russian even georgian surviv depend two concept scholarship franc inde hard work historian quickli establish lead author russian soviet studi book credit includ fewer publish tenur perpetu secretari bibliographi remain signific term substanc carr dencauss work wit resurg polit geopolit histori aegi two great historian scienc ren mond jean baptist durosel work follow inspir vertigin historiograph evolut start studi relationship marxism russian world carr dencauss investig would soon focu nation question rais troubl question cold war time import wide acclaim work lempir eclat shatter empir publish year fall empir question sinc much debat relev propos analysi strang debat given book these contradict result econom social polit schism aros onward poland hungari baltic state even elsewher inde geopolit outcom grand big brother soviet union soviet europ grand great challeng nation bolshevik state onward author becam historian best place analyz nation foot wall gloir de nation glori nation reread imperi period led write catherin alexand nichola book could receiv even attent establish bodi work without seek recognit prophet
"Musician Sixto Rodriguez, subject of 'Searching for Sugarman' documentary, dies at 81","    The musician flopped in the United States, but he became a star in South Africa for songs protesting the Vietnam War, racial inequality, abuse of women and social mores. ","Singer and songwriter Sixto Rodriguez, who was the subject of the Oscar-winning documentary Searching for Sugarman, has died. He was 81.Rodriguez's death on Tuesday, August 8, in Detroit was announced on the Sugarman.org website and confirmed Wednesday by his granddaughter, Amanda Kennedy. He died following a short illness, according to his wife, Konny Rodriguez, 72. A 2013 Associated Press story referred to Rodriguez as ""the greatest protest singer and songwriter that most people never heard of.""His albums flopped in the United States in the 1970s, but – unknown to him – he later became a star in South Africa where his songs protesting the Vietnam War, racial inequality, abuse of women and social mores inspired white liberals horrified by the country's brutal racial segregation system of apartheid. Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul's documentary Searching for Sugar Man presented Rodriguez to a much larger audience. The film tells of two South Africans' mission to seek out the fate of their musical hero. It won the Academy Award for best documentary in 2013.Rodriguez was ""more popular than Elvis"" in South Africa, Stephen ""Sugar"" Segerman said in 2013. The Cape Town record store owner's nickname comes from the Rodriguez song ""Sugarman."" As his popularity in South Africa grew, Rodriguez lived in Detroit. But his fans in South Africa believed he also was famous in the United States. They heard stories that the musician had died dramatically: He'd shot himself in the head onstage in Moscow. He'd set himself aflame and burned to death before an audience someplace else. He'd died of a drug overdose. Or he was locked up in a mental institution or incarcerated for murdering his girlfriend.In 1996, Segerman and journalist Carl Bartholomew-Strydom set out to learn the truth. Their efforts led them to Detroit, where they found Rodriguez working on construction sites. ""It's rock-and-roll history now. Who would-a thought?"" Rodriguez told The Associated Press a decade ago. Rodriguez said he just ""went back to work"" after his music career fizzled, raising a family that includes three daughters and launching several unsuccessful campaigns for public office. He made a living through manual labor in Detroit. Still, he never stopped playing his music.""I felt I was ready for the world, but the world wasn't ready for me,"" Rodriguez said. ""I feel we all have a mission – we have obligations. Those turns on the journey, different twists – life is not linear.""Konny Rodriguez said the couple met in 1972 while both were students at Wayne State University in Detroit and married in the early 1980s. Although still married at the time of his death, the couple had been separated for a number of years, she said Wednesday while shuffling through some of Sixto Rodriguez's memorabilia.""He loved college. He was born to be taught, to teach himself,"" Konny Rodriguez said. ""The music was more to bring people together. He would play anywhere, anytime. That's where I noticed him. He was walking down Cass Avenue with a guitar and a black bag. He was a really eccentric guy.""The two albums she said he recorded in 1969 and 1971 ""didn't do well."" Rodriguez added, ""I'm sure that was still in his head. Then in 1979, I picked up the phone and it was a guy with an Australian accent who said, 'He must come to Australia because he's very famous here.'""She said they toured Australia in 1979 and 1981 and later learned about the impact of his music in South Africa: ""Apartheid was going on. Frank Sinatra had a full-page ad, 'Do not go to South Africa.' We didn't.""After the end of apartheid, Sixto Rodriguez did travel to South Africa and perform in front of his fans there, she said. Sixto Rodriguez later pursued royalties he did not receive from his music being used and played in South Africa. Some of Rodriguez's songs were banned by the apartheid regime and many bootlegged copies were made on tapes and later CDs.",Obituaries,singer songwriter sixto rodriguez subject oscar winning

"Sinead O'Connor, singer of despair and revolt, has died","    The Irish musician died on Wednesday at age 56. Known for the global hit 'Nothing Compares 2 U,' released in 1990, she caused a scandal by tearing up a photo of Pope John Paul II live on television. ","Irish singer Sinead O'Connor passed away at the age of 56 on Wednesday, July 26. With her repeated outbursts, she held an incomparable place in the music scene, from which she twice announced her retirement before changing her mind in 2003 and again in 2021. She was best known for her version of ""Nothing Compares 2 U,"" a song composed by Prince that became the biggest hit of 1990. According to the Dublin daily The Irish Times, neither the place nor the circumstances of her death were specified in a statement from her family, who have requested ""privacy at this very difficult time.""Since the suicide of her 17-year-old son in January 2022, O'Connor's life had been nothing but misery. Having tweeted that she no longer wanted to live, she was hospitalized at her own request. The tragedy put an end to a planned tour and postponed indefinitely the release of her 11th studio album, No Veteran Dies Alone.O'Connor, whose frankness was as disarming as it was uncomfortable, seemed inseparable from pain, even in her peak years. The video for ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" introduced the world to her beautiful green eyes; her short, shaved hair; and her powerful, heart-wrenching voice. There is a still shot of her walking alone in Parc de Saint-Cloud, near Paris. As French poet Alfred de Musset wrote, ""The most despairing songs are the most beautiful,"" and this one is a pure tear-jerker, which she lets flow in the last verse. Her love has left her, and ""all flowers in the backyard that you planted, mama, all died when you went away."" This sentence was addressed to her mother, who had died five years earlier in a car accident.Prince wrote this lachrymose ballad for his side project, The Family. She seemed to be the only one to notice it in 1985. With this single, O'Connor ensured the success of her second album, the 7-million-unit-selling I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, in which, as playful as ever, she covered a translation of a 17th-century Irish poem, ""I Am Stretched on Your Grave."" The song is sung over the top of a rhythmic loop based on James Brown's ""Funky Drummer,"" which is probably the most sampled track in history. Having become a star, she would now work hard to break free of this new status.O'Connor was born in Dublin on December 8, 1966, to parents she claims abused her as a child. She was sent to a Magdalene laundry for her truancy and kleptomania at the age of 15. This sinister Irish institution was designed to put ""lost girls"" back on the straight and narrow. She found the experience horrifying.",Obituaries,irish singer sinead oconnor passed away age wednesday july repeated outbursts held incomparable place music scene twice announced retirement changing mind best known version nothing compares song composed prince became biggest hit according dublin daily irish times neither place circumstances death specified statement family requested privacy difficult time since suicide year old son january oconnors life nothing misery tweeted longer wanted live hospitalized request tragedy put end planned tour postponed indefinitely release studio album veteran dies alone oconnor whose frankness disarming uncomfortable seemed inseparable pain even peak years video nothing compares introduced world beautiful green eyes short shaved hair powerful heart wrenching voice still shot walking alone parc saint cloud near paris french poet alfred musset wrote despairing songs beautiful one pure tear jerker lets flow last verse love left flowers backyard planted mama died went away sentence addressed mother died five years earlier car accident prince wrote lachrymose ballad side project family seemed one notice single oconnor ensured success second album million unit selling want havent got playful ever covered translation century irish poem stretched grave song sung top rhythmic loop based james browns funky drummer probably sampled track history become star would work hard break free new status oconnor born dublin december parents claims abused child sent magdalene laundry truancy kleptomania age sinister irish institution designed put lost girls back straight narrow found experience horrifying,irish singer sinead oconnor pass away age wednesday juli repeat outburst held incompar place music scene twice announc retir chang mind best known version noth compar song compos princ becam biggest hit accord dublin daili irish time neither place circumst death specifi statement famili request privaci difficult time sinc suicid year old son januari oconnor life noth miseri tweet longer want live hospit request tragedi put end plan tour postpon indefinit releas studio album veteran die alon oconnor whose frank disarm uncomfort seem insepar pain even peak year video noth compar introduc world beauti green eye short shave hair power heart wrench voic still shot walk alon parc saint cloud near pari french poet alfr musset wrote despair song beauti one pure tear jerker let flow last vers love left flower backyard plant mama die went away sentenc address mother die five year earlier car accid princ wrote lachrymos ballad side project famili seem one notic singl oconnor ensur success second album million unit sell want havent got play ever cover translat centuri irish poem stretch grave song sung top rhythmic loop base jame brown funki drummer probabl sampl track histori becom star would work hard break free new statu oconnor born dublin decemb parent claim abus child sent magdalen laundri truanci kleptomania age sinist irish institut design put lost girl back straight narrow found experi horrifi
"Robbie Robertson, iconic songwriter and guitarist of The Band, dies at 80","    From collaborating with Bob Dylan to crafting timeless rock classics, the Canadian-born musician helped reshape American music. ","Robbie Robertson, guitarist and main songwriter of the seminal rock group The Band, has died, the trade publication Variety said Wednesday, August 9, citing his manager. He was 80 years old.As the ringleader of the Canadian-American group, Robertson penned The Band's most iconic songs including ""The Weight,"" ""The Night They Drove Ol' Dixie Down"" and ""Up On Cripple Creek.""His manager said he was surrounded by family at the time of his death, without citing a cause.Prior to his work and leadership with The Band, Robertson was a key collaborator with none other than Bob Dylan, touring with him and playing on the album ""Blonde on Blonde.""Born July 5, 1943, in Toronto, Canada to a Native American mother, Robertson worked on traveling carnivals in his early teenage years, before joining, and starting, a variety of bands. ""I've been playing guitar for so long I can't remember when I started,"" he told Rolling Stone magazine in 1968. ""I guess I got into rock and roll like everybody else.""He joined the backing band of Ronnie Hawkins, a rockabilly star, when he was just 16, where he eventually met fellow musicians Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Levon Helm.The group formed a strong bond, and they became Dylan's backing band in the mid-1960s for his infamous first electric tour. They also played with the icon on his much-bootlegged ""basement tapes.""After several name changes, the musicians became known as The Band. Robertson's history-minded compositions were masterful yarns that evoked the wilds of America and the characters who colored them, and in particular, focused on the American South.""The Weight"" is a regular on all-time greatest songs lists – a folk tune with country and gospel elements as well as Biblical allusion, it's considered a classic of the American songbook. The group played Woodstock and cut a string of albums including ""Music from Big Pink,"" ""The Band"" and ""Cahoots.""The Band split up in 1976 with a farewell concert in San Francisco, immortalized on film by director Martin Scorsese in ""The Last Waltz."" The film, theatrically released in 1978, has become known as a critically acclaimed pioneering rock documentary.It also ushered in Robertson's longtime collaboration and friendship with Scorsese, who hired the guitarist as a musical supervisor on a string of his films including ""Casino"" and ""Gangs of New York.""Robertson didn't tour again after ""The Last Waltz"" but did release a string of solo albums starting in 1987, when he dropped ""Robbie Robertson."" He remained a beloved figure of American rock and folk, both for his guitar chops and his poetry.""I thought of a couple of words that led to a couple more,"" he told Rolling Stone in 1969, asked how he penned the classic ""The Weight."" ""The next thing I know I wrote the song,"" Robertson continued. ""We just figured it was a simple song, and when it came up we gave it a try and recorded it three or four times.""

"Robbie Robertson, founder of 'The Band' and road companion of Bob Dylan","    With his band, the guitarist crafted albums that left a significant impact on his peers during the 1960s, eventually forging an unbreakable connection with Martin Scorsese. ","On the big screen, he was the star of The Last Waltz (1978), Martin Scorsese's documentary on The Band's false farewell, often cited as the finest rock concert ever filmed. And before that, the principal composer of a neo-traditionalist quintet of American music, a fellow traveler with Bob Dylan, whose first two albums exerted a major influence on his contemporaries in the late 1960s. Canadian guitarist Robbie Robertson died on Wednesday, August 9, in Los Angeles at the age of 80. His family has asked those wishing to express their grief to make donations to the Six Nations Indian Reserve in Grand River, Ontario, for the construction of a cultural center. It was here that Robertson, of Iroquois descent through his mother, learned to play the guitar from family members.Born in Toronto on July 5, 1943, Jaime Royal Robertson was hooked on rhythm'n'blues and its extension, rock'n'roll, as a pre-teen. At the age of 16, he was spotted by Ronnie Hawkins, a US singer from Arkansas with a career in Ontario. His group, The Hawks, would gradually bring together future members of The Band: drummer Levon Helm (also from Arkansas) and three other Canadians, bassist Rick Danko, pianist Richard Manuel and organist Garth Hudson, now the last surviving member.From 1964 onwards, the five musicians became independent under the name Levon and the Hawks and were then recruited by Bob Dylan for a tour of the United States beginning in the autumn of 1965. The second half of the concerts, electric (literally and figuratively), provoked a wrath amongst folk fans, who saw it as a betrayal of their idol. The hostility from of some of the public was even more vociferous in the UK, when the band was without Helm, who had decided to throw in the towel. The episode toughened them up, but they were happy to see the back of it in May 1966. In July, Dylan suffered a mysterious motorcycle accident and retired from the stage for almost eight years. He made his comeback with The Band in 1974, on a triumphant North American tour.Robertson, who took part in the recording of the master's masterpiece Blonde on Blonde, reunited with Dylan and his bandmates in 1967 in the Catskill Mountains, New York. The star took a break in the country at Woodstock. Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson rented a house in the vicinity nicknamed ""Big Pink."" Every day, they gathered there to record music using rudimentary technology. The result was a hundred or so songs, creations, traditional songs, folk, blues and country classics. Helm, who was working on oil rigs in New Orleans, rejoined the group. These recordings, which generated huge sums of money on the pirate market, were officially released in 1975 under the title The Basement Tapes.",Obituaries,big screen star last waltz martin scorseses documentary bands false farewell often cited finest rock concert ever filmed principal composer neo traditionalist quintet american music fellow traveler bob dylan whose first two albums exerted major influence contemporaries late canadian guitarist robbie robertson died wednesday august los angeles age family asked wishing express grief make donations six nations indian reserve grand river ontario construction cultural center robertson iroquois descent mother learned play guitar family members born toronto july jaime royal robertson hooked rhythmnblues extension rocknroll pre teen age spotted ronnie hawkins singer arkansas career ontario group hawks would gradually bring together future members band drummer levon helm also arkansas three canadians bassist rick danko pianist richard manuel organist garth hudson last surviving member onwards five musicians became independent name levon hawks recruited bob dylan tour united states beginning autumn second half concerts electric literally figuratively provoked wrath amongst folk fans saw betrayal idol hostility public even vociferous band without helm decided throw towel episode toughened happy see back may july dylan suffered mysterious motorcycle accident retired stage almost eight years made comeback band triumphant north american tour robertson took part recording masters masterpiece blonde blonde reunited dylan bandmates catskill mountains new york star took break country woodstock rick danko richard manuel garth hudson rented house vicinity nicknamed big pink every day gathered record music using rudimentary technology result hundred songs creations traditional songs folk blues country classics helm working oil rigs new orleans rejoined group recordings generated huge sums money pirate market officially released title basement tapes,big screen star last waltz martin scorses documentari band fals farewel often cite finest rock concert ever film princip compos neo traditionalist quintet american music fellow travel bob dylan whose first two album exert major influenc contemporari late canadian guitarist robbi robertson die wednesday august lo angel age famili ask wish express grief make donat six nation indian reserv grand river ontario construct cultur center robertson iroquoi descent mother learn play guitar famili member born toronto juli jaim royal robertson hook rhythmnblu extens rocknrol pre teen age spot ronni hawkin singer arkansa career ontario group hawk would gradual bring togeth futur member band drummer levon helm also arkansa three canadian bassist rick danko pianist richard manuel organist garth hudson last surviv member onward five musician becam independ name levon hawk recruit bob dylan tour unit state begin autumn second half concert electr liter figur provok wrath amongst folk fan saw betray idol hostil public even vocifer band without helm decid throw towel episod toughen happi see back may juli dylan suffer mysteri motorcycl accid retir stage almost eight year made comeback band triumphant north american tour robertson took part record master masterpiec blond blond reunit dylan bandmat catskil mountain new york star took break countri woodstock rick danko richard manuel garth hudson rent hous vicin nicknam big pink everi day gather record music use rudimentari technolog result hundr song creation tradit song folk blue countri classic helm work oil rig new orlean rejoin group record gener huge sum money pirat market offici releas titl basement tape
"Sixto Rodriguez, enigmatic singer-songwriter, has died","    Brought out of relative obscurity in 2012 by the documentary 'Searching for Sugar Man', the American singer-songwriter passed away at 81 years old. ","After a short musical career out of the spotlight from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, the documentary film Searching for Sugar Man, by Swedish director Malik Bendjelloul (1977-2014) brought him into the spotlight. The film was presented at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2012. Singer, guitarist and songwriter Sixto Rodriguez died on Tuesday, August 8, at the age of 81. His website Sugarman.org announced his death without any further details.By the time the film started being shown at film festivals and receiving several awards including the Oscar for Best Documentary Film, Rodriguez had already been rediscovered by a core group of fans. This was thanks to the careful re-release of his two albums Cold Fact (1970) and Coming From Reality (1971) by the American record company Light in the Attic Records in 2008 and 2009. He was the subject of a number of articles and gave a few concerts in the USA. In France, he performed at the pioneering Transmusicales de Rennes festival in December 2009. We have a slightly distant personal memory of the performance that left us a little skeptical.Born on July 10, 1942, in Detroit, Michigan, Sixto Diaz Rodriguez was raised in a working-class environment. His father arrived from Mexico in the 1920s to work in the city’s car factories and his mother was Native American. She died when Rodriguez was 3. He learned a few guitar chords, started singing around the age of 20, and survived by doing odd jobs. Vision problems forced him to wear dark glasses at an early age. In 1967, he recorded his first 45-rpm single, a little folk with an organ background.He continued to play in clubs, and in the summer of 1969 recorded a dozen songs in the studio. These songs would be on his first album, Cold Fact, released in March 1970 by the Sussex record company. The album’s sleeve shows only his last name, Rodriguez. The album begins with the song Sugar Man, probably his best-known song today. He has a soft voice with a slight drawl and a nasal quality reminiscent of Bob Dylan. He has an expressive energy too, at times, like Richie Havens (one of the heroes of Woodstock with his interpretation of Freedom). There are some slightly psychedelic arrangements in places, strings and wind instruments, with Mike Theodore and Dennis Coffey as producers, who regularly work for the soul label Motown Records.The album went unnoticed.

British 'chat show king' Michael Parkinson dies aged 88,    The veteran TV host's career spanned seven decades and he interviewed the world's biggest stars on his long-running chat show. ,"Michael Parkinson, the veteran British chat show host whose decades-spanning career featured interviews with some of the world's highest-profile figures, has died at the age of 88, his family said on Thursday, August 17.His BBC show ""Parkinson"" which first aired in June 1971 made him a household name. He died late on Wednesday following a brief illness.Muhammad Ali, Fred Astaire, Elton John, Paul McCartney and Peter Sellers were just a few of the famous names to grace his interview couch. Others included Lauren Bacall, David Bowie, Tom Cruise, Helen Mirren and Gwyneth Paltrow.""Sir Michael Parkinson passed away peacefully at home last night in the company of his family,"" his family said in a statement, requesting ""privacy and time to grieve.""The star interviewer's BBC chat show enjoyed a successful run until 1982 before being revived in 1998. He switched from the BBC to commercial rival ITV in 2004, where he continued until 2007.Parkinson's final two-hour show in late 2007 featured a typically star-studded line-up of footballer David Beckham, actors Michael Caine and Judy Dench, environmental broadcaster David Attenborough and comedian Billy Connolly.Parkinson was knighted by the late Queen at Buckingham Palace in 2008. ""I never expected to be knighted – I thought there was more chance of me turning into a Martian really,"" said the broadcaster who grew up the son of a miner in a working class community in northern England.Prior to taking to the airwaves, he worked as a newspaper journalist, work that he credited with honing his interview skills.In 2013, he revealed he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer following a routine health check. He had three sons with his wife Mary, who he married in 1959.Tributes quickly flooded in for the British TV legend, with the director-general of the BBC lauding him as ""the king of the chat show"" and an ""incredible broadcaster and journalist.""It will re-air a celebration program about Parkinson on Thursday evening. Comedian Stephen Fry praised his authenticity. ""The genius of Parky was that unlike most people (and most of his guests, me included) he was always 100 percent himself. On camera and off,"" he said on Instagram.A long-time newspaper sports columnist and cricket enthusiast, Parkinson was also lauded by celebrated former umpire Dickie Bird, who had spoken to his ""true friend"" by phone just hours before he died. ""I'm completely stunned and shocked,"" Bird told Times Radio. ""There'll never be another one like him...

"Clarence Avant, 'Black Godfather' of music, and benefactor of athletes and politicians, dies aged 92","    Avant, the manager, entrepreneur, facilitator and adviser who helped launch or guide the careers of Quincy Jones, Bill Withers and many others and came to be known as 'The Godfather of Black Music,' has died. He was 92. ","Clarence Avant, the judicious manager, entrepreneur, facilitator and adviser who helped launch or guide the careers of Quincy Jones, Bill Withers and many others and came to be known as the ""Black Godfather"" of music and beyond, has died. He was 92.Avant, inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, died on Sunday, August 14, at his home in Los Angeles, according to a family statement released Monday.""Clarence leaves behind a loving family and a sea of friends and associates that have changed the world and will continue to change the world for generations to come. The joy of his legacy eases the sorrow of our loss,"" said the statement, which was released by Avant's son Alex, daughter Nicole and her husband, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos.Avant’s achievements were both public and behind the scenes, as a name in the credits, or a name behind the names. Born in a segregated hospital in North Carolina, he became a man of lasting and wide-ranging influence, in part by minding two pieces of advice from an early mentor, the music manager Joe Glaser: Never let on how much you know, and ask for as much money as possible, ""without stuttering.""Born in 1931, Clarence Avant spent his early years in Greensboro, North Carolina, one of eight children raised by a single mother, and he dropped out of high school to move north. A friend from North Carolina helped him find work managing a lounge in Newark, New Jersey, and he soon got to know Glaser, whose clients ranged from Louis Armstrong to Barbra Streisand, not to mention Al Capone. Through Glaser, Avant found himself in places where Black people rarely had been permitted.As he rose in the entertainment industry, Avant became more active politically. He was an early supporter of Tom Bradley, the first Black mayor of Los Angeles, and served as executive producer of Save the Children, a 1973 documentary about a concert fundraiser for the Reverend Jesse Jackson’s Operation PUSH. Three years earlier, when he learned that the civil rights leader Andrew Young was running for Congress, in Georgia, he gave him a call.Sometimes called ""The Godfather of Black Music,"" he broke in as a manager in the 1950s, with such clients as singers Sarah Vaughan and Little Willie John and composer Lalo Schifrin, who wrote the theme to Mission: Impossible. In the 1970s he was an early patron of Black-owned radio stations and, in the 1990s, headed Motown after founder Berry Gordy Jr. sold the company.He also started such labels as Sussex (a hybrid of two Avant passions – success and sex) and Tabu, with artists including Withers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the SOS Band and an obscure singer-songwriter, Sixto Rodriquez, who decades later became famous through the Oscar-winning documentary Searching for Sugarman.Other work took place more quietly. Avant brokered the sale of Stax Records to Gulf and Western in 1968, after being recruited by Stax executive Al Bell as a bridge between the entertainment and business industries. He raised money for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, helped Michael Jackson organize his first solo tour and advised Narada Michael Walden, LA Reid and Babyface and other younger admirers.""Everyone in this business has been by Clarence’s desk, if they’re smart,"" Quincy Jones liked to say of him.Avant’s influence extended to sports. He helped running back Jim Brown transition from football to acting and produced a primetime television special for Muhammad Ali. When baseball great Henry Aaron was on the verge of surpassing Babe Ruth as the game’s home run champion, in 1974, Avant made sure that Aaron received the kind of lucrative commercial deals often elusive for Black athletes, starting with a personal demand to the president of Coca-Cola. Aaron would later tell The Undefeated that everything he had become was ""because of Clarence Avant.""Avant met Jacqueline Gray, a model at the time, at an Ebony Fashion Fair in mid-1960s and married her in 1967. They had two children: Music producer-manager Alexander Devore and Nicole Avant, the former US ambassador to the Bahamas and, along with Sarandos, a major fundraiser for Obama.

"Pierre Alferi, a singular writer, has died","    The writer and poet, who was the eldest son of philosopher Jacques Derrida, and authored a wide range of works including collections, novels and essays, died in Paris on August 16, aged 60. ","The news of Pierre Alferi's death in Paris on Wednesday, August 16, at the age of 60, immediately triggered the intense, almost selfish sadness of losing a marvelous writer. He was a wonderfully idiosyncratic and surprisingly multi-faceted author, whose books, like his many other works, were a regular and somewhat mischievous addition to a body of work that was always in motion – vibrant to the extreme, at the crossroads of poetry, the novel, cinema, music, philosophy, the visual arts and even, one might say, science and technology.Now sealed by death, this work nevertheless remains open, available for future readings, of which there will certainly be many. It is the product of a philosopher by training, himself the child of a philosopher, Alferi being the eldest son of Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) and psychoanalyst and translator Marguerite Aucouturier (1932-2020). He studied at the École Normale Supérieure on rue d'Ulm, passed the agrégation, which is the French civil service exam, and then, under the supervision of Louis Marin, wrote a thesis on the medieval thinker and theologian William of Ockham (c. 1285-1349), which he would shortly publish as his first book, Guillaume d'Ockham le singulier (Minuit, 1989).Discreet about his ancestry, adopting his maternal grandmother's name for public life, Alferi was no less loyal to a certain spirit of Derrida, to whom he pays a discreet tribute in his last published book, Divers chaos (P.O.L, 2020): ""I haven't forgotten my father's postcard"" (allusion to Jacques Derrida's famous book, The Post Card. From Socrates to Freud and Beyond, Aubier-Flammarion, 1980). He has the same philosophical curiosity, a manifest taste for speculative play and a rigorous attention to objects that may turn out to be unexpected, as well as a formidable flair for titles: Kub Or; Fmn; Sentimentale journée; Après vous; Kiwi (1994; 1994; 1997; 2010; 2012, all published by P.O.L), or Le Cinéma des familles, a novel that joyfully reinvents the autobiographical genre by imagining a child's filmed account, from an early age, of ""Mompère"" and ""Mammère"" (P.O.L, 1999).Initially a poet, who published a number of collections and essays starting in the 1990s, Alferi soon showed a penchant for collaborative creation and personal friendship. He collaborated (under the name Thomas Lago) with musician and Kat Onoma singer Rodolphe Burger, who remained one of his favorite accomplices, from the creation in the early 2000s of Cinépoèmes et films parlants, until their revival on various French stages last spring. He worked with sculptor Jacques Julien, wrote an album with Jeanne Balibar (Paramour, 2003), participated in the creation of shows with choreographer Fanny de Chaillé, hosted the magazine Détail with photographer Suzanne Doppelt, and in 1995 and 1996, together with Olivier Cadiot, edited the two issues of a publication that it would be no exaggeration to describe as historic: the Revue de littérature générale, which can be read as a summary of poetic creation for the transition to the next century. He was also a translator (of John Donne, Giorgio Agamben, John Ashbery...) and a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris.",Obituaries,news pierre alferis death paris wednesday august age immediately triggered intense almost selfish sadness losing marvelous writer wonderfully idiosyncratic surprisingly multi faceted author whose books like many works regular somewhat mischievous addition body work always motion vibrant extreme crossroads poetry novel cinema music philosophy visual arts even one might say science technology sealed death work nevertheless remains open available future readings certainly many product philosopher training child philosopher alferi eldest son jacques derrida psychoanalyst translator marguerite aucouturier studied cole normale sup rieure rue dulm passed agr gation french civil service exam supervision louis marin wrote thesis medieval thinker theologian william ockham would shortly publish first book guillaume dockham singulier minuit discreet ancestry adopting maternal grandmothers name public life alferi less loyal certain spirit derrida pays discreet tribute last published book divers chaos havent forgotten fathers postcard allusion jacques derridas famous book post card socrates freud beyond aubier flammarion philosophical curiosity manifest taste speculative play rigorous attention objects may turn unexpected well formidable flair titles kub fmn sentimentale journ apr vous kiwi published cin des familles novel joyfully reinvents autobiographical genre imagining childs filmed account early age momp mamm initially poet published number collections essays starting alferi soon showed penchant collaborative creation personal friendship collaborated name thomas lago musician kat onoma singer rodolphe burger remained one favorite accomplices creation early cin mes films parlants revival various french stages last spring worked sculptor jacques julien wrote album jeanne balibar paramour participated creation shows choreographer fanny chaill hosted magazine tail photographer suzanne doppelt together olivier cadiot edited two issues publication would exaggeration describe historic revue litt rature rale read summary poetic creation transition next century also translator john donne giorgio agamben john ashbery professor cole des beaux arts paris,news pierr alferi death pari wednesday august age immedi trigger intens almost selfish sad lose marvel writer wonder idiosyncrat surprisingli multi facet author whose book like mani work regular somewhat mischiev addit bodi work alway motion vibrant extrem crossroad poetri novel cinema music philosophi visual art even one might say scienc technolog seal death work nevertheless remain open avail futur read certainli mani product philosoph train child philosoph alferi eldest son jacqu derrida psychoanalyst translat marguerit aucouturi studi cole normal sup rieur rue dulm pass agr gation french civil servic exam supervis loui marin wrote thesi mediev thinker theologian william ockham would shortli publish first book guillaum dockham singuli minuit discreet ancestri adopt matern grandmoth name public life alferi less loyal certain spirit derrida pay discreet tribut last publish book diver chao havent forgotten father postcard allus jacqu derrida famou book post card socrat freud beyond aubier flammarion philosoph curios manifest tast specul play rigor attent object may turn unexpect well formid flair titl kub fmn sentimental journ apr vou kiwi publish cin de famil novel joy reinvent autobiograph genr imagin child film account earli age momp mamm initi poet publish number collect essay start alferi soon show penchant collabor creation person friendship collabor name thoma lago musician kat onoma singer rodolph burger remain one favorit accomplic creation earli cin me film parlant reviv variou french stage last spring work sculptor jacqu julien wrote album jeann balibar paramour particip creation show choreograph fanni chaill host magazin tail photograph suzann doppelt togeth olivi cadiot edit two issu public would exagger describ histor revu litt ratur rale read summari poetic creation transit next centuri also translat john donn giorgio agamben john ashberi professor cole de beaux art pari
"Jean-Louis Georgelin, general in charge of rebuilding Notre-Dame de Paris, has died","    The former army chief of staff died while hiking in the mountains, a year before the end of the mission entrusted to him by Emmanuel Macron. He was 74 years old. ","The last time we see Jean-Louis Georgelin, he was spiritedly climbing the stairs to the construction platform behind Notre-Dame de Paris. Georgelin was speaking loudly, as was his custom – shouting would probably be the right word – with a smile dancing on his lips. ""You saw the flying buttress there, ah yes... The hardest thing about this type of project is managing the schedule.""Ever since French President Emmanuel Macron entrusted him with the mission – in the aftermath of the fire that took place on April 15, 2019 – the reconstruction of the cathedral had been his prime focus. The shaky edifice now rested on his shoulders, as the retired Chief of Staff of the French Armed Forces, with his reputation as a braggart, a man suspicious of technocracy but entirely at ease in its mysteries. ""Isn't this mess beautiful?"" he asked. ""Yes, it's beautiful,"" we answered, and this became our last image of him, avidly watching the scaffolding of the spire being put into place.On Friday, August 18, in Ariège, on the slopes of Mont Valier, Genera Georgelin died as he lived, walking fast and strong during one of the solitary hikes he was still fond of at the age of 74 in the Pyrénées. ""Investigations have established that his death was the result of a major fall during the descent, at around 8 pm, on a particularly steep rocky passage"", the prosecutor's office said on Saturday evening.Aspet, in the former Comminges region, is just over an hour's drive away, this is where the general, a practicing Catholic, was born on August 30, 1948. His maternal grandparents ran a grocery store in the village of 800 inhabitants. His father was a soldier in Indochina and Algeria. During the period of the war in Indochina, his mother lived ""secluded"" here with her three children. His father ended up as a captain.Their son studied at École Spéciale Militaire Saint-Cyr, with a focus on science, while in Paris others were building barricades, before choosing the infantry. ""I'm an infantryman. Walking makes you think,"" he insisted the first time we met him, to illustrate the fact that he went to the Notre-Dame construction site on foot. For the son of a lower ranking officer to become a five-star general is rare enough to merit a mention. Within the army, Georgelin was a child of social climbing – to the highest level.After working as Jacques Chirac's private chief of staff at the Elysée Palace, he served as Army chief of staff until 2010, before becoming Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honor. In this role, he rubbed shoulders with François Hollande. He also became embroiled in a controversy with Aurélie Filippetti when he first refused to award the Légion d'honneur to Bob Dylan, before relenting. ""As a result, I studied him a lot,"" he remembered, amused. ""I discovered his extraordinary popularity, and that he was shortlisted for the Nobel Prize for literature."" Then there's Nicolas Sarkozy, who is said to have just criticized him for singing too loudly at mass. ""People aren't aware of their own voice,"" he apologized. ""But yes, it's true, I love singing in church.""",Obituaries,last time see jean louis georgelin spiritedly climbing stairs construction platform behind notre dame paris georgelin speaking loudly custom shouting would probably right word smile dancing lips saw flying buttress yes hardest thing type project managing schedule ever since french president emmanuel macron entrusted mission aftermath fire took place april reconstruction cathedral prime focus shaky edifice rested shoulders retired chief staff french armed forces reputation braggart man sus technocracy entirely ease mysteries isnt mess beautiful asked yes beautiful answered became last image avidly watching scaffolding spire put place friday august ari slopes mont valier genera georgelin died lived walking fast strong one solitary hikes still fond age pyr investigations established death result major fall descent around particularly steep rocky passage prosecutors office said saturday evening aspet former comminges region hours drive away general practicing catholic born august maternal grandparents ran grocery store village inhabitants father soldier indochina algeria period war indochina mother lived secluded three children father ended captain son studied cole ciale militaire saint cyr focus science paris others building barricades choosing infantry infantryman walking makes think insisted first time met illustrate fact went notre dame construction site foot son lower ranking officer become five star general rare enough merit mention within army georgelin child social climbing highest level working jacques chiracs private chief staff elys palace served army chief staff becoming grand chancellor legion honor role rubbed shoulders fran ois hollande also became embroiled controversy aur lie filippetti first refused award gion dhonneur bob dylan relenting result studied lot remembered amused discovered extraordinary popularity shortlisted nobel prize literature theres nicolas sarkozy said criticized singing loudly mass people arent aware voice apologized yes true love singing church,last time see jean loui georgelin spiritedli climb stair construct platform behind notr dame pari georgelin speak loudli custom shout would probabl right word smile danc lip saw fli buttress ye hardest thing type project manag schedul ever sinc french presid emmanuel macron entrust mission aftermath fire took place april reconstruct cathedr prime focu shaki edific rest shoulder retir chief staff french arm forc reput braggart man su technocraci entir eas mysteri isnt mess beauti ask ye beauti answer becam last imag avidli watch scaffold spire put place friday august ari slope mont valier genera georgelin die live walk fast strong one solitari hike still fond age pyr investig establish death result major fall descent around particularli steep rocki passag prosecutor offic said saturday even aspet former comming region hour drive away gener practic cathol born august matern grandpar ran groceri store villag inhabit father soldier indochina algeria period war indochina mother live seclud three children father end captain son studi cole cial militair saint cyr focu scienc pari other build barricad choos infantri infantryman walk make think insist first time met illustr fact went notr dame construct site foot son lower rank offic becom five star gener rare enough merit mention within armi georgelin child social climb highest level work jacqu chirac privat chief staff eli palac serv armi chief staff becom grand chancellor legion honor role rub shoulder fran oi holland also becam embroil controversi aur lie filippetti first refus award gion dhonneur bob dylan relent result studi lot rememb amus discov extraordinari popular shortlist nobel prize literatur there nicola sarkozi said critic sing loudli mass peopl arent awar voic apolog ye true love sing church
"Ron Cephas-Jones, 'This Is Us' actor, dead at 66",    Jones had a double lung transplant in 2020 because of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and spent nearly two months in a Los Angeles hospital. ,"Ron Cephas Jones, a veteran stage actor who won two Emmy Awards for his role as a long-lost father who finds redemption on the NBC television drama series This Is Us, has died at age 66, a representative said on Saturday, August 19. Jones' manager, Dan Spilo, said in an emailed statement the actor died ""due to a long-standing pulmonary issue."" ""Throughout the course of his career, his warmth, beauty, generosity, kindness and heart were felt by anyone who had the good fortune of knowing him,"" Spilo said.On This Is Us, Jones played William ""Shakespeare"" Hill, a biological father whose life is renewed through his relationship with the family of his son Randall Pearson, played by Sterling K. Brown. ""One of the most wonderful people the world has ever seen is no longer with us,"" Brown said in an Instagram post after Jones' death. ""The world is a little less bright. Brother, you are loved. And you will be missed.""Jones won Emmys for best guest actor in a drama series in 2018 and 2020 and was nominated for two more.""Ron was the best of the best – on-screen, on stage, and in real life,"" This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman said on X (the social media site formerly known as Twitter). ""My God: What an actor. I don’t think I ever changed a single take of his in a cut because everything he did was perfect.""Jones spent most of his career in the theater before and after This Is Us, returning to Broadway even after his transplant forced him to learn to breathe and walk again. ""My whole life has been the stage,"" Jones said in a late 2021 interview with the The New York Times , in which he revealed he had quietly been suffering from respiratory problems since about the time he began on This Is Us. ""The idea of not performing again seemed worse to me than death,"" Jones said.He was nominated for a Tony Award and won a 2022 Drama Desk Award for the Broadway role of a truck-stop cook in playwright Lynn Nottage's Clyde's.A native of Paterson, New Jersey, Jones graduated from nearby Ramapo College, where he had intended to study jazz but switched to theater during his sophomore year. He spent the late 1970s and early 1980s traveling the country, working as a bus driver in Southern California for several years.In the mid-1980s he moved to New York, where his career got a jumpstart when he began hanging out and collaborating at the Nuyorican Poets Café, a vital creative hub for poetry, hip-hop, and the performing arts. He would spend the ensuing decades constantly in the theater, often in Off-Broadway plays in New York, including a title turn as Shakespeare's ""Richard III"" at The Public Theater, and in roles with the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago.Jones also had TV guest stints on Mr. Robot, Luke Cage and Lisey's Story.

French economist and exceptional professor Daniel Cohen dies,"    One of France's most respected and instructive economists passed away on Sunday at the age of 70. A professor at the École Normale Supérieur, he revealed the relevance of the field to everyday life. ","Daniel Cohen was able to discuss Roger Federer's tennis career, Africa's debt crisis and the future of our prosperous yet unhappy civilization with equal passion and brilliance. France's great contemporary intellectual passed away of a blood disease on Sunday, August 20 at the age of 70 at the Necker Hospital in Paris. He leaves behind an exceptional generation of students, including a Nobel Prize winner, as well as a prolific body of thought contained in more than 15 books.Cohen was one of France's most respected economists, famous among the general public for his books that were both educational and enlightening. ""Daniel Cohen was a teacher, a man of ideals and pedagogy, a man of debate and commitment. We lose a great intellectual, an economist who made French research shine, a sincere humanist,"" wrote French President Emmanuel Macron on X (formerly Twitter).Born on June 16, 1953 in Tunis, Cohen spent his childhood in Paris, pampered by his mother, a pharmacist, and his father, a doctor. He was 15 at the time of the May 68 student revolts, his first political awakening. He excelled at math and his father hoped to see him attend France's elite engineering university, École Polytechnique, in Paris. He passed the entrance exam, but chose instead the École Normale Supérieure, achieving the prestigious agrégation teaching certification in mathematics in 1976. Despite his focus on math, the oil crisis of 1973, which signaled the end of the post-war boom, intrigued him enough for him to focus on the analysis of this fundamental shift, which would result in inflation, unemployment and deindustrialization a few years later. It was the end of one era in global economics and the beginning of another.""We shared the same passion for the novels of Kundera, García Márquez and Vargas Llosa, where politics and literature intertwined,"" said historian and philosopher Michel Marian, whom he befriended at the École Normale. At the time, economics courses turned their attention to the slow decomposition of Marxism. The gifted mathematician never neglected the study of politics, culture and economics as necessary dimensions to understand and explain the world.The French introduction to his first book for the general public, The Misfortunes of Prosperity (1994), opens with an analogy between the disappearance of growth and that of Mademoiselle Albertine, who causes Proust much suffering in his In Search of Lost Time. ""But growth didn't return, and a disappointed economic policy ended up declaring its own futility, blaming unfaithful growth for its own misfortunes"": From the early 1990s, Cohen diagnosed the changing world in a style that was also highly literary.",Obituaries,daniel cohen able discuss roger federers tennis career africas debt crisis future prosperous yet unhappy civilization equal passion brilliance frances great contemporary intellectual passed away blood disease sunday august age necker hospital paris leaves behind exceptional generation students including nobel prize winner well prolific body thought contained books cohen one frances respected economists famous among general public books educational enlightening daniel cohen teacher man ideals pedagogy man debate commitment lose great intellectual economist made french research shine sincere humanist wrote french president emmanuel macron formerly twitter born june tunis cohen spent childhood paris pampered mother pharmacist father doctor time may student revolts first political awakening excelled math father hoped see attend frances elite engineering university cole polytechnique paris passed entrance exam chose instead cole normale sup rieure achieving prestigious agr gation teaching certification mathematics despite focus math oil crisis signaled end post war boom intrigued enough focus analysis fundamental shift would result inflation unemployment deindustrialization years later end one era global economics beginning another shared passion novels kundera garc rquez vargas llosa politics literature intertwined said historian philosopher michel marian befriended cole normale time economics courses turned attention slow decomposition marxism gifted mathematician never neglected study politics culture economics necessary dimensions understand explain world french introduction first book general public misfortunes prosperity opens analogy disappearance growth mademoiselle albertine causes proust much suffering search lost time growth didnt return disappointed economic policy ended declaring futility blaming unfaithful growth misfortunes early cohen diagnosed changing world style also highly literary,daniel cohen abl discuss roger feder tenni career africa debt crisi futur prosper yet unhappi civil equal passion brillianc franc great contemporari intellectu pass away blood diseas sunday august age necker hospit pari leav behind except gener student includ nobel prize winner well prolif bodi thought contain book cohen one franc respect economist famou among gener public book educ enlighten daniel cohen teacher man ideal pedagogi man debat commit lose great intellectu economist made french research shine sincer humanist wrote french presid emmanuel macron formerli twitter born june tuni cohen spent childhood pari pamper mother pharmacist father doctor time may student revolt first polit awaken excel math father hope see attend franc elit engin univers cole polytechniqu pari pass entranc exam chose instead cole normal sup rieur achiev prestigi agr gation teach certif mathemat despit focu math oil crisi signal end post war boom intrigu enough focu analysi fundament shift would result inflat unemploy deindustri year later end one era global econom begin anoth share passion novel kundera garc rquez varga llosa polit literatur intertwin said historian philosoph michel marian befriend cole normal time econom cours turn attent slow decomposit marxism gift mathematician never neglect studi polit cultur econom necessari dimens understand explain world french introduct first book gener public misfortun prosper open analog disappear growth mademoisel albertin caus proust much suffer search lost time growth didnt return disappoint econom polici end declar futil blame unfaith growth misfortun earli cohen diagnos chang world style also highli literari
"Italian pop singer Toto Cutugno, an inspiration for French hits, dies","    The singer and composer of over 300 melodies enjoyed huge success in the 1970s and 1980s, notably with 'L’Italiano' in 1983. In France, his tunes were used for 'L’Été Indien,' 'Laissez-moi Danser' and 'Méditerranéenne.' ","The song L’Italiano begins with ""Lasciatemi cantare/Con la chitarra ai mano"" (""Let me sing/With the guitar in my hands""). First comes the slightly husky voice of its singer and songwriter Toto Cutugno, then an acoustic guitar, violins and a mandolin as a counterpoint. The composer of over 300 melodies for himself and others, including his fellow Italians Ornella Vanoni and Adriano Celentano and several French pop stars, Cutugno will be publicly famous for the 1983 hit L’Italiano (lyrics by Cristiano Minellono). Salvatore Cutugno, known as Toto Cutugno, died on Tuesday, August 22, in Milan, aged 80. His manager broke the news in the late afternoon, saying that ""the singer’s condition had worsened in recent months following a long illness.""Born on July 7, 1943, in Fosdinovo, Tuscany, the second of three children, Cutugno grew up in La Spezia, Liguria. His father, a Sicilian naval non-commissioned officer, was a trumpeter in the municipal brass band. In an interview with Le Monde in 2018, Toto Cutugno summed up his introduction to music in just a few words: ""My father (...) took me to a rehearsal when I was eight, and the conductor asked him if I could play the marching drum. From the drum, I moved on to the drum kit, then the accordion and the piano.""He played the drums in his first two bands, Ghigo e i Goghi, about which little is known today, and Toto e i Tati, founded in 1965. Toto e i Tati recorded a handful of 7-inch records up to the end of the 1960s, and scored a minor hit in Italy with La Ragazza Della Spiaggia, a whimsical pop song with choirs, an organ and violins. His next group, Albatros, founded in 1974 with the help of lyricist and producer Vito Pallavicini, offered a little more substance.Cutugno was the lead singer, recording several singles and an album until 1978. Some of the group’s songs were adapted into French, the most well-known among them being Africa, the story of a Black American singer who encourages a return to Africa, sung in English by Cutugno. In 1975 the song was adapted as L’Été Indien for French singer-songwriter Joe Dassin by lyricists Claude Lemesle and Pierre Delanoë. In 1976, Dassin also sang Monja Monja which became Il Était Une Fois Nous Deux while Nel Cuore Nei Sensi became Voici Les Clefs for singer-songwriter Gérard Lenorman.At the end of the 1970s, Toto Cutugno collaborated with French music stars. He wrote En Chantant for singer Michel Sardou in 1976, even as he rose to major fame in Italy with his second solo album, Voglio l’Anima; of which the eponymous track was adapted for singer and actress Dalida in 1979 under the title Laissez-moi Danser. In the early 1980s, he released Solo Noi (1980), whose title track won him a prize at the San Remo Festival – in which he participated over a dozen times with such hits as Innamorata, Innamorato, Innamorati (1981), La Mia Musica (1982) and, perhaps most famously, the L’Italiano album in 1983.",Obituaries,song italiano begins lasciatemi cantare con chitarra mano let sing guitar hands first comes slightly husky voice singer songwriter toto cutugno acoustic guitar violins mandolin counterpoint composer melodies others including fellow italians ornella vanoni adriano celentano several french pop stars cutugno publicly famous hit italiano lyrics cristiano minellono salvatore cutugno known toto cutugno died tuesday august milan aged manager broke news late afternoon saying singer condition worsened recent months following long illness born july fosdinovo tuscany second three children cutugno grew spezia liguria father sicilian naval non commissioned officer trumpeter municipal brass band interview monde toto cutugno summed introduction music words father took rehearsal eight conductor asked could play marching drum drum moved drum kit accordion piano played drums first two bands ghigo goghi little known today toto tati founded toto tati recorded handful inch records end scored minor hit italy ragazza della spiaggia whimsical pop song choirs organ violins next group albatros founded help lyricist producer vito pallavicini offered little substance cutugno lead singer recording several singles album group songs adapted french well known among africa story black american singer encourages return africa sung english cutugno song adapted indien french singer songwriter joe dassin lyricists claude lemesle pierre delano dassin also sang monja monja became tait une fois nous deux nel cuore nei sensi became voici les clefs singer songwriter rard lenorman end toto cutugno collaborated french music stars wrote chantant singer michel sardou even rose major fame italy second solo album voglio anima eponymous track adapted singer actress dalida title laissez moi danser early released solo noi whose title track prize san remo festival participated dozen times hits innamorata innamorato innamorati mia musica perhaps famously italiano album,song italiano begin lasciatemi cantar con chitarra mano let sing guitar hand first come slightli huski voic singer songwrit toto cutugno acoust guitar violin mandolin counterpoint compos melodi other includ fellow italian ornella vanoni adriano celentano sever french pop star cutugno publicli famou hit italiano lyric cristiano minellono salvator cutugno known toto cutugno die tuesday august milan age manag broke news late afternoon say singer condit worsen recent month follow long ill born juli fosdinovo tuscani second three children cutugno grew spezia liguria father sicilian naval non commiss offic trumpet municip brass band interview mond toto cutugno sum introduct music word father took rehears eight conductor ask could play march drum drum move drum kit accordion piano play drum first two band ghigo goghi littl known today toto tati found toto tati record hand inch record end score minor hit itali ragazza della spiaggia whimsic pop song choir organ violin next group albatro found help lyricist produc vito pallavicini offer littl substanc cutugno lead singer record sever singl album group song adapt french well known among africa stori black american singer encourag return africa sung english cutugno song adapt indien french singer songwrit joe dassin lyricist claud lemesl pierr delano dassin also sang monja monja becam tait une foi nou deux nel cuor nei sensi becam voici le clef singer songwrit rard lenorman end toto cutugno collabor french music star wrote chantant singer michel sardou even rose major fame itali second solo album voglio anima eponym track adapt singer actress dalida titl laissez moi danser earli releas solo noi whose titl track prize san remo festiv particip dozen time hit innamorata innamorato innamorati mia musica perhap famous italiano album
Popular game show host Bob Barker has died,    Barker was a household name for a half-century as host of 'Truth or Consequences' and 'The Price Is Right'. ,"Popular game show host Bob Barker, a household name for a half-century as host of ""Truth or Consequences"" and ""The Price Is Right,"" has died at his home in Los Angeles. Barker was 99. He died Saturday, August 26, according to publicist Roger Neal.Barker retired in June 2007, telling his studio audience: ""I thank you, thank you, thank you for inviting me into your home for more than 50 years."" Barker was working in radio in 1956 when producer Ralph Edwards invited him to audition as the new host of ""Truth or Consequences,"" a game show in which audience members had to do wacky stunts – the ""consequence"" – if they failed to answer a question – the ""truth,"" which was always the silly punchline to a riddle no one was ever meant to furnish.In a 1996 interview with The Associated Press, Barker recalled receiving the news that he had been hired: ""I know exactly where I was, I know exactly how I felt: I hung up the phone and said to my wife, 'Dorothy Jo, I got it!'"" Barker stayed with ""Truth or Consequences"" for 18 years – including several years in a syndicated version.Meanwhile, he began hosting a resurrected version of ""The Price Is Right"" in 1972. It would become TV's longest-running game show and the last on a broadcast network of what in TV's early days had numbered dozens. ""I have grown old in your service,"" the silver-haired, perennially tanned Barker joked on a prime-time television retrospective in the mid-'90s. In all, he taped more than 5,000 shows in his career.Born in Darrington, Washington, in 1923, Barker spent part of his childhood on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where his widowed mother had taken a teaching job. The family later moved to Springfield, Mo., where he attended high school. He served in the Navy in World War II.He married Dorothy Jo Gideon, his high school sweetheart; she died in 1981 after 37 years of marriage. They had no children.Barker was given a lifetime achievement award at the 26th annual Daytime Emmy Awards in 1999.

"Mohamed Al-Fayed, Egyptian billionaire tycoon, has died at 94","    The enigmatic billionaire, whose eldest son died in a car crash with Princess Diana, was known for his iconic business ventures and his strained relationship with the British establishment. ","Few things were beyond the reach of billionaire Egyptian tycoon Mohamed Al-Fayed who has died at the age of 94. Hotels, yachts and a football club were bought with ease but he never acquired the recognition he craved.His son Dodi's fateful relationship with princess Diana might have been the moment Fayed finally gained acceptance by the British ""Establishment"" elite. Instead it marked his permanent estrangement after he insisted – without evidence – that Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip had ordered the Paris car crash in which Diana and Dodi were killed to prevent her from marrying a Muslim.Fayed lived most of his life in Britain, where for decades he was never far from the headlines. But to his frustration, he was never granted UK citizenship nor admitted into the upper echelons of British society.Fayed will be remembered most for his outspoken and often foul-mouthed manner, his revenge on the Conservative party, his controversial purchase of the Harrods department store, and his ownership of Fulham football club and the Ritz hotel in Paris.With a business empire encompassing shipping, property, banking, oil, retail and construction, Fayed was also a philanthropist, whose foundation helped children in the UK, Thailand and Mongolia.His gift for self-invention – he added the ""Al-"" prefix to his surname and a 1988 UK government report described his claims of wealthy ancestry as ""completely bogus"" – led segments of the British press to dub him the ""Phoney Pharoah.""Far from being the scion of a dynasty of cotton and shipping barons, he made himself out to be, Fayed was the son of a poor Alexandrian schoolteacher who, after an early venture flogging lemonade, set out in business selling sewing machines. He later had the good luck to start working for the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, who recognized his business abilities and employed him in his furniture export business in Saudi Arabia.He became an advisor to the Sultan of Brunei in the mid-1960s and moved to Britain in the 1970s. Fayed bought the Ritz in 1979 with his brother and the pair snapped up Harrods six years later after a long and bitter takeover battle with British businessman Roland ""Tiny"" Rowland.A subsequent government investigation into the takeover, officially published in 1990, found that Fayed and his brother had been dishonest about their wealth and origins to secure the takeover. They called the claims unfair. Five years later, his first application for British citizenship was rejected.Revenge followed swiftly. Soon after, Fayed told the press that he had paid Conservative MPs to ask questions in parliament on his behalf. This brought down two prominent politicians, while Fayed also exposed Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken's involvement in a Saudi arms deal. Aitken was later jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice.The defining tragedy of Fayed's life came in August 1997: Dodi and Princess Diana died when a car driven by one of Fayed's employees, chauffeur Henri Paul, crashed in a Paris road tunnel. For years afterward, Fayed refused to accept the deaths were the result of speeding and intoxication by Paul, who also died.The distraught Fayed accused the royal family of being behind the deaths and commissioned two memorials to the couple at Harrods. One, unveiled in 1998, was a kitsch pyramid-shaped display with photos of Diana and Dodi, a wine glass purported to be from their final dinner and a ring that he claimed his son bought for the princess. The other, a copper statue of the couple releasing an albatross, was entitled ""Innocent Victims"" – a reflection of his view that Dodi and Diana ""were murdered"".Fayed's claims against the royal family came at a price. Harrods lost a royal warrant bestowed by Prince Philip in 2000 after what Buckingham Palace called ""a significant decline in the trading relationship"" between the prince and the store.Later that year, Fayed ordered the removal of all remaining royal warrants – effectively a regal seal of approval – for supplying the queen, queen mother and Prince Charles, the now King Charles III. The Establishment ""dislike my outspokenness and determination to get the truth"", he said, as he announced his exile to Switzerland in 2003 because of his claims and what he said was the ""unfair"" treatment at the hands of the tax authorities.Fayed sold Harrods in 2010 to the investment arm of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund for a reported £1.5 billion ($2.2 billion), although it was once reported he wanted to remain there even in death. He told the Financial Times in 2002 that he wanted his body to be put on display in a glass mausoleum on Harrods roof ""so people can come and visit me"". Despite his paranoia, secrecy and eccentricities, Fayed's success with the prestige department store was undeniable. Within a decade of his taking over, sales increased by 50% and profits rose from £16 million to £62 million.Other successes included at Fulham, which he transformed from a struggling outfit into a top-flight side. But even here he was ridiculed and he eventually sold up. He claimed in 2014 they were relegated because a giant statue he had commissioned of Michael Jackson outside the ground was removed. Critics, he said characteristically, ""can go to hell"". According to the Forbes list of the world's billionaires, Fayed was worth $1.9 billion in November 2022.",Obituaries,things beyond reach billionaire egyptian tycoon mohamed fayed died age hotels

French secularism: 'The 2004 law banning religious symbols in schools was ambiguous from the outset',"The legislation has not prevented recent debates on abayas in France. This is due to a specific conception of secularism that is at odds with the legal precedent, writes legal expert Anne Fornerod.","Despite a memorandum from the French Education Ministry dated November 9, 2022, the wearing of the abaya in public schools continues to cause controversy and has led to the creation of a new text.While delivering on the promise of the ban announced by Education Minister Gabriel Attal, the August 31 memorandum unsurprisingly consists of a reminder of the exisiting legislation (a memorandum cannot add to an existing law). This is the March 15, 2004 law that applies the principle of secularism to the wearing of symbols or clothing expressing a religious affiliation in public schools.In addition to providing an exceptionally strict framework for the wearing of religious symbols by students, the law's explanatory memorandum stated that its aim is ""to enable teachers and school heads to carry out their duties with peace of mind, by establishing a clear rule."" Today, however, it is ""the growing popularity of abaya or khamis-type clothing [that] has given rise to a large number of questions as to what should be done.""How can these questions be explained when the 2004 law seems clear and the applicable law, inevitably case-by-case, has been regularly clarified ever since? There are two possible explanations for this persistent need for further directives: The 2004 law was ambiguous from the outset, and it enshrined a specific conception of secularism.Specifically designed for the Islamic head covering but subject to the requirements of its legislative status, the March 15, 2004 law was intended to set a general standard. The law's contortions of terminology to avoid designating the Islamic veil are at the root of a concept that needed clarification before it could be implemented.The May 18, 2004 memorandum introduced a list of symbols and outfits ""the wearing of which leads to immediate recognition of one's religious affiliation"" (Islamic headscarf, kippah, large cross). And, above all, it interprets the law as prohibiting students ""from invoking the religious character"" they attach to a symbol or outfit.

'Macron attending the Pope's mass in Marseille is a breach of secularism',"By attending Pope Francis' mass on September 23, Macron would unjustifiably breach the 1905 law on the separation of the church and government, explains historian Jean-Noël Jeanneney.","Emmanuel Macron's presence at the mass that the pontiff will celebrate on Saturday, September 23, at the Stade-Vélodrome in Marseille is ill-advised. Of course, it is absolutely legitimate that he welcomes Francis, outside places of worship, with all the honors due to him as head of state – that is, if the Pope so wishes, which he appears not to. But we're talking about a very different matter: The French Republic, embodied by its president, would be involved in the ritual expression of a religion that is practiced, among others, on French soil. Is Macron courting traditionalists? The price is too high for the nation as a whole.After the 1918 armistice, Paris' Archbishop Cardinal Léon-Adolphe Amette organized a Te Deum (a Christian hymn in Latin) at Notre Dame Cathedral to thank God for the end of the First World War, and invited the representatives of the French government. At the time, the ""Father of Victory"" Georges Clemenceau was head of government and he radically opposed the idea. He only agreed that the president's wife, Henriette Poincaré, attend the service in her personal capacity. Later, Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier, Archbishop of Malines (Belgium), urged Clemenceau in his leading role at the Paris Peace Conference to ""invite a representative of the principal nations of the Allies to preside over an act of religion."" Should the French government attend church ceremonies? Definitely not, Clemenceau replied, explaining that French law absolutely precluded it. The government, tasked with ardently protecting the various religious doctrines and their practice, was not to interfere with any of them.France must reject any positions taken by public authorities that are contrary to the spirit of secularism. Rather, French citizens must demand rigorous application of the principle, otherwise, the Republic may tumble down a slippery slope. Today, many people – among them, President Macron – evoke this or that precedent to justify the president's impending breach of the 1905 law. None of them are valid.When John Paul II came to France in 1996 to celebrate the anniversary of Clovis' baptism (France's first Catholic king), former president Jacques Chirac rightly welcomed him as sovereign of the Vatican. But as soon as the Pope announced that he would be on a ""pastoral visit"" (which is also Francis' current intention if I've understood correctly), the French president was right not to join him at a Catholic celebration but rather to stand before him as the president of a ""republican and secular"" France.",Religions,emmanuel macrons presence mass pontiff celebrate saturday september stade lodrome marseille ill advised course absolutely legitimate welcomes francis outside places worship honors due head state pope wishes appears talking different matter french republic embodied president would involved ritual expression religion practiced among others french soil macron courting traditionalists price high nation whole armistice paris archbishop cardinal adolphe amette organized deum christian hymn latin notre dame cathedral thank god end first world war invited representatives french government time father victory georges clemenceau head government radically opposed idea agreed presidents wife henriette poincar attend service personal capacity later cardinal sir joseph mercier archbishop malines belgium urged clemenceau leading role paris peace conference invite representative principal nations allies preside act religion french government attend church ceremonies definitely clemenceau replied explaining french law absolutely precluded government tasked ardently protecting various religious doctrines practice interfere france must reject positions taken public authorities contrary spirit secularism rather french citizens must demand rigorous application principle otherwise republic may tumble slippery slope today many people among president macron evoke precedent justify presidents impending breach law none valid john paul came france celebrate anniversary clovis baptism frances first catholic king former president jacques chirac rightly welcomed sovereign vatican soon pope announced would pastoral visit also francis current intention ive understood correctly french president right join catholic celebration rather stand president republican secular france,emmanuel macron presenc mass pontiff celebr saturday septemb stade lodrom marseil ill advis cours absolut legitim welcom franci outsid place worship honor due head state pope wish appear talk differ matter french republ embodi presid would involv ritual express religion practic among other french soil macron court traditionalist price high nation whole armistic pari archbishop cardin adolph amett organ deum christian hymn latin notr dame cathedr thank god end first world war invit repres french govern time father victori georg clemenceau head govern radic oppos idea agre presid wife henriett poincar attend servic person capac later cardin sir joseph mercier archbishop malin belgium urg clemenceau lead role pari peac confer invit repres princip nation alli presid act religion french govern attend church ceremoni definit clemenceau repli explain french law absolut preclud govern task ardent protect variou religi doctrin practic interfer franc must reject posit taken public author contrari spirit secular rather french citizen must demand rigor applic principl otherwis republ may tumbl slipperi slope today mani peopl among presid macron evok preced justifi presid impend breach law none valid john paul came franc celebr anniversari clovi baptism franc first cathol king former presid jacqu chirac rightli welcom sovereign vatican soon pope announc would pastor visit also franci current intent ive understood correctli french presid right join cathol celebr rather stand presid republican secular franc
"Why Pope Francis is coming 'to Marseille, not to France'","    The pope's visit to the melting pot Mediterranean city comes against the backdrop of the migration crisis, a subject close to his heart, while the concerns of French Catholics appear secondary. ","A majestic imperial residence, built on the orders of Napoleon III for Empress Eugénie, the Palais du Pharo offers a breathtaking view of Marseille's port. It is there, in this monument symbolizing the power of the French state in the 19th century, that Pope Francis will conclude his visit to the Mediterranean city with a speech on Saturday, September 23.The country's second-largest city, with an identity inseparable from the waves of immigration that have shaped it, Marseille is the setting of Pope Francis's second trip to France on Friday and Saturday. In 2014, he went to Strasbourg for a visit to the European Parliament, conceived as a meeting with the EU member states, rather than specifically with France.The logic, this time, remains the same. ""I'll go to Marseille, but not to France,"" Pope Francis openly declared on the plane back from the World Youth Days in Lisbon in early August, before adding that he had nothing against France.The head of the Catholic Church has never made any secret of the fact that Europe is not his priority. Focusing on the marginalised, he has made Asia, Africa, and smaller, poorer countries and those at war his major preoccupations. He has visited Canada to acknowledge the suffering of indigenous peoples, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan to call for an end to war, and Mongolia to pay tribute to a minority church.In responding to the invitation to visit this multicultural city by the sea, Pope Francis is, above all, coming to talk about migrants, a subject particularly close to his heart. This theme has marked his 10-year pontificate, which has seen him make trips to Greece in December 2021 and to the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2013, just a few months after his election.""Who is responsible for the blood of these brothers and sisters? No one is. We all answer like this: it's not me, it's probably someone else... We've lost the sense of fraternal responsibility,"" he said then, referring to ""boats that instead of being a path of hope have been a path of death"". These words resonate still today on Lampedusa, which over the past year has become the main gateway for migrants seeking to reach Europe. Since January, almost 130,000 people have arrived in Italy by sea, twice as many as at the same time in 2022, and the island is in crisis.The tragedies are neverending. Whether off Lampedusa in August, or in the Ionian Sea in June, when 79 bodies were recovered, they continue to turn the Mediterranean into ""a graveyard,"" as Francis said in August.",Religions,majestic imperial residence built orders napoleon iii empress eug nie palais pharo offers breathtaking view marseilles port monument symbolizing power french state century pope francis conclude visit mediterranean city speech saturday september countrys second largest city identity inseparable waves immigration shaped marseille setting pope franciss second trip france friday saturday went strasbourg visit european parliament conceived meeting member states rather specifically france logic time remains ill marseille france pope francis openly declared plane back world youth days lisbon early august adding nothing france head catholic church never made secret fact europe priority focusing marginalised made asia africa smaller poorer countries war major preoccupations visited canada acknowledge suffering indigenous peoples democratic republic congo south sudan call end war mongolia pay tribute minority church responding invitation visit multicultural city sea pope francis coming talk migrants subject particularly close heart theme marked year pontificate seen make trips greece december italian island lampedusa months election responsible blood brothers sisters one answer like probably someone else weve lost sense fraternal responsibility said referring boats instead path hope path death words resonate still today lampedusa past year become main gateway migrants seeking reach europe since january almost people arrived italy sea twice many time island crisis tragedies neverending whether lampedusa august ionian sea june bodies recovered continue turn mediterranean graveyard francis said august,majest imperi resid built order napoleon iii empress eug nie palai pharo offer breathtak view marseil port monument symbol power french state centuri pope franci conclud visit mediterranean citi speech saturday septemb countri second largest citi ident insepar wave immigr shape marseil set pope franciss second trip franc friday saturday went strasbourg visit european parliament conceiv meet member state rather specif franc logic time remain ill marseil franc pope franci openli declar plane back world youth day lisbon earli august ad noth franc head cathol church never made secret fact europ prioriti focus marginalis made asia africa smaller poorer countri war major preoccup visit canada acknowledg suffer indigen peopl democrat republ congo south sudan call end war mongolia pay tribut minor church respond invit visit multicultur citi sea pope franci come talk migrant subject particularli close heart theme mark year pontif seen make trip greec decemb italian island lampedusa month elect respons blood brother sister one answer like probabl someon els weve lost sens fratern respons said refer boat instead path hope path death word reson still today lampedusa past year becom main gateway migrant seek reach europ sinc januari almost peopl arriv itali sea twice mani time island crisi tragedi neverend whether lampedusa august ionian sea june bodi recov continu turn mediterranean graveyard franci said august
Unprecedented security for Pope's visit to Marseille,"    The arrival of Pope Francis, coupled with the presence of Emmanuel Macron, will see 5,000 law enforcement officers on duty in the port city, where 100,000 people are expcted to turn out. ","Pope Francis' visit to Marseille, with the added pressure of the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron, represents a complex security challenge for the French authorities, who must ensure the safety of two heads of state without detracting from the celebrations of popular devotion. They will have to manage a kilometre-long public procession, as well as screen 60,000 worshippers at the entrance to the Stade Vélodrome.Frédérique Camilleri, police prefect for the Bouches-du-Rhône region in the south of France in which Marseille sits, has spent nine months working to deliver ""a plan never before seen in the history of Marseille"". Five thousand police officers, supported by 1,000 security guards, will be on duty on Friday, September 22 and Saturday, September 23. Several hundred civil servants who were to be on leave on these days have been called in.The Pope is expected to land at Marseille-Provence airport on Friday at 4:15pm. He will be welcomed by Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne. The Holy Father will be preceded at all the sites he is due to visit by mine clearance teams. First at Notre-Dame de la Garde, then on Saturday at the Palais du Pharo and the Stade Vélodrome.However, a change to the program announced on Wednesday, September 20 in the Vatican’s daily bulletin has upset the planned arrangements. Saturday's meeting with people experiencing economic hardship, as requested by Pope Francis, will be held not at the archbishop's palace, but at the House of the Missionaries of Charity. A highly symbolic choice, as the mission is located in the heart of one of Marseille's poorest areas, at the junction of the Saint-Mauront and Belle-de-Mai districts, historically home to the poorest of immigrants. Security services had to be called in urgently to check the area.Following the example set by Macron when he came to present the Marseille en Grand plan, the police have decided to set up large, sealed perimeters around the event venues, with strict screening at a distance. At the Stade Vélodrome, only those with a ticket for the mass will be able to access the site. On the Prado, where the Popemobile is due to start its journey at 3:30pm on Saturday, access will only be possible from 9:30am.The same arrangements will be in place in the morning around the Palais du Pharo which, given its position at the entrance to the Vieux-Port, will also be under surveillance by the maritime police. Air Force aircraft will be monitoring any air intrusion during the 26 hours of the Pope's visit, and an anti-drone system has also been deployed.",Religions,pope francis visit marseille added pressure presence french president emmanuel macron represents complex security challenge french authorities must ensure safety two heads state without detracting celebrations popular devotion manage kilometre long public procession well screen worshippers entrance stade lodrome rique camilleri police prefect bouches region south france marseille sits spent nine months working deliver plan never seen history marseille five thousand police officers supported security guards duty friday september saturday september several hundred civil servants leave days called pope expected land marseille provence airport friday welcomed prime minister elisabeth borne holy father preceded sites due visit mine clearance teams first notre dame garde saturday palais pharo stade lodrome however change program announced wednesday september vatican daily bulletin upset planned arrangements saturdays meeting people experiencing economic hardship requested pope francis held archbishops palace house missionaries charity highly symbolic choice mission located heart one marseilles poorest areas junction saint mauront belle mai districts historically home poorest immigrants security services called urgently check area following example set macron came present marseille grand plan police decided set large sealed perimeters around event venues strict screening distance stade lodrome ticket mass able access site prado popemobile due start journey saturday access possible arrangements place morning around palais pharo given position entrance vieux port also surveillance maritime police air force aircraft monitoring air intrusion hours popes visit anti drone system also deployed,pope franci visit marseil ad pressur presenc french presid emmanuel macron repres complex secur challeng french author must ensur safeti two head state without detract celebr popular devot manag kilometr long public process well screen worshipp entranc stade lodrom riqu camilleri polic prefect bouch region south franc marseil sit spent nine month work deliv plan never seen histori marseil five thousand polic offic support secur guard duti friday septemb saturday septemb sever hundr civil servant leav day call pope expect land marseil provenc airport friday welcom prime minist elisabeth born holi father preced site due visit mine clearanc team first notr dame gard saturday palai pharo stade lodrom howev chang program announc wednesday septemb vatican daili bulletin upset plan arrang saturday meet peopl experienc econom hardship request pope franci held archbishop palac hous missionari chariti highli symbol choic mission locat heart one marseil poorest area junction saint mauront bell mai district histor home poorest immigr secur servic call urgent check area follow exampl set macron came present marseil grand plan polic decid set larg seal perimet around event venu strict screen distanc stade lodrom ticket mass abl access site prado popemobil due start journey saturday access possibl arrang place morn around palai pharo given posit entranc vieux port also surveil maritim polic air forc aircraft monitor air intrus hour pope visit anti drone system also deploy
Pope Francis arrives in Marseille to urge Mediterranean countries to welcome migrants,"    The pope, who prefers to visit small Catholic communities around the world, has made clear that his trip is not to France but specifically Marseille. ","Pope Francis arrived in Marseille on Friday, September 22, for a two-day visit expected to focus on the surge in migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean, bringing a message of tolerance amid bitter debate over how Europe manages asylum seekers.The French port was decked out in the yellow and white colours of the Vatican for the first visit by a pope to France's second-largest city in 500 years, where he will celebrate a stadium mass on Saturday.The desperate conditions that cause many people to leave their homes for a new life, and the risks they take to do so, have been a key theme in the 86-year-old's decade as head of the worldwide Catholic Church. But his visit to the French port city, to take part in a meeting of Mediterranean-area Catholic bishops and young people, puts him at the centre of a political storm.A surge in migrant boats arriving from North Africa on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa last week triggered outrage both in Italy and beyond. The European Union promised more help for Rome while France, amid wrangling over a draft law governing migrant arrivals there, said it would not accept anyone from Lampedusa.Migration ""represents a challenge that is not easy... but which must be faced together"", Francis said at the Vatican on Sunday. ""It is essential for the future of all, which will be prosperous only if it is built on fraternity, putting human dignity and real people, especially those most in need, in first place.""He becomes the first pope in 500 years to visit the city, a gateway for immigrants and also home to some of the poorest neighbourhoods in Europe, many of which are plagued by drug trafficking.Parts of the city were decked out Friday in the yellow and white colours of the Vatican, particularly on the main Avenue du Prado, through which the pope will travel in his popemobile on Saturday. Regional newspaper La Provence welcomed his arrival with the headline ""Habemus papam"", the famous Latin phrase meaning ""We have a pope!"" used on the election of a pontiff.Ahead of what will be his 44th overseas trip, and in increasingly fragile health, Francis admitted this month that papal voyages were not as easy as they used to be. He underwent hernia surgery in June, less than two years after having colon surgery, and routinely uses a wheelchair due to a troublesome knee.The pope was met at the airport by French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne. He will head to the Basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde, a symbolic monument overlooking the city, for a prayer with local clergy on Friday afternoon.That will be followed by a moment of meditation with representatives of other religions in front of a memorial to sailors and migrants lost at sea. The United Nations estimates more than 28,000 migrants who tried to cross the Mediterranean have gone missing since 2014.Tens of thousands of pilgrims are expected for the visit, despite the decline of Catholicism in France.On Saturday afternoon, Francis will lead a mass in the Velodrome stadium, with 57,000 people expected, including French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron's decision to attend has sparked controversy among left-wing politicians in the officially secular country.Some right-wing politicians have meanwhile criticised the pope's stance on migrants – but Marseille mayor Benoit Payan said the pontiff ""has a message to deliver, not advice to give."" ""We have a pope who is particularly courageous and who, in the turmoil of the world, in the crises we are currently facing, has a universal message... of peace,"" he told Agence France-Presse (AFP).",Religions,pope francis arrived marseille friday september two day visit expected focus surge migrants trying cross mediterranean bringing message tolerance amid bitter debate europe manages asylum seekers french port decked yellow white colours vatican first visit pope frances second largest city years celebrate stadium mass saturday desperate conditions cause many people leave homes new life risks take key theme year olds decade head worldwide catholic church visit french port city take part meeting mediterranean area catholic bishops young people puts centre political storm surge migrant boats arriving north africa tiny italian island lampedusa last week triggered outrage italy beyond european union promised help rome france amid wrangling draft law governing migrant arrivals said would accept anyone lampedusa migration represents challenge easy must faced together francis said vatican sunday essential future prosperous built fraternity putting human dignity real people especially need first place becomes first pope years visit city gateway immigrants also home poorest neighbourhoods europe many plagued drug trafficking parts city decked friday yellow white colours vatican particularly main avenue prado pope travel popemobile saturday regional newspaper provence welcomed arrival headline habemus papam famous latin phrase meaning pope used election pontiff ahead overseas trip increasingly fragile health francis admitted month papal voyages easy used underwent hernia surgery june less two years colon surgery routinely uses wheelchair due troublesome knee pope met airport french prime minister elisabeth borne head basilica notre dame garde symbolic monument overlooking city prayer local clergy friday afternoon followed moment meditation representatives religions front memorial sailors migrants lost sea united nations estimates migrants tried cross mediterranean gone missing since tens thousands pilgrims expected visit despite decline catholicism france saturday afternoon francis lead mass velodrome stadium people expected including french president emmanuel macron macrons decision attend sparked controversy among left wing politicians officially secular country right wing politicians meanwhile criticised popes stance migrants marseille mayor benoit payan said pontiff message deliver advice give pope particularly courageous turmoil world crises currently facing universal message peace told agence france presse afp,pope franci arriv marseil friday septemb two day visit expect focu surg migrant tri cross mediterranean bring messag toler amid bitter debat europ manag asylum seeker french port deck yellow white colour vatican first visit pope franc second largest citi year celebr stadium mass saturday desper condit caus mani peopl leav home new life risk take key theme year old decad head worldwid cathol church visit french port citi take part meet mediterranean area cathol bishop young peopl put centr polit storm surg migrant boat arriv north africa tini italian island lampedusa last week trigger outrag itali beyond european union promis help rome franc amid wrangl draft law govern migrant arriv said would accept anyon lampedusa migrat repres challeng easi must face togeth franci said vatican sunday essenti futur prosper built fratern put human digniti real peopl especi need first place becom first pope year visit citi gateway immigr also home poorest neighbourhood europ mani plagu drug traffick part citi deck friday yellow white colour vatican particularli main avenu prado pope travel popemobil saturday region newspap provenc welcom arriv headlin habemu papam famou latin phrase mean pope use elect pontiff ahead oversea trip increasingli fragil health franci admit month papal voyag easi use underw hernia surgeri june less two year colon surgeri routin use wheelchair due troublesom knee pope met airport french prime minist elisabeth born head basilica notr dame gard symbol monument overlook citi prayer local clergi friday afternoon follow moment medit repres religion front memori sailor migrant lost sea unit nation estim migrant tri cross mediterranean gone miss sinc ten thousand pilgrim expect visit despit declin catholic franc saturday afternoon franci lead mass velodrom stadium peopl expect includ french presid emmanuel macron macron decis attend spark controversi among left wing politician offici secular countri right wing politician meanwhil criticis pope stanc migrant marseil mayor benoit payan said pontiff messag deliv advic give pope particularli courag turmoil world crise current face univers messag peac told agenc franc press afp
"Pope Francis urges Europe to save migrants at sea, warning against 'fanaticism of indifference'","    During the start of his visit to Marseille, the Catholic leader singled out 'the disinterest that, with velvet gloves, condemns others to death' while speaking at a memorial dedicated to sailors and migrants lost at sea. ","Pope Francis on Friday, September 22, said European governments had a duty to rescue asylum-seekers who take to sea to escape conflict, warning against a ""paralysis of fear"" as he entered the growing political controversy on the first day of a visit to the French Mediterranean city of Marseille.Marseille was decked out in the yellow and white colors of the Vatican for the first visit by a pope to France's second-largest city in 500 years, where 100,000 people are expected to turn out to greet the pontiff in his ""popemobile"" on Saturday.The 86-year-old is visiting to take part in a meeting of Mediterranean-area Catholic bishops and young people – but his trip comes at a politically sensitive time. As European nations have sought to shift responsibility for taking care of people arriving by sea, the pope singled out ""the disinterest that, with velvet gloves, condemns others to death.""""People who are at risk of drowning when abandoned on the waves must be rescued,"" he said from the hilltop Basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde overlooking the glistening Mediterranean waters. In remarks dedicated to migrants lost at sea, he said, ""It is a duty of humanity, it is a duty of civilization"" to save people in difficulty, warning governments against the ""fanaticism of indifference"" and ""paralysis of fear.""A surge in migrant boats arriving from North Africa on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa last week triggered outrage in Italy and a heated debate across Europe over how to share responsibility for the influx. The desperate conditions that cause many people to leave their homes for a new life, and the risks they take to do so, have been a key theme during Francis' decade as head of the Catholic Church.In unprepared remarks added at the end of his speech, the pope thanked NGOs rescuing migrants in danger at sea and condemned efforts to prevent their activity as ""gestures of hate."" The pontiff had disembarked from his plane at Marseille airport away from the view of cameras, and was pushed in a wheelchair toward French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, who was waiting on the airport tarmac to greet him.Appearing frail but alert and cheerful, he stood up from his wheelchair to acknowledge the welcome by a military band. Afterward, his motorcade took him through the Old Port of Marseille, where he waved from his small white car's open window as crowds lined the streets. Exiting the car on his own, he took the wheelchair again to enter the Basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde, a symbolic monument overlooking the city, for a prayer service with local clergy.Ahead of what is his 44th overseas trip, Francis acknowledged this month that his papal voyages were not as easy as they used to be. Pope Francis underwent hernia surgery in June, less than two years after having colon surgery, and routinely uses a wheelchair because of a troublesome knee.Despite the decline in France of Catholicism, the once-dominant faith, the pope's visit has sparked huge enthusiasm, with almost 60,000 people expected at a mass on Saturday afternoon. ""Habemus papam"" headlined regional newspaper La Provence, using the famous Latin phrase meaning ""We have a pope!"" used on the election of a new pontiff.After the basilica service, Francis joined representatives of other religions for a moment of meditation at a memorial to sailors and migrants lost at sea. On Saturday morning, Francis will take part in the closing session of the ""Mediterranean Meetings"" event. As well as migration, it will cover issues such as economic inequality and climate change – also themes close to the pope's heart.On Saturday afternoon, Francis will lead a mass at the Velodrome stadium, with French President Emmanuel Macron among those due to attend. Macron's attendance has sparked controversy among left-wing politicians in the officially secular country.

Pope's visit to Marseille rekindles complex relationship with the French,"    Many among the French faithful believe the highly political Francis takes little interest in their concerns, whether liturgical or pertaining to the trauma of sex scandals in the Church. ","Béatrice (all those mentioned by first name declined to be fully identified) still remembers the election of Francis in March 2013. Enthused at the time by the figure of Buenos Aires' former archbishop, she found herself even caught up in a ""pope frenzy,"" she recalled with a smile. The young Catholic from Lyon, now in her thirties and a mother, had even ""liked"" and followed dozens of fan pages relating to the new pontiff on social media.""We had been waiting for a while and I was happy to have a new pope. I had total confidence in him and the institution,"" Béatrice said before admitting: ""I didn't even imagine it could go wrong."" Like many French Catholics who will follow the pope's two-day visit to Marseille remotely from Friday, September 22, Béatrice has an ambiguous relationship with Francis.This is not, of course, an open rejection. The Argentinian is the head of the Catholic Church, and the faithful vow to him the respect and devotion that go with the office and the moral magisterium it carries. Yet, on closer examination, a kind of distance and frostiness seems to have set in between some French faithful and a pope, many of whom feel he never speaks to them. A pope whose preoccupations they imagine to be far removed from their own, seeing him crisscrossing the planet, visiting the furthest reaches without paying any particular attention to ""old Europe,"" unlike his predecessor, Benedict XVI.Many of these faithful noticed France was not the primary focus of the papal visit. The pontiff repeatedly insisted he was visiting Marseille, not France. ""French Catholics are disappointed because, for Francis, France is not a priority in his pontificate. Moreover, he doesn't seem to know it that well,"" said Céline Béraud, a religions specialist at the Ecole des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (School of Advanced Studies in Social Sciences, EHESS).The sociology and political orientation of many French Catholics may also have something to do with this alleged distance from a pontiff perceived, in some respects, to be leaning further to the left politically than his predecessors. According to an IFOP poll for the newspaper La Croix conducted the day after the first round of the presidential election in April last year, most Catholics said they had voted for candidates ranging from the center to the far right.A civil servant and a mother of a large family, Adélaïde, 43, said she did not feel concerned by Pope Francis. A fervent Catholic and ""legitimist,"" she regrets that the head of the Church is sometimes the subject of bitter criticism. But she still thinks that the themes he tackles are not hers. ""Questions about migrants or the environment are important, but they speak to me much less than the dogmatic themes addressed by Benedict XVI.

Macron's decision to attend Pope Francis' Marseille mass revives debate on secularism,"    The president's decision to be at the pontiff's religious service on Saturday is perceived by the left as a breach of the state's religious neutrality. However, this choice is in line with the actions of his predecessors. ","France's passion for religion has always been ""the first to be kindled and the last to be extinguished,"" according to historian Alexis de Tocqueville. President Emmanuel Macron's plan to attend the huge mass led by Pope Francis on Saturday, September 23 in Marseille has served as a reminder of this in recent days. Invited by the pontiff to attend the religious service he will conduct at the Stade-Vélodrome in front of 57,000 people, the president of the Republic, who maintains friendly relations with the Argentinian pope – he has met him on the same morning for a record fourth time – has decided to attend the ""celebratory moment"" with his wife, the Elysée Palace has said. He was immediately accused by the left-wing opposition of ""trampling"" on the state's religious neutrality.Why are elected officials from La France Insoumise (LFI, radical left), the French Communist Party (PCF) and Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EELV, green party) reacting so strongly to this decision? Because it comes just three weeks after Macron asserted that he would allow ""nothing to pass"" when it came to abayas and khamis, garments now banned in schools in the name of secularism. This decision could be interpreted by some French Muslims as a sign of mistrust towards their faith.On September 15, the head of state responded that he would attend mass as the ""president"" of a secular country, but not as a ""Catholic."" ""The state is neutral, the public services are neutral and we are upholding the same for schools, as we reiterated at the start of the new school year,"" he added, referring to the abaya ban. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne deemed the controversy sparked by the left-wing opposition as ""ridiculous.""The Elysée pointed out that in 1980, former president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was the first to attend a mass by Pope John Paul II on the forecourt of Notre-Dame de Paris, without any objections. ""But back then, the debate on secularism was nowhere near as heated as it has been since the early 2000s,"" said sociologist Philippe Portier, director of studies at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes.Moreover, it is not Macron's first mass as president: he was present at singer Johnny Hallyday's religious funeral at La Madeleine Church in 2017 and at former president Jacques Chirac's at Saint-Sulpice Church in 2019. At the time, ""there was no controversy."" In the first case, however, the young president, who had been elected only a few months earlier, came close to committing a blunder. In front of the cameras, he reached for the aspergillum, used to sprinkle holy water, to bless the singer's coffin – before changing his mind and putting it down.",Religions,frances passion religion always first kindled last extinguished according historian alexis tocqueville president emmanuel macrons plan attend huge mass led pope francis saturday september marseille served reminder recent days invited pontiff attend religious service conduct stade lodrome front people president republic maintains friendly relations argentinian pope met morning record fourth time decided attend celebratory moment wife elys palace said immediately accused left wing opposition trampling states religious neutrality elected officials france insoumise lfi radical left french communist party pcf europe ecologie les verts eelv green party reacting strongly decision comes three weeks macron asserted would allow nothing pass came abayas khamis garments banned schools name secularism decision could interpreted french muslims sign mistrust towards faith september head state responded would attend mass president secular country catholic state neutral public services neutral upholding schools reiterated start new school year added referring abaya ban meanwhile prime minister elisabeth borne deemed controversy sparked left wing opposition ridiculous elys pointed former president val giscard destaing first attend mass pope john paul forecourt notre dame paris without objections back debate secularism nowhere near heated since early said sociologist philippe portier director studies ecole pratique des hautes etudes moreover macrons first mass president present singer johnny hallydays religious funeral madeleine church former president jacques chiracs saint sulpice church time controversy first case however young president elected months earlier came close committing blunder front cameras reached aspergillum used sprinkle holy water bless singers coffin changing mind putting,franc passion religion alway first kindl last extinguish accord historian alexi tocquevil presid emmanuel macron plan attend huge mass led pope franci saturday septemb marseil serv remind recent day invit pontiff attend religi servic conduct stade lodrom front peopl presid republ maintain friendli relat argentinian pope met morn record fourth time decid attend celebratori moment wife eli palac said immedi accus left wing opposit trampl state religi neutral elect offici franc insoumis lfi radic left french communist parti pcf europ ecologi le vert eelv green parti react strongli decis come three week macron assert would allow noth pass came abaya khami garment ban school name secular decis could interpret french muslim sign mistrust toward faith septemb head state respond would attend mass presid secular countri cathol state neutral public servic neutral uphold school reiter start new school year ad refer abaya ban meanwhil prime minist elisabeth born deem controversi spark left wing opposit ridicul eli point former presid val giscard desta first attend mass pope john paul forecourt notr dame pari without object back debat secular nowher near heat sinc earli said sociologist philipp portier director studi ecol pratiqu de haut etud moreov macron first mass presid present singer johnni hallyday religi funer madelein church former presid jacqu chirac saint sulpic church time controversi first case howev young presid elect month earlier came close commit blunder front camera reach aspergillum use sprinkl holi water bless singer coffin chang mind put
Pope Francis leads tens of thousands in mass at Marseille stadium,"    According to the local authorities, there were 50,000 people in the stadium while 100,000 had lined the streets during the popemobile's tour. ","Pope Francis on Saturday, September 23, led tens of thousands of worshippers packed into a stadium for a mass in Marseille after earlier striding into a politically loaded debate in the French Mediterranean city by urging European states not to treat migrants as invaders. The visit by Francis has been shadowed by the controversy over migrant arrivals in Europe, and his plea to welcome people puts him at odds with most EU governments in countries including Italy and France.But the centrepiece of the visit was the mass at Marseille's main stadium the Velodrome – usually the venue for rugby or football matches. The Pope received huge cheers as he closed the service, asking the faithful in French to ""pray for me, it's a difficult job"" his favored parting line.Marseille archbishop Jean-Marc Aveline declared that the pope had been ""baptized as a citizen of Marseille"", again drawing an ovation from the crowd. The pontiff's visit to the Velodrome was ""as if you went to every Marseille person's home,"" Aveline added.Francis had entered the stadium aboard his popemobile after being driven at walking pace in the open-top vehicle through the streets of the city to receive the greetings of residents waving Vatican and French flags. Clutches of black- or white-robed priests and nuns were scattered through the crowds during the service, while volunteers distributed communion wafers.Fans of the much-loved Olympique de Marseille football team lifted up a giant banner of a smiling Francis and the hilltop basilica of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde, which he visited on Friday.According to local authorities, there were 50,000 people in the stadium while 100,000 had lined the streets during the pope's tour.Worshippers cheered when Aveline thanked the pontiff for his ""powerful and courageous words"" on immigration, in an apparent rebuke to French President Emmanuel Macron, present in the stadium, whose government plans to toughen up controls on migrants. The pope's forceful interventions came as the migration debate has been stoked by mass arrivals on the Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month.A French presidential official said that Macron and the pope had discussed migration in bilateral talks earlier. ""France has nothing to be embarrassed about, it's a country of welcome and integration,"" the official said.Francis and the president were set to speak again at Marseille airport before the pontiff's departure.Some politicians on the left have criticised Macron's decision to attend Saturday's mass as an infringement of state secularism. Others on the right have attacked Francis for interfering in domestic politics.The French presidential official said that Macron discussed the ""methodology"" and ""calendar"" the right to abortion in the constitution. Old people risk being ""pushed aside, under the false pretences of a supposedly dignified and 'sweet' death that is more 'salty' than the waters of the sea"", Francis warned. He also spoke of ""unborn children, rejected in the name of a false right to progress, which is instead a retreat into the selfish needs of the individual"".The French presidential official said that Macron discussed the ""methodology"" and the ""calendar"" of a bill on assisted dying e that the government wants to present to parliament in the next weeks.",Religions,pope francis saturday september led tens thousands worshippers packed stadium mass marseille earlier striding politically loaded debate french mediterranean city urging european states treat migrants invaders visit francis shadowed controversy migrant arrivals europe plea welcome people puts odds governments countries including italy france centrepiece visit mass marseilles main stadium velodrome usually venue rugby football matches pope received huge cheers closed service asking faithful french pray difficult job favored parting line marseille archbishop jean marc aveline declared pope baptized citizen marseille drawing ovation crowd pontiffs visit velodrome went every marseille persons home aveline added francis entered stadium aboard popemobile driven walking pace open top vehicle streets city receive greetings residents waving vatican french flags clutches black white robed priests nuns scattered crowds service volunteers distributed communion wafers fans much loved olympique marseille football team lifted giant banner smiling francis hilltop basilica notre dame garde visited friday according local authorities people stadium lined streets popes tour worshippers cheered aveline thanked pontiff powerful courageous words immigration apparent rebuke french president emmanuel macron present stadium whose government plans toughen controls migrants popes forceful interventions came migration debate stoked mass arrivals italian island lampedusa earlier month french presidential official said macron pope discussed migration bilateral talks earlier france nothing embarrassed country welcome integration official said francis president set speak marseille airport pontiffs departure politicians left criticised macrons decision attend saturdays mass infringement state secularism others right attacked francis interfering domestic politics french presidential official said macron discussed methodology calendar right abortion constitution old people risk pushed aside false pretences supposedly dignified sweet death salty waters sea francis warned also spoke unborn children rejected name false right progress instead retreat selfish needs individual french presidential official said macron discussed methodology calendar bill assisted dying government wants present parliament next weeks,pope franci saturday septemb led ten thousand worshipp pack stadium mass marseil earlier stride polit load debat french mediterranean citi urg european state treat migrant invad visit franci shadow controversi migrant arriv europ plea welcom peopl put odd govern countri includ itali franc centrepiec visit mass marseil main stadium velodrom usual venu rugbi footbal match pope receiv huge cheer close servic ask faith french pray difficult job favor part line marseil archbishop jean marc avelin declar pope baptiz citizen marseil draw ovat crowd pontiff visit velodrom went everi marseil person home avelin ad franci enter stadium aboard popemobil driven walk pace open top vehicl street citi receiv greet resid wave vatican french flag clutch black white robe priest nun scatter crowd servic volunt distribut communion wafer fan much love olympiqu marseil footbal team lift giant banner smile franci hilltop basilica notr dame gard visit friday accord local author peopl stadium line street pope tour worshipp cheer avelin thank pontiff power courag word immigr appar rebuk french presid emmanuel macron present stadium whose govern plan toughen control migrant pope forc intervent came migrat debat stoke mass arriv italian island lampedusa earlier month french presidenti offici said macron pope discuss migrat bilater talk earlier franc noth embarrass countri welcom integr offici said franci presid set speak marseil airport pontiff departur politician left criticis macron decis attend saturday mass infring state secular other right attack franci interf domest polit french presidenti offici said macron discuss methodolog calendar right abort constitut old peopl risk push asid fals pretenc supposedli dignifi sweet death salti water sea franci warn also spoke unborn children reject name fals right progress instead retreat selfish need individu french presidenti offici said macron discuss methodolog calendar bill assist die govern want present parliament next week
'The pope's stardom is a recent phenomenon',    Why does the Church still fascinate us? Historian Alain Rauwel analyzes the Church's social role and influence as Pope Francis visited Marseille on September 22-23. ,"Alain Rauwel is a medieval historian specializing in the Latin Church at the University of Burgundy, Dijon. With philosopher Frédéric Gabriel and historian Dominique Iogna-Prat, he directed the collective work Dictionnaire critique de l'Eglise (""Critical Church Dictionary"") for which he wrote the introduction. As Pope Francis visited Marseille on September 22-23, he analyzes the Church's social role and influence.The ecclesial community is not simply a community of faith characterized by shared beliefs: it's a way of establishing a community that involves individuals and groups in all their dimensions, which has strongly permeated our Western societies.Take, for example, the question of parenthood. Compared to many ancient societies, where kinship was based exclusively on blood, the great novelty of the ecclesial system is that it has introduced a vocabulary and rules of kinship on many scales, to the point of introducing a universal form of parenthood. According to the Bible, aren't we all ""brothers"" before a ""Father""? Our modern vision of fraternity, which goes beyond blood ties to become part of the Republican motto [in France], is thus part of the history of the Church.In the introduction, I refer to [sociologist] Emile Durkheim (1858-1917), who argued that the term ""Church"" could be applied to any ""moral community built upon a system of beliefs and practices."" We considered this open-ended definition to be a good starting point.Initially, the notion of Christianity was linked to controversial contexts. One of the key moments in its structuring came during the Crusades: Various authors' use of this term was not so much a response to the need to define oneself as against ""others."" Gradually, however, the idea emerged of a society in which Christianity would become a total norm and in which all forms of life – not only religious but also political, familial, economic, etc. – would be governed by principles considered to be Christian, under the control of an instituted Church.In the 1930s-1940s-1950s, however, some people called for a ""return to Christianity,"" even though the word had gradually fallen into disuse after the Renaissance. Just think of the philosopher Jacques Maritain (1882-1973), who wrote in 1958: ""Not only is a new Christendom possible, but it constitutes the meeting point of all the energies at work in history since the disintegration of the Middle Ages.""",Religions,alain rauwel medieval historian specializing latin church university burgundy dijon philosopher ric gabriel historian dominique iogna prat directed collective work dictionnaire critique leglise critical church dictionary wrote introduction pope francis visited marseille september analyzes churchs social role influence ecclesial community simply community faith characterized shared beliefs way establishing community involves individuals groups dimensions strongly permeated western societies take example question parenthood compared many ancient societies kinship based exclusively blood great novelty ecclesial system introduced vocabulary rules kinship many scales point introducing universal form parenthood according bible arent brothers father modern vision fraternity goes beyond blood ties become part republican motto france thus part history church introduction refer sociologist emile durkheim argued term church could applied moral community built upon system beliefs practices considered open ended definition good starting point initially notion christianity linked controversial contexts one key moments structuring came crusades various authors use term much response need define oneself others gradually however idea emerged society christianity would become total norm forms life religious also political familial economic etc would governed principles considered christian control instituted church however people called return christianity even though word gradually fallen disuse renaissance think philosopher jacques maritain wrote new christendom possible constitutes meeting point energies work history since disintegration middle ages,alain rauwel mediev historian special latin church univers burgundi dijon philosoph ric gabriel historian dominiqu iogna prat direct collect work dictionnair critiqu leglis critic church dictionari wrote introduct pope franci visit marseil septemb analyz church social role influenc ecclesi commun simpli commun faith character share belief way establish commun involv individu group dimens strongli permeat western societi take exampl question parenthood compar mani ancient societi kinship base exclus blood great novelti ecclesi system introduc vocabulari rule kinship mani scale point introduc univers form parenthood accord bibl arent brother father modern vision fratern goe beyond blood tie becom part republican motto franc thu part histori church introduct refer sociologist emil durkheim argu term church could appli moral commun built upon system belief practic consid open end definit good start point initi notion christian link controversi context one key moment structur came crusad variou author use term much respons need defin oneself other gradual howev idea emerg societi christian would becom total norm form life religi also polit famili econom etc would govern principl consid christian control institut church howev peopl call return christian even though word gradual fallen disus renaiss think philosoph jacqu maritain wrote new christendom possibl constitut meet point energi work histori sinc disintegr middl age
What is a synod and what makes this one historic?,"    The plenary council for the Synod on the future of the Church opens in Rome on October 4. Launched two years ago, it is set to decide on some of the most taboo subjects in the Catholic world. Here are four questions to help you understand what's at stake. ","The Catholic Church may have reached a decisive juncture in its long history. The general assembly of the Synod on the future of the Church, sometimes dubbed the ""Synod on Synodality,"" will take place in Rome from October 4 to 29. The agenda, unveiled in July by the Vatican, includes some of the most taboo subjects in the Catholic world, including the governance of the Church, the status of priests, women's role in the Church, welcoming remarried divorcees and LGBT+ people and sexuality.The assembly in Rome will be the last stage of a vast process launched in 2021 by Pope Francis, during which the faithful in dioceses around the world were called upon to voice their opinions on the Church's future. It should be followed by a new general assembly in Rome in the fall of 2024, which will discuss possible follow-ups and most likely a final text from the pontiff.In October 2023, 365 persons from every continent will be meeting to discuss these issues, including 96 non-bishops and 54 women. While this contemporary version of the Catholic synod features many new aspects, it is part of the long history of synodality, a term that has not always meant the same thing but whose goals have remained more or less the same over the centuries: To answer the question of who should make the major decisions within the Church, in a careful balancing act between ""God's people,"" the pope and the prelates.Etymologically, the word first appeared in a Christian context and probably comes from the combination of the Greek words sun and odos, which, put together, mean ""to journey together."" According to tradition, synodical practice is inspired by the biblical accounts of Pentecost or the famous ""Jerusalem assembly,"" when, according to the Acts of the Apostles, the first Christians, starting with Peter and Paul, debated the status of non-Jewish converts.The term ""synodos"" first appeared in the writings of Dionysius of Alexandria, who used it to designate Christian assemblies in Iconium and Synnada (present-day Turkey) that were held around 230. But its meaning was still unclear. In the writings of some Church Fathers, the word was sometimes used to designate the Church as a whole or even, as in the writings of John Chrysostom (c. 344-407), any gathering of the faithful practicing the Eucharist.The term gradually came to refer to the assemblies of the faithful debating the future of their community, which emerged from the earliest days of Christianity, mainly in Palestine and Asia Minor, and often under the aegis of one or more ""episkopoi"" (from which ""évêque,"" the French word for bishop, comes from). These guardians of the dogma were recognized by the faithful as possessing special gifts justifying their authority. The first proceedings (convocation, conduct of debates, consultation, and so on) documented by Bishop Cyprian of Carthage (circa 200-258) attest to the direct influence of the debates at work in the Roman Senate or the municipal councils of the empire's provincial capitals.",Religions,catholic church may reached decisive juncture long history general assembly synod future church sometimes dubbed synod synodality take place rome october agenda unveiled july vatican includes taboo subjects catholic world including governance church status priests womens role church welcoming remarried divorcees lgbt people sexuality assembly rome last stage vast process launched pope francis faithful dioceses around world called upon voice opinions churchs future followed new general assembly rome fall discuss possible follow ups likely final text pontiff october persons every continent meeting discuss issues including non bishops women contemporary version catholic synod features many new aspects part long history synodality term always meant thing whose goals remained less centuries answer question make major decisions within church careful balancing act gods people pope prelates etymologically word first appeared christian context probably comes combination greek words sun odos put together mean journey together according tradition synodical practice inspired biblical accounts pentecost famous jerusalem assembly according acts apostles first christians starting peter paul debated status non jewish converts term synodos first appeared writings dionysius alexandria used designate christian assemblies iconium synnada present day turkey held around meaning still unclear writings church fathers word sometimes used designate church whole even writings john chrysostom gathering faithful practicing eucharist term gradually came refer assemblies faithful debating future community emerged earliest days christianity mainly palestine asia minor often aegis one episkopoi que french word bishop comes guardians dogma recognized faithful possessing special gifts justifying authority first proceedings convocation conduct debates consultation documented bishop cyprian carthage circa attest direct influence debates work roman senate municipal councils empires provincial capitals,cathol church may reach decis junctur long histori gener assembl synod futur church sometim dub synod synod take place rome octob agenda unveil juli vatican includ taboo subject cathol world includ govern church statu priest women role church welcom remarri divorce lgbt peopl sexual assembl rome last stage vast process launch pope franci faith dioces around world call upon voic opinion church futur follow new gener assembl rome fall discuss possibl follow up like final text pontiff octob person everi contin meet discuss issu includ non bishop women contemporari version cathol synod featur mani new aspect part long histori synod term alway meant thing whose goal remain less centuri answer question make major decis within church care balanc act god peopl pope prelat etymolog word first appear christian context probabl come combin greek word sun odo put togeth mean journey togeth accord tradit synod practic inspir biblic account pentecost famou jerusalem assembl accord act apostl first christian start peter paul debat statu non jewish convert term synodo first appear write dionysiu alexandria use design christian assembl iconium synnada present day turkey held around mean still unclear write church father word sometim use design church whole even write john chrysostom gather faith practic eucharist term gradual came refer assembl faith debat futur commun emerg earliest day christian mainli palestin asia minor often aegi one episkopoi que french word bishop come guardian dogma recogn faith possess special gift justifi author first proceed convoc conduct debat consult document bishop cyprian carthag circa attest direct influenc debat work roman senat municip council empir provinci capit
Pope Francis warns against 'ideological battles' on first day of Catholic Church synod,    The staging and organization of the first day of this meeting of bishops and laypeople in Rome on Wednesday were intended to encourage greater equality in the institution. ,"They marched in procession through St. Peter's Square, one behind the other. Laity and clergy, members of the general assembly of the ""synod on synodality,"" arrived together on Wednesday, October 4, for the opening mass of this major meeting that could change the future of the Catholic Church. It was like a carefully staged representation of the place laypeople could take in Pope Francis' Church, which he dreams will be more horizontal.At the pope's request, these synod delegates will spend four weeks discussing the many questions put to them by the faithful from all over the world, who have also been encouraged by the pontiff to give their opinion on how the institution should function. Church governance, the ordination of married men, the place of women and the laity, and the management of sexual violence committed by members of the clergy: There will be many burning issues on the menu of this first assembly, which is to be followed by a second in October 2024.Historic because it could change the way the Church conducts itself, this event – which should serve to give shape to Francis' legacy – is also historic because of the composition of its members, where clerics (more numerous) and laypeople appear to be given equal power. For the first time, it's not just bishops who have to meet and vote on resolutions. Alongside them are laypeople, including women, who marched like the others in St. Peter's Square on Wednesday, as the litany of saints resounded.For the first time, too, the members of the assembly are not meeting in the usual amphitheater-style synod venue, but in the enormous Paul VI Hall in the Vatican. They took their seats on Wednesday morning to get used to the new organization. Gone were the sloping bleachers where people would have been seated according to their rank. This time, laity and clerics together, organized in small linguistic groups, took their places around round tables without any hierarchy. It was another symbol of the equality and horizontality between clerics and laity Francis wanted for this event, but also within the Church. Sitting at the presiding table, itself barely higher than the others, the pope himself took part in this display of horizontality. A few minutes before the opening, Francis went into the middle of the crowd of participants, chatting with some and hugging others.Between the image of a united Church that has come together to ""journey"" (the etymological meaning of the word ""synod"") in order to reflect and discuss its future, and the reality for the Church, however, there is a gulf. Outside Vatican territory, the divisions were already coming to the fore before the synod's work had even begun.",Religions,marched procession peters square one behind laity clergy members general assembly synod synodality arrived together wednesday october opening mass major meeting could change future catholic church like carefully staged representation place laypeople could take pope francis church dreams horizontal popes request synod delegates spend four weeks discussing many questions put faithful world also encouraged pontiff give opinion institution function church governance ordination married men place women laity management sexual violence committed members clergy many burning issues menu first assembly followed second october historic could change way church conducts event serve give shape francis legacy also historic composition members clerics numerous laypeople appear given equal power first time bishops meet vote resolutions alongside laypeople including women marched like others peters square wednesday litany saints resounded first time members assembly meeting usual amphitheater style synod venue enormous paul hall vatican took seats wednesday morning get used new organization gone sloping bleachers people would seated according rank time laity clerics together organized small linguistic groups took places around round tables without hierarchy another symbol equality horizontality clerics laity francis wanted event also within church sitting presiding table barely higher others pope took part display horizontality minutes opening francis went middle crowd participants chatting hugging others image united church come together journey etymological meaning word synod order reflect discuss future reality church however gulf outside vatican territory divisions already coming fore synods work even begun,march process peter squar one behind laiti clergi member gener assembl synod synod arriv togeth wednesday octob open mass major meet could chang futur cathol church like care stage represent place laypeopl could take pope franci church dream horizont pope request synod deleg spend four week discuss mani question put faith world also encourag pontiff give opinion institut function church govern ordin marri men place women laiti manag sexual violenc commit member clergi mani burn issu menu first assembl follow second octob histor could chang way church conduct event serv give shape franci legaci also histor composit member cleric numer laypeopl appear given equal power first time bishop meet vote resolut alongsid laypeopl includ women march like other peter squar wednesday litani saint resound first time member assembl meet usual amphitheat style synod venu enorm paul hall vatican took seat wednesday morn get use new organ gone slope bleacher peopl would seat accord rank time laiti cleric togeth organ small linguist group took place around round tabl without hierarchi anoth symbol equal horizont cleric laiti franci want event also within church sit presid tabl bare higher other pope took part display horizont minut open franci went middl crowd particip chat hug other imag unit church come togeth journey etymolog mean word synod order reflect discuss futur realiti church howev gulf outsid vatican territori divis alreadi come fore synod work even begun
"'The sermon I didn't want to write,' by Delphine Horvilleur","    In her Yom Kippur sermon on September 24, 2023, the rabbi delivered an uncompromising critique of the policies pursued by Benjamin Netanyahu's government in Israel.

","Two weeks before the Hamas attacks in Israel, Delphine Horvilleur gave a sermon in Paris to mark the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. ""Worried,"" as she recounted in an interview with Le Monde after the October 7 attacks, by the political landscape in the country, led by an extreme right-wing government, the rabbi had decided to evoke ""this political issue, this threat hanging over Israel in its illusion of omnipotence"" in her sermon. ""When I wrote my Yom Kippur sermon three weeks ago, I had no idea how it would resonate almost immediately,"" she told Le Monde. Here are the main extracts from her sermon.Document.

Not only because it's the day of great forgiveness, but for a simpler reason, which I could state in a single sentence: I tried, really tried not to write the sermon you're about to hear.

"Delphine Horvilleur: 'Faced with the Hamas murders, some silences have left me devastated'",Interview,"Le Monde met with rabbi Delphine Horvilleur in her Paris synagogue after she celebrated two bar mitzvahs in a seemingly joyful atmosphere. ""I didn't want to steal such an important moment in these teenagers' lives. A bar mitzvah is a celebratory occasion, not a day for the dead,"" said Horvilleur, a leading figure in liberal Judaism in France. However, in the audience, tearful faces hinted at the dramatic context, a few days after Hamas' deadly attack in Israel. In the face of tragedy, the rabbi called for us not to succumb ""to an absolute dehumanization of the other side.""Delphine Horvilleur: It's hard for me to answer this question because it depends on the time of day. Like many people, I'm devastated and have become totally pessimistic, even though I've always seen myself as an optimist, confident in the possibility of peace. Today, these lofty ideals now ring a little hollow to me. I feel like the ground has given way beneath my feet, like something has collapsed.I could speak as a Jew or as someone connected to Israel, of course. But in reality, I simply have to speak as a human being. We are confronted with images of such inhumanity that the question that fills my mind is how to preserve our humanity, how to make sure that, in the times to come, we don't dehumanize the other to a degree that would confiscate our souls.As much as I can understand that in the Middle East people no longer manage to do it because the level of hatred and rage has reached its peak, we have no excuse here. And I feel anger towards those people from France, who add hatred to hatred and who sink into an absolute dehumanization of the other side. This major empathic flaw is, in fact, a terrible moral flaw, and its repercussion will be the dehumanization of ourselves. It will further enclose us within a bubble of selective empathy, an impossible trust in the words of others because they were not there. We have a duty, from a distance, to be the ultimate guardians of humanity, despite our rage and anger, in the moral necessity of denouncing in the strongest possible terms what has just happened. No cause, no matter how just, legitimizes these crimes by Hamas. No freedom or emancipation can be achieved on the basis of this ignominy.",Religions,monde met rabbi delphine horvilleur paris synagogue celebrated two bar mitzvahs seemingly joyful atmosphere didnt want steal important moment teenagers lives bar mitzvah celebratory occasion day dead said horvilleur leading figure liberal judaism france however audience tearful faces hinted dramatic context days hamas deadly attack israel face tragedy rabbi called succumb absolute dehumanization side delphine horvilleur hard answer question depends time day like many people devastated become totally pessimistic even though ive always seen optimist confident possibility peace today lofty ideals ring little hollow feel like ground given way beneath feet like something collapsed could speak jew someone connected israel course reality simply speak human confronted images inhumanity question fills mind preserve humanity make sure times come dont dehumanize degree would confiscate souls much understand middle east people longer manage level hatred rage reached peak excuse feel anger towards people france add hatred hatred sink absolute dehumanization side major empathic flaw fact terrible moral flaw repercussion dehumanization enclose within bubble selective empathy impossible trust words others duty distance ultimate guardians humanity despite rage anger moral necessity denouncing strongest possible terms happened cause matter legitimizes crimes hamas freedom emancipation achieved basis ignominy,mond met rabbi delphin horvilleur pari synagogu celebr two bar mitzvah seemingli joy atmospher didnt want steal import moment teenag live bar mitzvah celebratori occas day dead said horvilleur lead figur liber judaism franc howev audienc tear face hint dramat context day hama deadli attack israel face tragedi rabbi call succumb absolut dehuman side delphin horvilleur hard answer question depend time day like mani peopl devast becom total pessimist even though ive alway seen optimist confid possibl peac today lofti ideal ring littl hollow feel like ground given way beneath feet like someth collaps could speak jew someon connect israel cours realiti simpli speak human confront imag inhuman question fill mind preserv human make sure time come dont dehuman degre would confisc soul much understand middl east peopl longer manag level hatr rage reach peak excus feel anger toward peopl franc add hatr hatr sink absolut dehuman side major empath flaw fact terribl moral flaw repercuss dehuman enclos within bubbl select empathi imposs trust word other duti distanc ultim guardian human despit rage anger moral necess denounc strongest possibl term happen caus matter legitim crime hama freedom emancip achiev basi ignomini
'The Quran does not give carte blanche to commit violence',"In an op-ed, eight Muslim academics, researchers and intellectuals, including the professor of social psychology Marwan Sinaceur at the ESSEC Business School, write why terrorism revolts them, and how contrary it is to Islam's values.","Three years after Samuel Paty's murder, we are once again faced with a terrorist murder that affects the heart of France's civilian life – the school. Dominique Bernard was a teacher, who voluntarily put himself in the way to save lives. He loved his job passionately. He paid for it with his life.We want to say to the murderer, to this terrorist who claims to be Muslim – to all terrorists who claim to be Muslim – that murder, whatever the circumstances, is inexcusable. Life, all life, is sacred. No one has the right to take life and to break up families. Dominique Bernard was married with three daughters. Who can replace a husband and father?Every joy has been taken away forever, leaving nothing but suffering forever. To the barbaric murderer who claims to speak in the name of our religion, we say what the Quran says about the value of life: ""Do not attempt to take another human being's life, which God made sacred.""(Quran, 17:33). And again: ""Whoever slays a human being not convicted of murder (...) is considered the slayer of all mankind. Whoever saves the life of a single human being is considered to have saved the life of all mankind!"" (Quran, 5:32).And again, in the words of Abel to Cain: ""And if you lay your hand on me to kill me, I will not do the same, for I fear my Lord, the master of the universe, too much to commit such a crime!"" (Quran, 5:28). It's obvious that killing is a crime, and these verses make that quite clear: To fear God requires us to respect the life of others, to respect others.To Dominique Bernard's murderer, who claims to be a Muslim, we also want to quote a famous Hadith [words attributed to the Prophet]: ""The ink of scholars is more sacred than the blood of martyrs,"" and therefore, every teacher represents knowledge. We would like to emphasize that the Islamic civilization was built on philosophy and science; on the thirst for knowledge and on the thirst for learning. And that this thirst is not limited by cultural boundaries: All knowledge and all learning whatever the field, whatever the cultural origin is light, enrichment and fulfillment.The Quran calls on us to make use of our understanding and reason, both in observing nature and in reflecting on life. Reason is not an obstacle to faith in Islam, but a necessary condition of it (Quran, 2:44; 3:190; 10:5; 16:12-13; 16:67; 20:54 and 45:5). And terrorists and would-be terrorists must also be reminded that the Quran recognizes the divergence of viewpoints and identities throughout the world (Quran, 22:67; 30:22; 10:19; 11:118). In Islam, God intended a diversity of viewpoints and cultures (Quran, 7:168).",Religions,three years samuel patys murder faced terrorist murder affects heart frances civilian life school dominique bernard teacher voluntarily put way save lives loved job passionately paid life want say murderer terrorist claims muslim terrorists claim muslim murder whatever circumstances inexcusable life life sacred one right take life break families dominique bernard married three daughters replace husband father every joy taken away forever leaving nothing suffering forever barbaric murderer claims speak name religion say quran says value life attempt take another human beings life god made sacred quran whoever slays human convicted murder considered slayer mankind whoever saves life single human considered saved life mankind quran words abel cain lay hand kill fear lord master universe much commit crime quran obvious killing crime verses make quite clear fear god requires respect life others respect others dominique bernards murderer claims muslim also want quote famous hadith words attributed prophet ink scholars sacred blood martyrs therefore every teacher represents knowledge would like emphasize islamic civilization built philosophy science thirst knowledge thirst learning thirst limited cultural boundaries knowledge learning whatever field whatever cultural origin light enrichment fulfillment quran calls make use understanding reason observing nature reflecting life reason obstacle faith islam necessary condition quran terrorists would terrorists must also reminded quran recognizes divergence viewpoints identities throughout world quran islam god intended diversity viewpoints cultures quran,three year samuel pati murder face terrorist murder affect heart franc civilian life school dominiqu bernard teacher voluntarili put way save live love job passion paid life want say murder terrorist claim muslim terrorist claim muslim murder whatev circumst inexcus life life sacr one right take life break famili dominiqu bernard marri three daughter replac husband father everi joy taken away forev leav noth suffer forev barbar murder claim speak name religion say quran say valu life attempt take anoth human be life god made sacr quran whoever slay human convict murder consid slayer mankind whoever save life singl human consid save life mankind quran word abel cain lay hand kill fear lord master univers much commit crime quran obviou kill crime vers make quit clear fear god requir respect life other respect other dominiqu bernard murder claim muslim also want quot famou hadith word attribut prophet ink scholar sacr blood martyr therefor everi teacher repres knowledg would like emphas islam civil built philosophi scienc thirst knowledg thirst learn thirst limit cultur boundari knowledg learn whatev field whatev cultur origin light enrich fulfil quran call make use understand reason observ natur reflect life reason obstacl faith islam necessari condit quran terrorist would terrorist must also remind quran recogn diverg viewpoint ident throughout world quran islam god intend divers viewpoint cultur quran
Israel-Hamas war: 'Holding to a religious interpretation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict prevents any understanding or solution',"It is more essential than ever to reject the rhetoric of fundamentalism and take a historical approach to this conflict, writes historian Stéphanie Laithier.","Since the morning of October 7, when Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched their joint attack on the Jewish state, Israelis and the wider world have been stunned and horrified by the scale of the massacre perpetrated by these two Palestinian movements.Stunned by the apparent ease with which the terrorists infiltrated Israeli territory and then spread to various locations in the South; horrified at the hundreds of civilians and soldiers killed or seriously wounded – some with their throats slit, mutilated or burned alive in their own homes. In addition to these victims, there are those who have been taken to the Gaza Strip: Women, men and children displayed on social media by their captors as macabre trophies.In Israel, shock, fear and anger continue unabated. The determination to annihilate the Hamas aggressors is strong and widely supported by a traumatized population. At a time when the retaliatory strikes have already caused over 7,300 deaths [according to the Hamas-governed Gaza Ministry of Health], we are entering yet another episode in a spiral of war.However, given the shock felt in Israel and in a part of the world at the nature of this aggression, as well as the thinly veiled involvement of other regional forces, this new stage could well prove to have even harsher consequences for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, as well as encouraging a general upheaval.At the same time, in many countries, some are at pains to condemn the atrocities committed by the terrorists and sometimes even find justifications for them, unable as they are to recognize that these crimes transcend all allegiances to reach our very humanity. The unambiguous condemnation of these crimes is, however, an indisputable condition for any future attempt to implement a resolution to the conflict that is acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians. The Palestinian cause has been dishonored by these heinous acts, and the support it rightfully receives surely deserves better than procrastination or indifference in the face of horror.Of course, we can call into question successive Israeli governments' policies over the last few years, and the decisions taken by ministerial teams which seem to have contributed to compromising the security of their own citizens. We can also examine the reasons behind the failure to resolve this conflict and the resulting loss of hope in Palestinian society.We must not, however, find excuses for barbarity. Let us also not forget that while recent events have pushed the Israeli people into a major crisis, they also represent a political, social and humanitarian catastrophe for the entire Palestinian population, beyond the media proclamations of Islamist activists and their supporters.",Religions,since morning october hamas islamic jihad launched joint attack jewish state israelis wider world stunned horrified scale massacre perpetrated two palestinian movements stunned apparent ease terrorists infiltrated israeli territory spread various locations south horrified hundreds civilians soldiers killed seriously wounded throats slit mutilated burned alive homes addition victims taken gaza strip women men children displayed social media captors macabre trophies israel shock fear anger continue unabated determination annihilate hamas aggressors strong widely supported traumatized population time retaliatory strikes already caused deaths according hamas governed gaza ministry health entering yet another episode spiral war however given shock felt israel part world nature aggression well thinly veiled involvement regional forces new stage could well prove even harsher consequences palestinian israeli peoples well encouraging general upheaval time many countries pains condemn atrocities committed terrorists sometimes even find justifications unable recognize crimes transcend allegiances reach humanity unambiguous condemnation crimes however indisputable condition future attempt implement resolution conflict acceptable israelis palestinians palestinian cause dishonored heinous acts support rightfully receives surely deserves better procrastination indifference face horror course call question successive israeli governments policies last years decisions taken ministerial teams seem contributed compromising security citizens also examine reasons behind failure resolve conflict resulting loss hope palestinian society must however find excuses barbarity let also forget recent events pushed israeli people major crisis also represent political social humanitarian catastrophe entire palestinian population beyond media proclamations islamist activists supporters,sinc morn octob hama islam jihad launch joint attack jewish state isra wider world stun horrifi scale massacr perpetr two palestinian movement stun appar eas terrorist infiltr isra territori spread variou locat south horrifi hundr civilian soldier kill serious wound throat slit mutil burn aliv home addit victim taken gaza strip women men children display social media captor macabr trophi israel shock fear anger continu unab determin annihil hama aggressor strong wide support traumat popul time retaliatori strike alreadi caus death accord hama govern gaza ministri health enter yet anoth episod spiral war howev given shock felt israel part world natur aggress well thinli veil involv region forc new stage could well prove even harsher consequ palestinian isra peopl well encourag gener upheav time mani countri pain condemn atroc commit terrorist sometim even find justif unabl recogn crime transcend allegi reach human unambigu condemn crime howev indisput condit futur attempt implement resolut conflict accept isra palestinian palestinian caus dishonor heinou act support right receiv sure deserv better procrastin indiffer face horror cours call question success isra govern polici last year decis taken ministeri team seem contribut compromis secur citizen also examin reason behind failur resolv conflict result loss hope palestinian societi must howev find excus barbar let also forget recent event push isra peopl major crisi also repres polit social humanitarian catastroph entir palestinian popul beyond media proclam islamist activist support
Women's place in the Church is at the heart of synod's first report on institution's future,    The first general assembly of the Synod on Synodality delivered its report on October 28. The question of women and LGBTQ+ inclusion provoked disagreement. Decisions will be made at the second meeting in October 2024. ,"Two years to change the Church. Two years during which delegates – bishops and laypeople from all over the world – were invited by the pope to meet in Rome in October to discuss, debate and perhaps decide on major, even historic, changes in the operations of the Catholic Church. At around 9 pm on Saturday, October 28, the first general assembly of the synod on the future of the Church, or Synod on Synodality, came to a close. This is a major process of reflection on the future of an institution to which 1.3 billion people around the world belong.It was the first step of an effort that will not be completed until October 2024. For four weeks, from October 4 to 29, the 365 members of this first session worked on the life of the Church and how to anchor it more firmly in today's world. The aim, among others, was to better address the existential challenges of a lack of vocations and the desertion of the faithful in certain parts of the world, as well as the enormous crisis of sexual violence committed by priests around the globe.The place of women in the institution, the inclusion of LGBTQ+ people, greater lay participation in decision-making bodies and the fight against clericalism (the excessive place of clerics in the institution) are just some of the subjects on the menu of the delegates's working document, produced through a worldwide consultation of the faithful.It was in the large Paul VI Audience Hall, seated at round tables marking the equality of all, that the synod ""fathers"" and ""mothers"" worked to arrive at the document approved on Saturday evening. For the first time, laypeople, including women (54 out of the 365 members of the session), took part not only in the drafting of the text but also in its adoption, on an equal footing with bishops and even cardinals. This gave substance to the profound change of culture Pope Francis has sought in a Church he would like to see more open to discussion and dialogue.Divided into 18 chapters and 41 pages long, the synthesis report published in Italian on Saturday evening, which the churches will have to take on, does not yet contain any decisions. Each theme is divided into three parts: convergences, proposals and matters for consideration. While the aim of the whole process was to introduce a new way of discussing together and governing the Church, the topics addressed were much broader.Unsurprisingly, it was the themes related to the role of women that dominated the debates over the four weeks. In an atmosphere of nonetheless calm discussion, differences and opposing viewpoints emerged on a subject that remains particularly sensitive today. Women, their place and their role, certainly perceived differently depending on the continent, were also brought up throughout the world in the consultation of the faithful. Today, it was the chapters concerning them that, although adopted, received the most ""no"" votes.",Religions,two years change church two years delegates bishops laypeople world invited pope meet rome october discuss debate perhaps decide major even historic changes operations catholic church around saturday october first general assembly synod future church synod synodality came close major process reflection future institution billion people around world belong first step effort completed october four weeks october members first session worked life church anchor firmly todays world aim among others better address existential challenges lack vocations desertion faithful certain parts world well enormous crisis sexual violence committed priests around globe place women institution inclusion lgbtq people greater lay participation decision making bodies fight clericalism excessive place clerics institution subjects menu delegatess working document produced worldwide consultation faithful large paul audience hall seated round tables marking equality synod fathers mothers worked arrive document approved saturday evening first time laypeople including women members session took part drafting text also adoption equal footing bishops even cardinals gave substance profound change culture pope francis sought church would like see open discussion dialogue divided chapters pages long synthesis report published italian saturday evening churches take yet contain decisions theme divided three parts convergences proposals matters consideration aim whole process introduce new way discussing together governing church topics addressed much broader unsurprisingly themes related role women dominated debates four weeks atmosphere nonetheless calm discussion differences opposing viewpoints emerged subject remains particularly sensitive today women place role certainly perceived differently depending continent also brought throughout world consultation faithful today chapters concerning although adopted received votes,two year chang church two year deleg bishop laypeopl world invit pope meet rome octob discuss debat perhap decid major even histor chang oper cathol church around saturday octob first gener assembl synod futur church synod synod came close major process reflect futur institut billion peopl around world belong first step effort complet octob four week octob member first session work life church anchor firmli today world aim among other better address existenti challeng lack vocat desert faith certain part world well enorm crisi sexual violenc commit priest around globe place women institut inclus lgbtq peopl greater lay particip decis make bodi fight cleric excess place cleric institut subject menu delegatess work document produc worldwid consult faith larg paul audienc hall seat round tabl mark equal synod father mother work arriv document approv saturday even first time laypeopl includ women member session took part draft text also adopt equal foot bishop even cardin gave substanc profound chang cultur pope franci sought church would like see open discuss dialogu divid chapter page long synthesi report publish italian saturday even church take yet contain decis theme divid three part converg propos matter consider aim whole process introduc new way discuss togeth govern church topic address much broader unsurprisingli theme relat role women domin debat four week atmospher nonetheless calm discuss differ oppos viewpoint emerg subject remain particularli sensit today women place role certainli perceiv differ depend contin also brought throughout world consult faith today chapter concern although adopt receiv vote
"Paris Mosque rector: 'It is time to choose. Not between Muslims and Jews, but between humanism and horror'",    Chems-Eddine Hafiz expresses his alarm at the place 'enemies of nuance' occupy in public debate. He argues they're incapable of subtlety when the urgent need is to call for an end to the war. ,"There are times, in the life of a nation, when it becomes urgent to reflect before issuing statements that purport to carry absolute truths, when in reality they mask self-serving judgments. We're living in one of those moments. At a time of dangerous and no less dramatic escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it's healthy to keep quiet for a while before spouting purportedly insightful statements that are nonetheless hateful, confusing and disastrously far-reaching.I have chosen to express myself very little in the media. Today, nuanced and intelligent debate is severely overshadowed by the global confusion of the digital age imposed on us by social media, which have become havens for ideological crooks capable of causing devastating excesses. These enemies of nuance are on the verge of achieving a cultural rupture that invokes extremes without any form of subtlety and favors the pursuit of an ideological agenda over the search for truth.Let's get into the heart of the matter and into the fog of idea association in which we find ourselves. Denouncing anti-Semitism in France would mean renouncing the fundamental rights of all peoples on Earth, including the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. To warn of the rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric would, by the same logic, assimilate you to Islamism. Choose your side. Choose your extreme.So we must explain ourselves, justify ourselves, fight with all our physical and mental strength to save what remains of our fragile humanity: our ability to contradict each other without insulting one another. This is without counting on those enemies of nuance who lie in ambush to assail us with unjust and malicious accusations. There's a manipulative simplification in their approach, which has the ultimate aim of maintaining the climate of conflict that allows them to run rampant for as long as possible.So, according to some of these jokers of French intellectual life, my denunciation of anti-Semitism is a form of taqiya [the act of concealing one's true opinions in order to deceive the enemy]. So here I am, reduced to the racist image of the concealing Muslim, unfit to be a French citizen. What am I hiding? My support for the suffering Palestinian population? It's real, and in that respect, I have nothing to teach the universal human conscience. The images are stronger than my words on the matter. I'm in the camp of all civilian victims and in the camp of peace.Voices are being raised around the world to remind us of the urgency of ending the war and the need for cohabitation between the two states, Palestine and Israel. Muslims in France are subjected to despicable accusations that essentialize them and make them all accomplices in the worst excesses, which are not their own. These accusations are regularly made when some of them – as French citizens resolutely attached to peace and freedom – speak out in favor of an end to the murderous bombardments on Gaza; the protection of all civilian populations, without exception; the release of hostages; free access for humanitarian aid; and the lifting of the blockade on Gaza.",Religions,times life nation becomes urgent reflect issuing statements purport carry absolute truths reality mask self serving judgments living one moments time dangerous less dramatic escalation israeli palestinian conflict healthy keep quiet spouting purportedly insightful statements nonetheless hateful confusing disastrously far reaching chosen express little media today nuanced intelligent debate severely overshadowed global confusion digital age imposed social media become havens ideological crooks capable causing devastating excesses enemies nuance verge achieving cultural rupture invokes extremes without form subtlety favors pursuit ideological agenda search truth lets get heart matter fog idea association find denouncing anti semitism france would mean renouncing fundamental rights peoples earth including legitimate rights palestinian people warn rise anti muslim rhetoric would logic assimilate islamism choose side choose extreme must explain justify fight physical mental strength save remains fragile humanity ability contradict without insulting one another without counting enemies nuance lie ambush assail unjust malicious accusations theres manipulative simplification approach ultimate aim maintaining climate conflict allows run rampant long possible according jokers french intellectual life denunciation anti semitism form taqiya act concealing ones true opinions order deceive enemy reduced racist image concealing muslim unfit french citizen hiding support suffering palestinian population real respect nothing teach universal human conscience images stronger words matter camp civilian victims camp peace voices raised around world remind urgency ending war need cohabitation two states palestine israel muslims france subjected des accusations essentialize make accomplices worst excesses accusations regularly made french citizens resolutely attached peace freedom speak favor end murderous bombardments gaza protection civilian populations without exception release hostages free access humanitarian aid lifting blockade gaza,time life nation becom urgent reflect issu statement purport carri absolut truth realiti mask self serv judgment live one moment time danger less dramat escal isra palestinian conflict healthi keep quiet spout purportedli insight statement nonetheless hate confus disastr far reach chosen express littl media today nuanc intellig debat sever overshadow global confus digit age impos social media becom haven ideolog crook capabl caus devast excess enemi nuanc verg achiev cultur ruptur invok extrem without form subtleti favor pursuit ideolog agenda search truth let get heart matter fog idea associ find denounc anti semit franc would mean renounc fundament right peopl earth includ legitim right palestinian peopl warn rise anti muslim rhetor would logic assimil islam choos side choos extrem must explain justifi fight physic mental strength save remain fragil human abil contradict without insult one anoth without count enemi nuanc lie ambush assail unjust malici accus there manipul simplif approach ultim aim maintain climat conflict allow run rampant long possibl accord joker french intellectu life denunci anti semit form taqiya act conceal one true opinion order deceiv enemi reduc racist imag conceal muslim unfit french citizen hide support suffer palestinian popul real respect noth teach univers human conscienc imag stronger word matter camp civilian victim camp peac voic rais around world remind urgenc end war need cohabit two state palestin israel muslim franc subject de accus essenti make accomplic worst excess accus regularli made french citizen resolut attach peac freedom speak favor end murder bombard gaza protect civilian popul without except releas hostag free access humanitarian aid lift blockad gaza
"Paris Olympics 2024: Security arrangements are taking 'all threats into account,' French government says","    With nine months to go before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, the French authorities are seeking to reassure the public in the face of the increased risk of terrorism, given the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ","The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its flood of tragic images have dominated the headlines since the surprise attack by Hamas on October 7. The ramifications are global. France is no exception and raised its terrorist alert to the highest level following the attack in Arras on Friday, October 13, which claimed the life of a teacher. Since then, the threats have multiplied, at the Louvre, the Château de Versailles and French airports. On Wednesday, October 18, at least 10 airports (Lille, Lyon-Bron, Nice, Toulouse, Beauvais, Nantes, Pau, Biarritz, Strasbourg...) had to be evacuated.In just over nine months, the country will be hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games. It's impossible to imagine that this global event will be immune to the risk of terrorism. How does the situation in the Middle East factor into discussions between government departments on security for the Paris Games? How can we ensure the smooth running of the opening ceremony on the Seine? These questions are likely to feature prominently on the agenda of the inter-ministerial committee meeting on Games security scheduled for Friday, October 20 at the prime minister's office.For the moment, the Games Organizing Committee (Cojop) and public authorities are seeking to reassure people. Paris 2024 President Tony Estanguet stated that there is no plan B for the river parade, scheduled for July 26, 2024. ""From the outset, the authorities and Paris 2024 have ensured that security is the number one priority for the success of the Games. (...) We're not going to change our plans based on what's happening right now, because we've been on top of our game in terms of security from the outset,"" Estanguet assured L'Equipe on Monday. On the government side, they point out that the security arrangements for the Games – ""a priority concern of the organizers and the French government"" – are constantly being adapted to the geopolitical context and the scale of the threats. ""Plan A takes all threats into account,"" said a source at the Elysée Palace, recalling that France experienced the 2015 wave of attacks at the height of its bid to host the Olympic Games.Nearly 35,000 police officers and gendarmes will be mobilized to provide security for the opening ceremony of the Games, which is expected to attract some 500,000 spectators and dozens of heads of state and government.

Interview with a vampire expert: 'Our fascination with vampires is linked to our fascination with death',"    French anthropologist Philippe Charlier explores our popular fascination with vampires, which he believes reveals a fundamental fear of otherness as well as probes questions related to what lies between life and death. ","A forensic physician and anthropologist, Philippe Charlier is best known to the general public for his analyses of great historical figures, from Richard the Lionheart to Hitler, as well as Napoleon. However, this astute connoisseur of voodoo culture is also interested in the iconic figures of our collective Western imagination, on the borderline between reality and fantasy. After writing Zombies: An Anthropological Investigation of the Living Dead (2015) and Autopsie des Fantômes. Une histoire du Surnaturel (""Autopsy of Ghosts. A History of the Supernatural,"" untranslated, 2021), this year he presented and edited a work dating back to 1751, Le Traité sur les Apparitions et les Vampires (""Treatise on Apparitions and Vampires"") by the Benedictine monk Dom Augustin Calmet (1672-1757).This book, which caused quite a stir when it was first published, compiles numerous documented cases of vampirism in Eastern Europe. It provides Charlier with an opportunity to question our fascination with these beings who exist on the border between life and death, which are as frightening as they are captivating.Philippe Charlier: Dom Calmet was a scholarly Benedictine monk who rose through the ranks quite gradually to become abbot of Senones, eastern France. At the time, the abbey was among the most prominent in the Lorraine region, with an extremely extensive library. Calmet was an avid reader, with interests spanning archaeology, history and metaphysics. He was curious about everything. He was a great Enlightenment thinker, and some philosophers, such as Voltaire (1694-1778), came to consult him. He was an authority, like Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton (1716-1800) or Jean Mabillon (1632-1707) and so many other enlightened ecclesiastics.But Calmet was also interested in the ""mysterious"" and believed that the vampire phenomenon should be taken seriously. So, when he got wind of a vampire epidemic in Eastern Europe, he set out to find out more about these ""undead,"" compiling information as he usually did. Calmet sent letters to his vast network of European and non-European correspondents to gather as much information as possible. He also read a lot, especially theology and the stories of saints, which he compared with the testimonies that were sent to him.In his treatise, Calmet frequently takes one step forward and then one step back: We don't know whether he believes in vampires or not. However, he contends that there are so many recorded cases that there must be some element of truth. He thus aligns himself with the adage, ""There's no smoke without fire.""",Religions,forensic physician anthropologist philippe charlier best known general public analyses great historical figures richard lionheart hitler well napoleon however astute connoisseur voodoo culture also interested iconic figures collective western imagination borderline reality fantasy writing zombies anthropological investigation living dead autopsie des fant mes une histoire surnaturel autopsy ghosts history supernatural untranslated year presented edited work dating back trait sur les apparitions les vampires treatise apparitions vampires benedictine monk dom augustin calmet book caused quite stir first published compiles numerous documented cases vampirism eastern europe provides charlier opportunity question fascination beings exist border life death frightening captivating philippe charlier dom calmet scholarly benedictine monk rose ranks quite gradually become abbot senones eastern france time abbey among prominent lorraine region extremely extensive library calmet avid reader interests spanning archaeology history metaphysics curious everything great enlightenment thinker philosophers voltaire came consult authority like louis jean marie daubenton jean mabillon many enlightened ecclesiastics calmet also interested mysterious believed vampire phenomenon taken seriously got wind vampire epidemic eastern europe set find undead compiling information usually calmet sent letters vast network european non european correspondents gather much information possible also read lot especially theology stories saints compared testimonies sent treatise calmet frequently takes one step forward one step back dont know whether believes vampires however contends many recorded cases must element truth thus aligns adage theres smoke without fire,forens physician anthropologist philipp charlier best known gener public analys great histor figur richard lionheart hitler well napoleon howev astut connoisseur voodoo cultur also interest icon figur collect western imagin borderlin realiti fantasi write zombi anthropolog investig live dead autopsi de fant me une histoir surnaturel autopsi ghost histori supernatur untransl year present edit work date back trait sur le apparit le vampir treatis apparit vampir benedictin monk dom augustin calmet book caus quit stir first publish compil numer document case vampir eastern europ provid charlier opportun question fascin be exist border life death frighten captiv philipp charlier dom calmet scholarli benedictin monk rose rank quit gradual becom abbot senon eastern franc time abbey among promin lorrain region extrem extens librari calmet avid reader interest span archaeolog histori metaphys curiou everyth great enlighten thinker philosoph voltair came consult author like loui jean mari daubenton jean mabillon mani enlighten ecclesiast calmet also interest mysteri believ vampir phenomenon taken serious got wind vampir epidem eastern europ set find undead compil inform usual calmet sent letter vast network european non european correspond gather much inform possibl also read lot especi theolog stori saint compar testimoni sent treatis calmet frequent take one step forward one step back dont know whether believ vampir howev contend mani record case must element truth thu align adag there smoke without fire
India suspends visa services in Canada as rift widens over killing of Canadian citizen,    The retaliatory move on Thursday was in response to Justin Trudeau’s claims of India’s involvement in the murder of a Sikh activist in Vancouver. ,"New Delhi said on Thursday, September 21, it is seeking the reduction of Canadian diplomatic staff in India and has stopped visa services, as a row over the killing of a Sikh separatist deepens.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has demanded India treat with ""utmost seriousness"" allegations that Indian agents played a role in the June murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar near Vancouver.The fallout prompted tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions and a forceful denial from India, which said any suggestion it played a role in Nijjar's killing was ""absurd."" The allegation has sent already strained relations between the world's most populous country and G7 member Canada to a new low.""We have informed the Canadian government that there should be parity"" in diplomatic presence, Indian foreign ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi told reporters. ""Their numbers here are very much higher than ours in Canada... I assume there will be a reduction.""New Delhi also said it had stopped handling visa applications in Canada, blaming ""security threats"" which they said were ""disrupting"" the work of their officials. ""For now, the security situation in Canada and because of Canadian government inaction, we have stopped visa services temporarily,"" Bagchi said.Hours earlier, Canada's High Commission said it would ""adjust"" diplomat numbers in India after ""threats on various social media"" against their staff. ""In light of the current environment where tensions have heightened, we are taking action to ensure the safety of our diplomats,"" Canada's mission said in a statement. ""As a result, and out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to temporarily adjust staff presence in India.""The mission did not give further details of the number of people leaving but said its offices were ""open and operational,"" while calling for the safety of its staff to be ensured. ""We expect India to provide for the security of our accredited diplomats and consular officers in India, just as we are for theirs,"" it said.On Monday, Ottawa expelled a diplomat it described as the head of India's foreign intelligence service in Canada, prompting New Delhi to order a Canadian diplomat to leave.The suspension of visas comes a day after India's foreign ministry said it was concerned for the safety of its citizens in Canada because of ""politically-condoned hate crimes and criminal violence."" ""Threats have particularly targeted Indian diplomats and sections of the Indian community who oppose the anti-India agenda,"" a ministry statement said Wednesday.Nijjar was shot dead by two masked assailants outside the Sikh temple he presided over in Surrey, a suburb of Vancouver. An activist for the creation of a Sikh state known as Khalistan, Nijjar was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder. He had denied those charges, according to the World Sikh Organization of Canada, a nonprofit organization that says it defends the interests of Canadian Sikhs.The Indian government accuses Ottawa of turning a blind eye to the activities of radical Sikh nationalists who advocate the creation of an independent state to be carved out of northern India. There were signs of a brewing crisis before Trudeau revealed the probe into Nijjar's death on Monday.India Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed ""strong concerns about continuing anti-India activities of extremist elements in Canada"" in his meeting with Trudeau at the G20 earlier this month. Canada had also suspended negotiations for a free-trade agreement with India, and last week its trade minister canceled a trip to the country planned for October.The affair could complicate US government overtures to India, which have seen both countries steadily upgrade their relations over recent years.

"Benzema, French minister clash over 'Muslim Brotherhood' claim",    Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin accused the French football star of links to the Muslim Brotherhood Islamist group. ,"The lawyer of Karim Benzema has hit back at France's interior minister after he accused the French football star who plays for Saudi team Al-Ittihad of links to the Muslim Brotherhood Islamist group.Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin made the accusations after the reigning Ballon d'Or winner and former Real Madrid forward posted a message on social media about the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas. ""All our prayers are for the inhabitants of Gaza who are once again victims of these unjust bombings which spare no women or children,"" Benzema wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Hamas on October 7 launched shock raids into Israel, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and seizing about 200 hostages. Israel has since then launched wave after wave of retaliatory air strikes, killing more than 3,000 Palestinians in Gaza.Darmanin, speaking on conservative TV channel CNews, alleged that Benzema ""has a notorious link with the Muslim Brotherhood"", a Sunni Muslim Islamist group with its origins in Egypt that is now banned by Cairo.""This is false! Karim Benzema has never had the slightest relation with this organization,"" Benzema's lawyer Hugues Vigier said in a statement. He said that Benzema was expressing ""natural compassion"" with ""what many today describe as war crimes being committed in Gaza, but which does not detract from the horror of the terrorist acts of October 7, something not open to discussion"". The lawyer added that he was planning to file a complaint against Darmanin for his comments.Benzema, 35, who was born in France to parents of Algerian origin, has been one of the standout French stars of the last decade. He joined the Saudi club on a hugely lucrative three-year deal this year after 14 seasons with Real Madrid where he lifted five Champions Leagues, four La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey.But after a stellar 2021-22 season when he led Real to Champions League glory and was rewarded with the Ballon d'Or for the world's best player, he was troubled by injuries that ruled him out of France's World Cup campaign in Qatar last year.Darmanin, 41, has carved out a reputation as a hardliner in the mould of his political mentor ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy and makes no secret of his own presidential ambitions.",Sports,lawyer karim benzema hit back frances interior minister accused french football star plays saudi team ittihad links muslim brotherhood islamist group interior minister rald darmanin made accusations reigning ballon dor winner former real madrid forward posted message social media conflict israel palestinian militant group hamas prayers inhabitants gaza victims unjust bombings spare women children benzema wrote formerly twitter hamas october launched shock raids israel killing people mostly civilians seizing hostages israel since launched wave wave retaliatory air strikes killing palestinians gaza darmanin speaking conservative channel cnews alleged benzema notorious link muslim brotherhood sunni muslim islamist group origins egypt banned cairo false karim benzema never slightest relation organization benzemas lawyer hugues vigier said statement said benzema expressing natural compassion many today describe war crimes committed gaza detract horror terrorist acts october something open discussion lawyer added planning file complaint darmanin comments benzema born france parents algerian origin one standout french stars last decade joined saudi club hugely lucrative three year deal year seasons real madrid lifted five champions leagues four liga titles three copas del rey stellar season led real champions league glory rewarded ballon dor worlds best player troubled injuries ruled frances world cup campaign qatar last year darmanin carved reputation hardliner mould political mentor president nicolas sarkozy makes secret presidential ambitions,lawyer karim benzema hit back franc interior minist accus french footbal star play saudi team ittihad link muslim brotherhood islamist group interior minist rald darmanin made accus reign ballon dor winner former real madrid forward post messag social media conflict israel palestinian milit group hama prayer inhabit gaza victim unjust bomb spare women children benzema wrote formerli twitter hama octob launch shock raid israel kill peopl mostli civilian seiz hostag israel sinc launch wave wave retaliatori air strike kill palestinian gaza darmanin speak conserv channel cnew alleg benzema notori link muslim brotherhood sunni muslim islamist group origin egypt ban cairo fals karim benzema never slightest relat organ benzema lawyer hugu vigier said statement said benzema express natur compass mani today describ war crime commit gaza detract horror terrorist act octob someth open discuss lawyer ad plan file complaint darmanin comment benzema born franc parent algerian origin one standout french star last decad join saudi club huge lucr three year deal year season real madrid lift five champion leagu four liga titl three copa del rey stellar season led real champion leagu glori reward ballon dor world best player troubl injuri rule franc world cup campaign qatar last year darmanin carv reput hardlin mould polit mentor presid nicola sarkozi make secret presidenti ambit
Macron's majority offers tax gift to international sports federations,"    On October 18, MPs from France's governing coalition presented an amendment to the 2024 budget bill. It exempts FIFA in particular, which has a bureau in Paris. ","An amendment to the budget bill for 2024, tabled discreetly on Wednesday, October 18, could be the subject of much discussion. A few months ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, the MPs of the presidential majority (Renaissance, MoDem and Horizons) have introduced an amendment that creates a particularly accommodating tax regime for the 30 or so international sports federations recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).This amendment, which was revealed by the financial newspaper Les Echos, aims to ""encourage the establishment of and retention within France"" of these bodies ""by guaranteeing them an appropriate and sustainable tax framework for their activities in governing sport and promoting the practice of sport, which are carried out outside the competitive or commercial field"" – meaning the bodies' for-profit and commercial activities. In concrete terms, the measure will result in exemptions from corporate income tax, local property tax and value-added tax on profits made in France.The new framework also exempts employees of those federations who are French tax residents from income tax until the fifth calendar year following the year during which they started working for them. This amendment ""is limited in time and, once again, concerns only non-commercial activities,"" insisted the sports ministry.According to a report in Les Echos, which Le Monde was able to confirm, this tax regime was part of the draft budget submitted to the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest administrative court, for consideration in mid-September. But the court issued a negative opinion on the grounds of a ""breach of tax equality."" A last-minute amendment was then presented by MPs from French President Emmanuel Macron's majority, incorporating the Conseil d'Etat's remarks, notably regarding the time limit.This amendment seems tailor-made for the International Automobile Federation, recognized by the IOC since 2012 and with offices in Paris, and the International Federation of American Football. But also – and above all – for the very wealthy International Association Football Federation, FIFA, which has had an office at the Hôtel de la Marine on Place de la Concorde in the heart of Paris since June 2021. The impressive building, built in the 18th century, was partly renovated with funds from Qatar, the host country of the 2022 World Cup.This branch – which was already not subject to corporate income tax – currently employs around 20 people. It was supposed to accommodate 70 people from the football governing body's headquarters in Zurich (Switzerland), notably those in charge of the FIFA Forward development program and also issues of governance and cooperation with African federations. Since November 2022, it has also housed the federation's Clearing House. This entity is responsible for guaranteeing the payment of training rewards to football training clubs, as part of the transfer market, and will not be affected by the new tax regime.",Sports,amendment budget bill tabled discreetly wednesday october could subject much discussion months ahead paris olym mps presidential majority renaissance modem horizons introduced amendment creates particularly accommodating tax regime international sports federations recognized international olym ioc amendment revealed financial newspaper les echos aims encourage establishment retention within france bodies guaranteeing appropriate sustainable tax framework activities governing sport promoting practice sport carried outside competitive commercial field meaning bodies profit commercial activities concrete terms measure result exemptions corporate income tax local property tax value added tax profits made france new framework also exempts employees federations french tax residents income tax fifth calendar year following year started working amendment limited time concerns non commercial activities insisted sports ministry according report les echos monde able confirm tax regime part draft budget submitted conseil detat frances highest administrative court consideration mid september court issued negative opinion grounds breach tax equality last minute amendment presented mps french president emmanuel macrons majority incorporating conseil detats remarks notably regarding time limit amendment seems tailor made international automobile federation recognized ioc since offices paris international federation american football also wealthy international association football federation fifa office tel marine place concorde heart paris since june impressive building built century partly renovated funds qatar host country world cup branch already subject corporate income tax currently employs around people supposed accommodate people football governing bodys headquarters zurich switzerland notably charge fifa forward development program also issues governance cooperation african federations since november also housed federations clearing house entity responsible guaranteeing payment training rewards football training clubs part transfer market affected new tax regime,amend budget bill tabl discreetli wednesday octob could subject much discuss month ahead pari olym mp presidenti major renaiss modem horizon introduc amend creat particularli accommod tax regim intern sport feder recogn intern olym ioc amend reveal financi newspap le echo aim encourag establish retent within franc bodi guarante appropri sustain tax framework activ govern sport promot practic sport carri outsid competit commerci field mean bodi profit commerci activ concret term measur result exempt corpor incom tax local properti tax valu ad tax profit made franc new framework also exempt employe feder french tax resid incom tax fifth calendar year follow year start work amend limit time concern non commerci activ insist sport ministri accord report le echo mond abl confirm tax regim part draft budget submit conseil detat franc highest administr court consider mid septemb court issu neg opinion ground breach tax equal last minut amend present mp french presid emmanuel macron major incorpor conseil detat remark notabl regard time limit amend seem tailor made intern automobil feder recogn ioc sinc offic pari intern feder american footbal also wealthi intern associ footbal feder fifa offic tel marin place concord heart pari sinc june impress build built centuri partli renov fund qatar host countri world cup branch alreadi subject corpor incom tax current employ around peopl suppos accommod peopl footbal govern bodi headquart zurich switzerland notabl charg fifa forward develop program also issu govern cooper african feder sinc novemb also hous feder clear hous entiti respons guarante payment train reward footbal train club part transfer market affect new tax regim
Rugby World Cup 2023: Argentina's unexpected semi-final against New Zealand,"    After a poor start to the World Cup, Argentina have gradually righted their ship and on Friday will be aiming to repeat their 2020 and 2022 exploits – the only two occasions when they have beaten the All Blacks. ","At the final whistle of Argentina's first match in the Rugby World Cup, against England on September 9, who could have imagined that these Pumas would reach the last four of the competition? Yet, at 8 pm on Friday, October 20, at the Stade de France in Paris, the South Americans will face New Zealand for a place in the final.The Argentinian team's inaugural performance at Marseille's Stade Vélodrome over a month ago reached the heights of mediocrity. Outnumbered for most of the match against a struggling England side, the Pumas proved unable to outwit their opponents' tactical trap of ferocious defense and intensive use of footwork. Add to this their incredible clumsiness (16 handling errors) and astonishing indiscipline (14 penalties), and you had the ingredients for one of the least exciting matches of the World Cup, which ended with a significant victory for England (27-10).Where were the Argentinians who had come within a single point of South Africa (22-21) and beaten Australia in the Rugby Championship (34-31) a few weeks earlier? Well, clearly not on the field at Marseille. ""There was almost no play. There were so many stoppages. The play we did get we didn’t master every well. That was by design by the other team. They did it very well. They put us in that corner,"" commented coach Michael Cheika harshly after the game. ""It was a first World Cup match for the team and for many of the players,"" explained his assistant, Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe.In the words of forwards coach Andrés Bordoy, the team ""took a long hard look at themselves"" after this setback. And they certainly learned from their setback. ""When you lose a match like that, you learn more than you think, especially at the start of the Rugby World Cup,"" said captain Julian Montoya. The Argentinians immediately found themselves with their backs up against the wall: A second rout in the group phase would be synonymous with elimination. On Friday evening, against the All Blacks, they will be playing more or less their fifth knockout match. As the hooker summed up: After the defeat to England, ""We've been playing a final a week.""And this high-stakes approach worked. By winning 13 days later against Samoa (19-10), the Pumas not only kept their World Cup hopes alive, but they also reassured themselves that they understood the fundamentals of the game. ""Against England, we didn't do what we were supposed to do. Today we did a lot better,"" said a delighted Montoya after the match. ""We got off the bus and out of the changing rooms today,"" laughed an only half-joking Cheika.",Sports,final whistle argentinas first match rugby world cup england september could imagined pumas would reach last four competition yet friday october stade france paris south americans face new zealand place final argentinian teams inaugural performance marseilles stade lodrome month ago reached heights mediocrity outnumbered match struggling england side pumas proved unable outwit opponents tactical trap ferocious defense intensive use footwork add incredible clumsiness handling errors astonishing indiscipline penalties ingredients one least exciting matches world cup ended significant victory england argentinians come within single point south africa beaten australia rugby championship weeks earlier well clearly field marseille almost play many stoppages play get master every well design team well put corner commented coach michael cheika harshly game first world cup match team many players explained assistant juan martin fernandez lobbe words forwards coach andr bordoy team took long hard look setback certainly learned setback lose match like learn think especially start rugby world cup said captain julian montoya argentinians immediately found backs wall second rout group phase would synonymous elimination friday evening blacks playing less fifth knockout match hooker summed defeat england weve playing final week high stakes approach worked winning days later samoa pumas kept world cup hopes alive also reassured understood fundamentals game england didnt supposed today lot better said delighted montoya match got bus changing rooms today laughed half joking cheika,final whistl argentina first match rugbi world cup england septemb could imagin puma would reach last four competit yet friday octob stade franc pari south american face new zealand place final argentinian team inaugur perform marseil stade lodrom month ago reach height mediocr outnumb match struggl england side puma prove unabl outwit oppon tactic trap feroci defens intens use footwork add incred clumsi handl error astonish indisciplin penalti ingredi one least excit match world cup end signific victori england argentinian come within singl point south africa beaten australia rugbi championship week earlier well clearli field marseil almost play mani stoppag play get master everi well design team well put corner comment coach michael cheika harshli game first world cup match team mani player explain assist juan martin fernandez lobb word forward coach andr bordoy team took long hard look setback certainli learn setback lose match like learn think especi start rugbi world cup said captain julian montoya argentinian immedi found back wall second rout group phase would synonym elimin friday even black play less fifth knockout match hooker sum defeat england weve play final week high stake approach work win day later samoa puma kept world cup hope aliv also reassur understood fundament game england didnt suppos today lot better said delight montoya match got bu chang room today laugh half joke cheika
"Francis, the grandson of a migrant and a pope",From the Archive,"How many were there? Two hundred and fifty? Three hundred? More? Their bodies lay floating on the dark waters, women, men and children who couldn't cling to a raft or buoy. The ocean had already swallowed their cries of terror as the lights of the rescue ships swept through the darkness, unable to see all the bodies. Breathless, the shipwreck victims had drowned, sometimes torn apart by sharks. Among them were 118 ""Syrians,"" according to the passenger registers – traders from Lebanon or Damascus – but also a great many Italians, who had left with their families, with papa and mama, but also their grandparents – nonno and nonna.This was not the fate of a dinghy in the Mediterranean but one off the coast of Brazil, on an Italian liner – the Principessa Mafalda – launched three years before the Titanic. The liner had set sail from Genoa on October 11, 1927, with 971 passengers on board, the holds full of Argentinian dreams. Since the end of the 19th century, millions of settlers have crossed the Atlantic like this, their entire lives piled into trunks, in search of a peaceful and prosperous land. At the time, Argentina was the world's sixth-largest power, a fast-growing, rich and dynamic country. In Buenos Aires, three out of every four inhabitants came from Europe. They were nicknamed the Porteños (""those from the port""), and rumor had it that the whole capital ""came off a boat.""The Principessa Mafalda had already docked in Barcelona, Rio, Santos and Montevideo. As the ship crossed the equator, the captain organized a party on the deck, complete with a live band. Third-class passengers mingled with the clientele in the lounges. The elegant ladies danced the tango on the two ballrooms's polished parquet floors, where tango master Carlos Gardel, who had boarded the ship a few months earlier, might have sung a milonga.But suddenly, something went wrong. On October 25, 1927, a few days before its arrival, the port-side propeller's shaft snapped around 6 pm. A leak started. The holds were flooded.

France stuns Women's Rugby World Champions New Zealand with surprise win,"    The French claimed an early lead and defended it bravely, making more than 200 tackles to snatch a first-ever win over the Black Ferns on New Zealand soil on Saturday. ","France used a watertight defense to stun world champions New Zealand 18-17 in a surprise result at the WXV1 top-tier women's rugby tournament in Wellington on Saturday, October 21.The French claimed an early lead and defended it bravely, making more than 200 tackles to snatch a first-ever win over the Black Ferns on New Zealand soil and hand the tournament hosts their first defeat against any side for two years.The result also exacts some revenge for France's heartbreaking Rugby World Cup exit last year, when beaten by New Zealand by a single point in the semi-finals.Captain Manae Feleu said her third-ranked French side had tackled their way to victory. ""We knew it was going to be a great battle against the Black Ferns, they are world champions,"" she said.""We knew it was going to be hard and tough for 80 minutes and I'm just grateful we gave it 100 percent.""Operating with less possession, France opened up a 15-7 lead at halftime through long-range tries to wingers Emilie Boulard and Cyrielle Banet.Liana Mikaele-Tu'u scored New Zealand's opening try but her team slipped further behind when Morgane Bourgeois landed penalties on either side of the interval.New Zealand's chances diminished when replacement prop Chryss Viliko was shown a red card for an illegal cleanout with 15 minutes remaining but her team regrouped and created a try for winger Katelyn Vaha'akolo to close within one point.Black Ferns captain Ruahei Demant said her team would need to improve for their remaining matches against Wales and England.""We were down in their half a lot, but we didn't capitalize on the pressure we were putting them under,"" Demant said. ""We know what the French bring. You can't mistakes because they punish you.""This completed the first of three rounds of matches at the inaugural tournament, which features the six leading women's teams.Canada beat Wales 42-22 earlier on Saturday, after top-ranked England opened with a 42-7 rout of Australia on Friday.Goal-kicking forward Sophie de Goede scored 17 points for Canada, converting all six of their tries, including her own.The fourth-ranked Canadians pulled clear in the second half after leading by four points at the interval.The second round of matches is in Dunedin next week, with England facing Canada in the clash of two unbeaten sides, while New Zealand play Wales and France meet Australia.The tournament concludes in Auckland, where the highlight is expected to be a rematch of last year's World Cup final, between New Zealand and England.",Sports,france used watertight defense stun world champions new zealand surprise result wxv top tier womens rugby tournament wellington saturday october french claimed early lead defended bravely making tackles snatch first ever win black ferns new zealand soil hand tournament hosts first defeat side two years result also exacts revenge frances heartbreaking rugby world cup exit last year beaten new zealand single point semi finals captain manae feleu said third ranked french side tackled way victory knew going great battle black ferns world champions said knew going hard tough minutes grateful gave percent operating less possession france opened lead halftime long range tries wingers emilie boulard cyrielle banet liana mikaele tuu scored new zealands opening try team slipped behind morgane bourgeois landed penalties either side interval new zealands chances diminished replacement prop chryss viliko shown red card illegal cleanout minutes remaining team regrouped created try winger katelyn vahaakolo close within one point black ferns captain ruahei demant said team would need improve remaining matches wales england half lot didnt capitalize pressure putting demant said know french bring cant mistakes punish completed first three rounds matches inaugural tournament features six leading womens teams canada beat wales earlier saturday top ranked england opened rout australia friday goal kicking forward sophie goede scored points canada converting six tries including fourth ranked canadians pulled clear second half leading four points interval second round matches dunedin next week england facing canada clash two unbeaten sides new zealand play wales france meet australia tournament concludes auckland highlight expected rematch last years world cup final new zealand england,franc use watertight defens stun world champion new zealand surpris result wxv top tier women rugbi tournament wellington saturday octob french claim earli lead defend brave make tackl snatch first ever win black fern new zealand soil hand tournament host first defeat side two year result also exact reveng franc heartbreak rugbi world cup exit last year beaten new zealand singl point semi final captain mana feleu said third rank french side tackl way victori knew go great battl black fern world champion said knew go hard tough minut grate gave percent oper less possess franc open lead halftim long rang tri winger emili boulard cyriel banet liana mikael tuu score new zealand open tri team slip behind morgan bourgeoi land penalti either side interv new zealand chanc diminish replac prop chryss viliko shown red card illeg cleanout minut remain team regroup creat tri winger katelyn vahaakolo close within one point black fern captain ruahei demant said team would need improv remain match wale england half lot didnt capit pressur put demant said know french bring cant mistak punish complet first three round match inaugur tournament featur six lead women team canada beat wale earlier saturday top rank england open rout australia friday goal kick forward sophi goed score point canada convert six tri includ fourth rank canadian pull clear second half lead four point interv second round match dunedin next week england face canada clash two unbeaten side new zealand play wale franc meet australia tournament conclud auckland highlight expect rematch last year world cup final new zealand england
Rugby World Cup: New Zealand dominates Argentina to secure spot in final,"    New Zealand bulldozed through Argentina 44-6 on Friday to reach the Rugby World Cup final for a record fifth time. The All Blacks will bid for a record fourth title against defending champion South Africa or England, who play their semifinal on Saturday. ","Will Jordan scored a hat-trick of tries as New Zealand outclassed Argentina 44-6 on Friday, October 20, to set up a Rugby World Cup final against the winner of the second semi-final between England and defending champions South Africa. The result at a rainy Stade de France saw the All Blacks become the first team to reach the final of a World Cup on five occasions.""It's so sweet. It's new territory for this group,"" said player of the match Jordie Barrett. ""I am just so proud of this group. It's not done yet. We will have a very tough match regardless of who we have next week."" The three-time champions, who beat Ireland in a thrilling quarter-final last week, outscored Los Pumas by seven tries to none, mixing some doughty early defense with front-foot flamboyance in attack.History was on New Zealand's side coming into the match, the All Blacks having won 33 of the 36 previous encounters between the two sides with Los Pumas claiming two victories, with one match drawn. And although it was Emiliano Boffelli who opened the scoring for Argentina with a fifth-minute penalty, it was not long before New Zealand's dominance shone through.The All Blacks spurned their first chance of a kick at goal, instead going to the corner for an attacking line-out and after a series of pick-and-drives, a long Richie Mo'unga cut-out pass found Jordan and the winger crossed for an easy try that the fly-half converted. As forwards linked impeccably with backs, Jordan then turned provider, drawing in the final defender just enough to allow Jordie Barrett a line into the corner for New Zealand's second try.Although they pinched a couple of All Black line-outs, Los Pumas looked increasingly ragged around the breakdown and consistently lost territory through their ill-discipline at the ruck. Boffelli grabbed his second penalty after a rare show of Argentinian pressure, but Juan Martin Gonzalez handed the advantage straight back after taking out Jordan under a high ball and Mo'unga slotted the penalty.Mark Tele'a showed why All Blacks coach Ian Foster had recalled him in place of Leicester Fainga'anuku after serving a one-match suspension for a breach of team protocol, the winger jinking his way through four defenders towards the line. The ball was worked left by Aaron Smith to find Frizzell unmarked on the wing, the outstanding flanker crossing for the All Blacks' third try. Mo'unga's conversion came back off the post, but at 20-6 at half-time, it felt as if the game was all but over as a contest. That was confirmed just two minutes into the second period as Smith sniped over for a classic scrum-half's opportunistic try, Mo'unga kicking the extras.A streaking break by the fly-half then set up the All Blacks deep in Argentine territory and with Tele'a proving a handful, Frizzell showed incredible strength to muscle his way over for his second try. A raft of replacements disrupted the rhythm of the game, but Tele'a was on hand to draw in three defenders as New Zealand ran through the phases, leaving Finlay Christie to feed Jordan for his second five-pointer.Scott Barrett saw yellow for needlessly playing the ball in a ruck, but Jordan was on hand to finish off his own chip-and-chase for a third try and his eighth at a single World Cup to draw level with Jonah Lomu, Julian Savea and Bryan Habana. Argentina hung in there, however, and at least avoided the ignominy of suffering the highest margin of defeat in a World Cup semi-final, the All Blacks having beaten Wales 49-6 in 1987.",Sports,jordan scored hat trick tries new zealand outclassed argentina friday october set rugby world cup final winner second semi final england defending champions south africa result rainy stade france saw blacks become first team reach final world cup five occasions sweet new territory group said player match jordie barrett proud group done yet tough match regardless next week three time champions beat ireland thrilling quarter final last week outscored los pumas seven tries none mixing doughty early defense front foot flamboyance attack history new zealands side coming match blacks previous encounters two sides los pumas claiming two victories one match drawn although emiliano boffelli opened scoring argentina fifth minute penalty long new zealands dominance shone blacks spurned first chance kick goal instead going corner attacking line series long richie mounga cut pass found jordan winger crossed easy try fly half converted forwards linked impeccably backs jordan turned provider drawing final defender enough allow jordie barrett line corner new zealands second try although pinched couple black line outs los pumas looked increasingly ragged around breakdown consistently lost territory ill discipline ruck boffelli grabbed second penalty rare show argentinian pressure juan martin gonzalez handed advantage straight back taking jordan high ball mounga slotted penalty mark telea showed blacks coach ian foster recalled place leicester faingaanuku serving one match suspension breach team protocol winger jinking way four defenders towards line ball worked left aaron smith find frizzell unmarked wing outstanding flanker crossing blacks third try moungas conversion came back post half time felt game contest confirmed two minutes second period smith sniped classic scrum halfs opportunistic try mounga kicking extras streaking break fly half set blacks deep argentine territory telea proving handful frizzell showed incredible strength muscle way second try raft replacements disrupted rhythm game telea hand draw three defenders new zealand ran phases leaving finlay christie feed jordan second five pointer scott barrett saw yellow needlessly playing ball ruck jordan hand finish chip chase third try eighth single world cup draw level jonah lomu julian savea bryan habana argentina hung however least avoided ignominy suffering highest margin defeat world cup semi final blacks beaten wales,jordan score hat trick tri new zealand outclass argentina friday octob set rugbi world cup final winner second semi final england defend champion south africa result raini stade franc saw black becom first team reach final world cup five occas sweet new territori group said player match jordi barrett proud group done yet tough match regardless next week three time champion beat ireland thrill quarter final last week outscor lo puma seven tri none mix doughti earli defens front foot flamboy attack histori new zealand side come match black previou encount two side lo puma claim two victori one match drawn although emiliano boffelli open score argentina fifth minut penalti long new zealand domin shone black spurn first chanc kick goal instead go corner attack line seri long richi mounga cut pass found jordan winger cross easi tri fli half convert forward link impecc back jordan turn provid draw final defend enough allow jordi barrett line corner new zealand second tri although pinch coupl black line out lo puma look increasingli rag around breakdown consist lost territori ill disciplin ruck boffelli grab second penalti rare show argentinian pressur juan martin gonzalez hand advantag straight back take jordan high ball mounga slot penalti mark telea show black coach ian foster recal place leicest faingaanuku serv one match suspens breach team protocol winger jink way four defend toward line ball work left aaron smith find frizzel unmark wing outstand flanker cross black third tri mounga convers came back post half time felt game contest confirm two minut second period smith snipe classic scrum half opportunist tri mounga kick extra streak break fli half set black deep argentin territori telea prove hand frizzel show incred strength muscl way second tri raft replac disrupt rhythm game telea hand draw three defend new zealand ran phase leav finlay christi feed jordan second five pointer scott barrett saw yellow needlessli play ball ruck jordan hand finish chip chase third tri eighth singl world cup draw level jonah lomu julian savea bryan habana argentina hung howev least avoid ignomini suffer highest margin defeat world cup semi final black beaten wale
Rugby World Cup: New Zealand sweep Argentina aside with ease to reach their fifth-ever final,"    New Zealand's 44-6 semi-final victory over Argentina was enough to book their place in the World Cup Final. On Saturday, October 28, they will face either England or South Africa. ","When you think of New Zealand, two main clichés come to mind: flocks of sheep in a picture-postcard landscape, and a dominant black-clad rugby team. While goats are becoming increasingly rare on the island of the long white cloud − there are now just five per capita, a figure at its lowest since the mid-19th century − its rugby team, on the other hand, continues to occupy the heights of rugby.The proof: on Saturday, October 28, at the Stade de France, the All Blacks will be playing in the World Cup final for the fifth time in its history. On Friday, they effortlessly overcame the final hurdle, beating Argentina 44-6 in the semi-final.The day before, Argentina's assistant coach Felipe Contepomi stated an implacable truth of rugby: whoever your opponent is, the match always starts with a score of zero to zero. A way of saying that the Pumas had a chance against the New Zealand favorites and, at the very least, that they would start their match on the same footing. The problem with the All Blacks, especially since the start of the competition, is that this assumption doesn't hold up for very long. Unfortunately for the Argentinians, their experience at the Stade de France was a bitter one. They were overwhelmed by the players from the Pacific, unable to mount a competitive challenge.They opened the scoring after a fine sequence of play in the early stages but only led for six minutes. The New Zealanders then went on to score seven tries, keeping the South Americans at bay. Every time the men in black got close to the Argentine goal line, they hit the target. ""Against a team like New Zealand, the slightest mistake is fatal. They are so efficient. They converted all our mistakes into points"" lamented Argentina's Australian coach Michael Cheika after the match.Among the men in black's attacking arrows, winger Will Jordan is undoubtedly the sharpest: by scoring three tries, he took his total in the competition to eight, overtaking France's Damian Penaud (six tries). If the New Zealander returns behind the opposition line in the final, he will be the sole holder of the record for the number of tries scored in a World Cup, overtaking South Africa's Bryan Habana and his compatriots Julian Savea and Jonah Lomu.A series of tries sealed the fate of the match just after half-time. Although the Pumas, trailing 20-6 at the break, could still have hoped for a miraculous comeback in the second half, a solo try from scrum-half Aaron Smith in the 42nd minute gave his team an unassailable lead and killed off any remaining suspense.",Sports,think new zealand two main clich come mind flocks sheep landscape dominant black clad rugby team goats becoming increasingly rare island long white cloud five per capita figure lowest since mid century rugby team hand continues occupy heights rugby proof saturday october stade france blacks playing world cup final fifth time history friday effortlessly overcame final hurdle beating argentina semi final day argentinas assistant coach felipe contepomi stated implacable truth rugby whoever opponent match always starts score zero zero way saying pumas chance new zealand favorites least would start match footing problem blacks especially since start competition assumption doesnt hold long unfortunately argentinians experience stade france bitter one overwhelmed players pacific unable mount competitive challenge opened scoring fine sequence play early stages led six minutes new zealanders went score seven tries keeping south americans bay every time men black got close argentine goal line hit target team like new zealand slightest mistake fatal efficient converted mistakes points lamented argentinas australian coach michael cheika match among men blacks attacking arrows winger jordan undoubtedly sharpest scoring three tries took total competition eight overtaking frances damian penaud six tries new zealander returns behind opposition line final sole holder record number tries scored world cup overtaking south africas bryan habana compatriots julian savea jonah lomu series tries sealed fate match half time although pumas trailing break could still hoped miraculous comeback second half solo try scrum half aaron smith minute gave team unassailable lead killed remaining suspense,think new zealand two main clich come mind flock sheep landscap domin black clad rugbi team goat becom increasingli rare island long white cloud five per capita figur lowest sinc mid centuri rugbi team hand continu occupi height rugbi proof saturday octob stade franc black play world cup final fifth time histori friday effortlessli overcam final hurdl beat argentina semi final day argentina assist coach felip contepomi state implac truth rugbi whoever oppon match alway start score zero zero way say puma chanc new zealand favorit least would start match foot problem black especi sinc start competit assumpt doesnt hold long unfortun argentinian experi stade franc bitter one overwhelm player pacif unabl mount competit challeng open score fine sequenc play earli stage led six minut new zealand went score seven tri keep south american bay everi time men black got close argentin goal line hit target team like new zealand slightest mistak fatal effici convert mistak point lament argentina australian coach michael cheika match among men black attack arrow winger jordan undoubtedli sharpest score three tri took total competit eight overtak franc damian penaud six tri new zealand return behind opposit line final sole holder record number tri score world cup overtak south africa bryan habana compatriot julian savea jonah lomu seri tri seal fate match half time although puma trail break could still hope miracul comeback second half solo tri scrum half aaron smith minut gave team unassail lead kill remain suspens
"Rugby World Cup 2023: The Springboks, South Africa's 'light at the end of the tunnel'","    The South African team faces England in the World Cup semi-finals on Saturday. In a country plagued by unemployment, poverty and crime, their matches − and their successes − are a source of hope and unity. ","It's this woman in her fifties whom we met in a sports bar, who sees the South African rugby team as ""the hope of the country, when nothing else works."" This editorialist, who apologized to Les Bleus in a post on X (formerly Twitter): ""South Africa needed this more than you did. For us, it's beyond rugby,"" after the World Cup quarter-final victory. Or this Boks coach, for whom the matches are ""an opportunity to think about something else."" In South Africa, rugby lifts people's spirits.Even as the competition goes on, the clouds are gathering over the rainbow nation and its 62 million inhabitants. Crime and corruption, unemployment and poverty are compounded by inflation, an electricity crisis, potholes on the road, egg shortages due to avian flu, and the return of cholera to Pretoria's troubled waters. The picture is bleak, and locals are feeling blue. Amidst all of this, their safe haven is the green and gold colors − hope and fortune − of the Springboks.National team jerseys have been snapped up. Those for the 2023 World Cup are nowhere to be found, having sold out in authorized stores. Nike, the supplier, is accused of not having produced enough and of having limited the number of retailers. Fans are so frustrated that one of them sent a long letter to the American multinational to remind it of what the national team represents. ""South Africa is a land of many problems. (...) We have mass corruption, poverty, a health, food, water and energy crisis. There are few lights at the end of the tunnel in South Africa. One of them is our beloved Springboks,"" wrote 33-year-old Thomas Connolly. But despite his lyricism, store shelves are still empty as the semi-final between South Africa and England approaches at 9 pm on Saturday, October 21.Old jerseys or unauthorized replicas, South Africans are invited to wear the national team's colors every Friday for ""Bok Friday."" ""It's good for South Africa, it brings us together,"" enthused Gerrit Kruger, whose children swapped their school uniforms for the nation's uniform on this occasion. ""It's every day of the week that you'll see people dressed in Springbok accessories during the World Cup, we're very patriotic,"" added Non Welsford, manager of the Pirates Club bar in Johannesburg. ""Stronger together"" is the Springbok's slogan.The country has rallied behind captain Siya Kolisi. It's his face that is in the front row as he takes to the pitch on match nights. He has led the way for his teammates and has drawn an entire country into the fray. ""There's a lot to be said for his management skills, his flair and his ability to bring people together,"" says supporter Charl van Rooyen. Kolisi also reflects the image of a diverse South Africa, with its different communities reconciled.

Rugby World Cup: South Africa edges out England to secure spot in the final,    South Africa's thrilling 16-15 victory over England at the Stade de France on Saturday has set the stage for a Rugby World Cup final showdown against New Zealand next weekend. ,"South Africa pulled off a great escape to beat England 16-15 at the death on Saturday, October 21, and keep its title defense at the Rugby World Cup alive, setting up a blockbuster final against old rival New Zealand. One of them will win a record fourth Rugby World Cup.The Springboks trailed for the entire semifinal against England until replacement flyhalf Handre Pollard kicked a 78th-minute penalty from near halfway to edge them thrillingly ahead. From there, the Boks held on and closed out a second come-from-behind nailbiter after the one-point win over host France in the quarterfinals.England executed its gameplan to perfection to be in control, sending kick after kick from the base of the ruck or from Owen Farrell at flyhalf down onto the Springboks, who struggled with the high bombs all day in the rain in Paris. Farrell kicked four penalties and a long-range drop goal to put England 15-6 ahead with less than half an hour to play.South Africa's comeback started with a try to replacement lock RG Snyman in the 69th minute. The conversion put them two points behind at 15-13. The Springboks' set-piece misfired for most of the game but they won a scrum near halfway in the closing minutes and replacement props Ox Nche and Vincent Koch set themselves for a huge heave. The scrum went sideways and the Boks won the penalty they were looking for, leaving Pollard to send the highest of pressure goalkicks through the middle.Springboks coach Jacques Nienaber, who will leave after the World Cup and might have thought his time was up in the semis, put his head down on a desk in the coach's box and covered it with his hands at the end as the Springboks erupted in celebration.",Sports,south africa pulled great escape beat england death saturday october keep title defense rugby world cup alive setting blockbuster final old rival new zealand one win record fourth rugby world cup springboks trailed entire semifinal england replacement flyhalf handre pollard kicked minute penalty near halfway edge thrillingly ahead boks held closed second come behind nailbiter one point win host france quarterfinals england executed gameplan perfection control sending kick kick base ruck owen farrell flyhalf onto springboks struggled high bombs day rain paris farrell kicked four penalties long range drop goal put england ahead less half hour play south africas comeback started try replacement lock snyman minute conversion put two points behind springboks set piece misfired game scrum near halfway closing minutes replacement props nche vincent koch set huge heave scrum went sideways boks penalty looking leaving pollard send highest pressure goalkicks middle springboks coach jacques nienaber leave world cup might thought time semis put head desk coachs box covered hands end springboks erupted celebration,south africa pull great escap beat england death saturday octob keep titl defens rugbi world cup aliv set blockbust final old rival new zealand one win record fourth rugbi world cup springbok trail entir semifin england replac flyhalf handr pollard kick minut penalti near halfway edg thrillingli ahead bok held close second come behind nailbit one point win host franc quarterfin england execut gameplan perfect control send kick kick base ruck owen farrel flyhalf onto springbok struggl high bomb day rain pari farrel kick four penalti long rang drop goal put england ahead less half hour play south africa comeback start tri replac lock snyman minut convers put two point behind springbok set piec misfir game scrum near halfway close minut replac prop nche vincent koch set huge heav scrum went sideway bok penalti look leav pollard send highest pressur goalkick middl springbok coach jacqu nienab leav world cup might thought time semi put head desk coach box cover hand end springbok erupt celebr
Ligue 1: PSG defeats Strasbourg while Nice beats Marseille,"    Kylian Mbappe initiated the scoring for PSG in a comfortable 3-0 victory against Patrick Vieira's Strasbourg. Nice secured a narrow 1-0 win against ten-man Marseille, maintaining their unbeaten record and their position at the top of Ligue 1. ","Kylian Mbappe scored one goal and made another as Paris Saint-Germain beat Patrick Vieira's Strasbourg 3-0 in Ligue 1 on Saturday, October 21, but it is unbeaten Nice who are top of the table after a 1-0 victory over Marseille.Mbappe opened the scoring for PSG with a 10th-minute penalty and set up Carlos Soler to make it 2-0 just after the half-hour mark on a wet and windy day in Paris. The reigning champions added a third in the 77th minute courtesy of Fabian Ruiz to wrap up a routine victory. It was a second straight win for PSG following their 4-1 defeat away to Newcastle United in the Champions League earlier this month, and they sit a point behind Nice in second place.""The logical concern with these games straight after an international break is that it is clearly not easy for the players to switch their mentality but the team played well and managed the game very well,"" said PSG coach Luis Enrique. He rested several regular starters with this game also coming just before a key Champions League meeting with AC Milan.Achraf Hakimi and Ousmane Dembele were among those to be left out at kick-off, while Soler and Ruiz came in, as did Lee Kang-in. South Korean international Lee was making his first appearance for PSG in over a month, having helped his country win football gold at the Asian Games in the meantime. ""In general all those players who have been involved less up to now this season did well. They got an opportunity today and made the most of it,"" said Luis Enrique.However, there was no question of Mbappe being rested, and he opened the scoring from the penalty spot in front of an empty end of PSG's stadium, closed by the French league for this encounter as a punishment after homophobic chanting during a win over Marseille last month. The penalty was awarded for a foul on Goncalo Ramos, and Mbappe converted for his ninth club goal this season.South African striker Lebo Mothiba then thought he had equalized for Strasbourg, only for his goal to be disallowed for offside following a VAR check. Instead, PSG doubled their lead on 31 minutes as Mbappe produced a step-over to beat his marker before cutting the ball back from the byline for Soler to prod in.Soler set up the third goal late on for his fellow Spaniard Ruiz, not long after PSG suffered a scare when Mbappe went down needing treatment after Gerzino Nyamsi appeared to tread on his left foot. However, the France captain managed to carry on.Having sent out a team loaded with attacking players, just as he did in the defeat by Newcastle, Luis Enrique must decide whether to play the same way against Milan. ""Each match is different,"" he insisted, ""but my objective is to have 11 players attacking and 11 defending.""It was a third straight loss for Strasbourg, with the club who were recently bought by Chelsea's owners BlueCo, struggling for goals and having won just once in six games now. ""My young players need to learn and learn very quickly,"" said Vieira, whose line-up featured five outfield players aged 22 or under. ""We competed but we made too many mistakes to stand a chance.""Later, the Mediterranean derby was decided when Marseille defender Leonardo Balerdi was sent off for a second yellow card and substitute Evann Guessand headed in the resulting free-kick in the 79th minute. The result maintained Nice's unbeaten record this season under 34-year-old Italian coach Francesco Farioli and left them top, although Cote d'Azur rivals Monaco will replace them at the summit by beating Metz on Sunday.Nice have enjoyed a fine start to the season despite British owner Jim Ratcliffe being focused on acquiring a stake in Manchester United. ""We need to look at the league table as little as possible, but it has been a very positive start to the season,"" said Farioli. Marseille have won only once in four games under new coach Gennaro Gattuso and are seven points behind the leaders.",Sports,kylian mbappe scored one goal made another paris saint germain beat patrick

"Rugby World Cup 2023: Against South Africa, England gambles on 'winning ugly'","    The last remaining representative of the Northern Hemisphere in the World Cup, England faces the defending champions South Africa on Saturday for a place in the final, despite their crude play and their status as 'public enemy number 1' in France. ","Since the start of the Rugby World Cup, the English team has been accompanied across France by its usual − and noisy − cohort of supporters, but many of them have found fault with the game played by the Red Rose. Boring, in pain, badly outplayed in many areas at every encounter... the British team has failed to convince. And the public didn't let them forget it, booing whenever captain Owen Farrell appeared on the giant screens in World Cup stadiums. But England is still in the running. On Saturday, October 21, at 9 pm, at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis (Paris suburbs), the team will face defending champions South Africa for a place in the final.Before facing (and beating) Fiji − a team that thrilled French spectators − third row Billy Vunipola admitted he was probably part of the ""least favorite team"" in the competition. Is this the downside of representing the birthplace of rugby? Many countries have cultivated an antagonism towards England since rugby first appeared on their soil. Such is the case for Scotland, the English's opponent in the first-ever international match in 1871, and the French, of course, as well as other big names in world rugby. ""Everyone hates England,"" said Ireland winger Mack Hansen in early March, during the Six Nations Championship.Rather than formalizing this label, the team has turned it into a second skin. ""In terms of being public enemy number one, we are happy to take that mantle,"" said Vunipola. Ahead of Saturday's semi-final, a rematch of the 2019 World Cup final, prop Ellis Genge argued that ""the noise and having our backs up against the wall, with everyone wanting us to lose,"" fueled his game. And when it comes to facing the rugged Springboks, who defeated Les Bleus in the previous round, the English will need all their energy. They have come a long way.""The growth in the team is that we’ve learned how to find a way to win ugly,"" third row Ben Earl noted after England's painful 18-17 victory over Samoa on October 7. ""The performance highlighted some holes in our game, but we knew they were there and we found a way to win ugly. Sometimes winning ugly is the most rewarding."" Especially after several years of consecutive defeats.So what then if he has to endure a daily barrage of criticism − starting from his own fans − about England's disappointing game. ""This English team is ugly – no desire, no joy, no consistency,"" wrote former French flanker Olivier Magne on X (formerly Twitter), calling it a ""repulsive rugby."" ""I don't care what people think of us,"" retorted coach Steve Borthwick, after his side's qualification for the last four.",Sports,since start rugby world cup english team accompanied across france usual noisy cohort supporters many found fault game played red rose boring pain badly outplayed many areas every encounter british team failed convince public didnt let forget booing whenever captain owen farrell appeared giant screens world cup stadiums england still running saturday october stade france saint denis paris suburbs team face defending champions south africa place final facing beating fiji team thrilled french spectators third row billy vunipola admitted probably part least favorite team competition downside representing birthplace rugby many countries cultivated antagonism towards england since rugby first appeared soil case scotland englishs opponent first ever international match french course well big names world rugby everyone hates england said ireland winger mack hansen early march six nations championship rather formalizing label team turned second skin terms public enemy number one happy take mantle said vunipola ahead saturdays semi final rematch world cup final prop ellis genge argued noise backs wall everyone wanting lose fueled game comes facing rugged springboks defeated les bleus previous round english need energy come long way growth team learned find way win ugly third row ben earl noted englands painful victory samoa october performance highlighted holes game knew found way win ugly sometimes winning ugly rewarding especially several years consecutive defeats endure daily barrage criticism starting fans englands disappointing game english team ugly desire joy consistency wrote former french flanker olivier magne formerly twitter calling repulsive rugby dont care people think retorted coach steve borthwick sides qualification last four,sinc start rugbi world cup english team accompani across franc usual noisi cohort support mani found fault game play red rose bore pain badli outplay mani area everi encount british team fail convinc public didnt let forget boo whenev captain owen farrel appear giant screen world cup stadium england still run saturday octob stade franc saint deni pari suburb team face defend champion south africa place final face beat fiji team thrill french spectat third row billi vunipola admit probabl part least favorit team competit downsid repres birthplac rugbi mani countri cultiv antagon toward england sinc rugbi first appear soil case scotland english oppon first ever intern match french cours well big name world rugbi everyon hate england said ireland winger mack hansen earli march six nation championship rather formal label team turn second skin term public enemi number one happi take mantl said vunipola ahead saturday semi final rematch world cup final prop elli geng argu nois back wall everyon want lose fuel game come face rug springbok defeat le bleu previou round english need energi come long way growth team learn find way win ugli third row ben earl note england pain victori samoa octob perform highlight hole game knew found way win ugli sometim win ugli reward especi sever year consecut defeat endur daili barrag critic start fan england disappoint game english team ugli desir joy consist wrote former french flanker olivi magn formerli twitter call repuls rugbi dont care peopl think retort coach steve borthwick side qualif last four
Tax gift for FIFA: France's miscalculation,"An amendment to the 2024 draft budget aims to exempt international sports federations from taxes. With France having little budgetary room for maneuver, the move looks like a political blunder.","Since his election in 2017, President Emmanuel Macron has made France's attractiveness one of the pillars of his economic policy. The strategy is built around a series of tax and regulatory reforms aiming to encourage investments and employment on French territory.This laudable commitment is about to take on a new dimension with the ambition of attracting international sports federations recognized by the International Olympic Committee. MPs from Macron's Renaissance party have discreetly tabled an amendment to that effect for the 2024 budget bill, which is currently up for discussion and approval in Parliament. They are proposing to roll out the red carpet for up to around 30 federations, exempting them from corporate tax, property tax and corporate value-added tax. In addition, employees of the federations based in France would be exempt from income tax for at least five years.The main aim of the provision is to curry favor with the wealthy global football governing body, FIFA, whose headquarters are currently in Zurich, Switzerland. In 2021, it opened a branch in Paris, which it hopes to expand by employing around 100 people, compared with around 20 currently. But in the absence of a more favorable tax environment, the branch may leave France.The proposed tax break is problematic in several respects. On the legal front, the Council of State warned in September that the amendment could introduce a ""breach of tax equality."" The legislators sought to circumvent this obstacle by limiting the tax benefits over time. Nonetheless, the Constitutional Council could also rule on the legality of the measure.The timeliness of the amendment is also questionable from a purely fiscal point of view. FIFA's current employees pay taxes in Switzerland, while the organization benefits from a tax rate of 12%. It is incongruous for France to enter into a race to the bottom with such a country, to the benefit of employees who are for the most part very well paid and of an organization that churns out billions. With France having little budgetary room for maneuver, the move looks like a political blunder.Finally, if the idea is to raise France's profile by giving FIFA a greater presence in Paris, it is not entirely convincing, given the federation's tarnished reputation. Its president, Gianni Infantino, is under two separate criminal investigations in Switzerland. In Paris, public financial investigators are looking into possible corruption during the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. They have already issued indictments and an international arrest warrant for a former FIFA executive.With its unbridled race for expansion to boost revenues, suspicions of cronyism and opaque governance in awarding competitions, and its problematic laxity in defending sporting values and human rights, FIFA is in no way a guest likely to enhance France's prestige. All things considered, it's fair to say that the Renaissance parliamentarians' amendment is not worth the risk.",Sports,since election president emmanuel macron made frances attractiveness one pillars economic policy strategy built around series tax regulatory reforms aiming encourage investments employment french territory laudable commitment take new dimension ambition attracting international sports federations recognized international olym mps macrons renaissance party discreetly tabled amendment effect budget bill currently discussion approval parliament proposing roll red carpet around federations exempting corporate tax property tax corporate value added tax addition employees federations based france would exempt income tax least five years main aim provision curry favor wealthy global football governing body fifa whose headquarters currently zurich switzerland opened branch paris hopes expand employing around people compared around currently absence favorable tax environment branch may leave france proposed tax break problematic several respects legal front council state warned september amendment could introduce breach tax equality legislators sought circumvent obstacle limiting tax benefits time nonetheless constitutional council could also rule legality measure timeliness amendment also questionable purely fiscal point view fifas current employees pay taxes switzerland organization benefits tax rate incongruous france enter race bottom country benefit employees part well paid organization churns billions france little budgetary room maneuver move looks like political blunder finally idea raise frances profile giving fifa greater presence paris entirely convincing given federations tarnished reputation president gianni infantino two separate criminal investigations switzerland paris public financial investigators looking possible corruption awarding world cup qatar already issued indictments international arrest warrant former fifa executive unbridled race expansion boost revenues sus cronyism opaque governance awarding competitions problematic laxity defending sporting values human rights fifa way guest likely enhance frances prestige things considered fair say renaissance parliamentarians amendment worth risk,sinc elect presid emmanuel macron made franc attract one pillar econom polici strategi built around seri tax regulatori reform aim encourag invest employ french territori laudabl commit take new dimens ambit attract intern sport feder recogn intern olym mp macron renaiss parti discreetli tabl amend effect budget bill current discuss approv parliament propos roll red carpet around feder exempt corpor tax properti tax corpor valu ad tax addit employe feder base franc would exempt incom tax least five year main aim provis curri favor wealthi global footbal govern bodi fifa whose headquart current zurich switzerland open branch pari hope expand employ around peopl compar around current absenc favor tax environ branch may leav franc propos tax break problemat sever respect legal front council state warn septemb amend could introduc breach tax equal legisl sought circumv obstacl limit tax benefit time nonetheless constitut council could also rule legal measur timeli amend also question pure fiscal point view fifa current employe pay tax switzerland organ benefit tax rate incongru franc enter race bottom countri benefit employe part well paid organ churn billion franc littl budgetari room maneuv move look like polit blunder final idea rais franc profil give fifa greater presenc pari entir convinc given feder tarnish reput presid gianni infantino two separ crimin investig switzerland pari public financi investig look possibl corrupt award world cup qatar alreadi issu indict intern arrest warrant former fifa execut unbridl race expans boost revenu su cronyism opaqu govern award competit problemat laxiti defend sport valu human right fifa way guest like enhanc franc prestig thing consid fair say renaiss parliamentarian amend worth risk
Champions League: Lens salvages draw as Manchester United clinches last-minute win,    Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-1 victory in Istanbul on Tuesday while Jude Bellingham led Real Madrid to a 2-1 victory over Braga in Portugal and Arsenal bounced back to beat Sevilla. ,"Forward Elye Wahi salvaged a 1-1 draw for Lens against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Tuesday, October 24, in a disappointing result for the French team after its surprise win over Arsenal in the previous round of games. Przemyslaw Frankowski provided a cross for Wahi to volley in an equalizer in the 65th minute of the Group B game. ""I would have loved to win the game, that was the goal but ... proud of the team for coming back after going 1-0 down,"" Lens defender Kevin Danso said.Johan Bakayoko had put the Dutch visitors ahead. The 20-year-old Belgium forward broke the deadlock nine minutes into the second half with an angled attempt inside the far post for his first Champions League goal. ""Our destiny is still in our own hands,"" Bakayoko told RTL 7. ""But we do have to beat Lens in Eindhoven, and hopefully that's exactly what we'll do."" In the first half, PSV survived initial pressure from Lens before coming close when forward Hirving Lozano hit the post of Brice Samba's goal with another angled shot.Lens extended its unbeaten Champions League streak to three, with a win and two draws. It's the third appearance for the club from northern France in Europe's top club competition after the 1998-89 and 2002-03 seasons.Andre Onana's last-gasp penalty save secured a vital Champions League win for Manchester United against FC Copenhagen on Tuesday. Before kick-off at Old Trafford, United held a minute's silence in memory of Bobby Charlton after the Red Devils legend died on Saturday at the age of 86.They marked the occasion by claiming their first points in Group A as Harry Maguire's 72nd-minute header secured a 1-0 win. The result keeps alive their chances of advancing to the last 16 but they needed Onana to produce a brilliant save from Jordan Larsson's 97th-minute penalty to see the game out.The spot-kick was awarded when Scott McTominay caught Mohamed Elyounoussi as he tried to hook a ball clear in the box, but Larsson – whose father Henrik briefly played for United in 2007 – could not convert the chance. ""It is incredible and a great night. Especially in the dying second when you concede a penalty, but a brilliant save from Andre Onana,"" coach Erik ten Hag told broadcaster TNT Sports.United are now back in contention to qualify but Bayern look set to run away with the group after making it three wins out of three with a 3-1 victory in Istanbul. Kingsley Coman's early opener for the German champions was canceled out by a Mauro Icardi penalty on the half-hour mark. But Bayern pulled away in the second half, with Kane finishing in the 73rd minute to restore the visitors' lead with his 11th goal in 12 games for his new club. He then set up Jamal Musiala to wrap up the win.Bayern have now won 16 consecutive matches in the Champions League group phase and have not lost at this stage in over six years. ""I don't know how many group stage matches I've done as a coach, but it's always super difficult – so it's great to find ourselves with nine points after three matches,"" said Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel.Madrid, the record 14-time European champions, also have three wins out of three in Group C after Rodrygo and Bellingham scored in a 2-1 victory over Braga in Portugal. Real coach Carlo Ancelotti was taking charge of his 200th game in the competition and he saw Rodrygo open the scoring on 16 minutes before Bellingham fired in just past the hour mark.It was the England midfielder's third goal in as many Champions League games for his new club, and his 11th in 12 matches altogether since signing from Borussia Dortmund. Alvaro Djalo pulled one back for Braga, but Real can secure qualification for the last 16 when they host the Portuguese side next.Napoli are second in the group after a 1-0 win at Union Berlin, who are still without a point. Giacomo Raspadori scored the only goal in the second half as the Italian champions won without star striker Victor Osimhen.In Group B, Arsenal bounced back from losing 2-1 to Lens in France in their last game as they beat Sevilla by the same scoreline on a sodden surface at the Sanchez Pizjuan. Gabriel Martinelli ran clear to open the scoring in first-half stoppage time and a fantastic strike by Gabriel Jesus made it two.Nemanja Gudelj pulled one back for Sevilla but last season's Europa League winners have won just twice in 13 games in this campaign. ""There are not many teams to have won here in the last ten years in Europe and we've done it,"" Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta told TNT Sports.Last season's beaten finalists Inter Milan are joint top of Group D with seven points after defeating Red Bull Salzburg 2-1 at San Siro. Hakan Calhanoglu's second-half penalty won it for Inter after Alexis Sanchez's opener was canceled out by young Israeli Oscar Gloukh.Real Sociedad are level with Inter thanks to a 1-0 win over Benfica in Lisbon secured by a Brais Mendez goal. Benfica are still without a point and staring at an early exit.",Sports,forward elye wahi salvaged draw lens psv eindhoven champions league tuesday october disappointing result french team surprise

Victor Wembanyama to shine a spotlight on fellow French NBA players,"    After years without a major sensation, French basketball is set to grab the attention of the American public thanks to the emergence of 'Wemby.' Here are the French players to watch in this NBA season. ","The 2023 NBA Draft in June was a historic one: Victor Wembanyama, selected by the San Antonio Spurs, became the first Frenchman selected first overall in this expansive talent pool for young basketball prospects. He was closely followed by compatriot Bilal Coulibaly who was picked in seventh by the Washington Wizards. Never before have two Frenchmen been selected in the top 10 before. With Rayan Rupert (Portland Trailblazers) and Sidy Cissoko (San Antonio Spurs) selected 43rd and 44th respectively, France even came close to its 2016 record, when five players were drafted.Newly arrived in Texas, Wembanyama has declared his desire to ""start a French reign"" over international basketball. To achieve his goal, the alien – as the superstar LeBron James likes to call him – will be able to rely on many compatriots in the prestigious North American league. As the game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Denver Nuggets kicks off the season on Tuesday, October 24, we take a look at the Bleus of the NBA.The players haven't even officially returned to the hardwoods yet but he's already the center of attention. Wembanyama will be the star attraction of the 2023-2024 season. ""I've never seen anything like it in my life. If all goes well, he's going to revolutionize the game,"" said the NBA consultant Frédéric Weis, who will be commenting the prodigy's entire season on beIN Sports. ""With Tony Parker, we had a taste of the media impact this could generate. But this is clearly the next step. One of the best players in the world will be French.""In addition to being the superstar of the San Antonio Spurs, the former Metropolitans 92 player from Boulogne-Levallois (Paris suburbs) will have the difficult task of being French basketball's ambassador in the American league. ""He's the real change: He's going to put the spotlight back on all the other French players,"" said Jacques Monclar, another consultant for BeIN Sports.""I even think he'll be a link between the youngsters and the older members of the French team,"" added Weis. If Nicolas Batum, his captain in the national team, is to be believed, the 19-year-old seems ready to take on this mantle: ""He has the mindset and the talent to cope with all this pressure.""As for the French team's senior members, they'll be doing their best to ease concerns before the Olympics. This is particularly true of Evan Fournier. The guard, a benchmark for French players in the NBA, is going through a difficult time with the New York Knicks. At the end of last season, his coach even insinuated that they were performing better after he was taken out of the rotation. Despite some good preseason games, the Île-de-France native's future remains unclear when he returns to competition.",Sports,nba draft june historic one victor wembanyama selected san antonio spurs became first frenchman selected first overall expansive talent pool young basketball prospects closely followed compatriot bilal coulibaly seventh washington wizards never two frenchmen selected top rayan rupert portland trailblazers sidy cissoko san antonio spurs selected respectively france even came close record five players drafted newly arrived texas wembanyama declared desire start french reign international basketball achieve goal alien superstar lebron james likes call able rely many compatriots prestigious north american league game los angeles lakers denver nuggets kicks season tuesday october take look bleus nba players havent even officially returned hardwoods yet hes already center attention wembanyama star attraction season ive never seen anything like life goes well hes going revolutionize game said nba consultant ric weis commenting prodigys entire season bein sports tony parker taste media impact could generate clearly next step one best players world french addition superstar san antonio spurs former metropolitans player boulogne levallois paris suburbs difficult task french basketballs ambassador american league hes real change hes going put spotlight back french players said jacques monclar another consultant bein sports even think hell link youngsters older members french team added weis nicolas batum captain national team believed year old seems ready take mantle mindset talent cope pressure french teams senior members theyll best ease concerns olym particularly true evan fournier guard benchmark french players nba going difficult time new york knicks end last season coach even insinuated performing better taken rotation despite good preseason games france natives future remains unclear returns competition,nba draft june histor one victor wembanyama select san antonio spur becam first frenchman select first overal expans talent pool young basketbal prospect close follow compatriot bilal coulibali seventh washington wizard never two frenchmen select top rayan rupert portland trailblaz sidi cissoko san antonio spur select respect franc even came close record five player draft newli arriv texa wembanyama declar desir start french reign intern basketbal achiev goal alien superstar lebron jame like call abl reli mani compatriot prestigi north american leagu game lo angel laker denver nugget kick season tuesday octob take look bleu nba player havent even offici return hardwood yet he alreadi center attent wembanyama star attract season ive never seen anyth like life goe well he go revolution game said nba consult ric wei comment prodigi entir season bein sport toni parker tast media impact could gener clearli next step one best player world french addit superstar san antonio spur former metropolitan player boulogn levalloi pari suburb difficult task french basketbal ambassador american leagu he real chang he go put spotlight back french player said jacqu monclar anoth consult bein sport even think hell link youngster older member french team ad wei nicola batum captain nation team believ year old seem readi take mantl mindset talent cope pressur french team senior member theyll best eas concern olym particularli true evan fournier guard benchmark french player nba go difficult time new york knick end last season coach even insinu perform better taken rotat despit good preseason game franc nativ futur remain unclear return competit
Tour de France: 2024 Florence-Nice route announced,"    The new route is set to include 3,492 km of road, two Alpine crossings, a time trial finish from Monaco, and the highest starting altitude of any Tour de France. ","High altitude, an Italian debut in Florence and a finale on the French Riviera are on the itinerary of the 3,492-kilometer route for the 2024 Tour de France unveiled on Wednesday, October 25.The route embarks from Florence on June 29 and features four high-altitude finishes as the race crosses the Alps twice and squeezes in two time trials, including a potential high drama final day run from Monaco to Nice on July 21. It is the first time the race does not finish in Paris which is off-limits as it prepares to host the Olympic Games.As spectacular as it is atypical, the route was revealed at a Gala overseen by Christian Prudhomme, president of Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO, the organizers of the Tour), before almost 4000 guests and many of the expected competitors, mayors from along the route and a large press pack at a conference center in Paris.The Florence start and Nice finish were already known, prompting much excitement about not only the first-ever Grand Depart in Italy, but the race's first-ever finale outside Paris. ""It's difficult to replace Paris, so what better scenery could we give than a dazzling Monaco to Nice time trial,"" said Prudhomme.Instead of the traditional last-day parade along the Champs-Elysées, fans can instead anticipate a potentially decisive individual time trial down the Riviera coastline and in the hills between Monaco and Nice. The stage brings to mind the 1989 edition when American rider Greg LeMond beat Laurent Fignon by eight seconds on a last-day dash.After the Florence start, the race takes in Rimini on the Adriatic coast before cutting across Italy via Bologna and Turin and into France via the Alps on stage four. ""The Tour has never climbed so high, so early,"" said Prudhomme. ""The panoramas in the high Alps are just splendid.""

Swiss probe into FIFA chief Infantino dropped,"    Gianni Infantino was suspected of collusion with Switzerland's top prosecutor, who was investigating a major corruption scandal at FIFA. ","Swiss prosecutors announced Thursday, October 26, they have dropped their three-year criminal proceedings against FIFA president Gianni Infantino over suspected collusion with officials concerning the corruption scandal that engulfed world football's governing body.A probe was opened in July 2020 to investigate suspicions of collusion between Infantino and Switzerland's then-attorney general Michael Lauber, the country's top prosecutor. Lauber was in charge of Switzerland's probe into the towering corruption scandal that exploded at the heart of Zurich-based FIFA in 2015. But he was forced to recuse himself from the investigation in June 2019, following media revelations that he had held several undeclared meetings with Infantino during the probe.Two special prosecutors were assigned to the case, but in a statement Thursday, they said the investigation had closed, with the allegations refuted. ""The criminal proceedings... are discontinued,"" the statement said. ""The suspicion of instrumentalization of the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland by FIFA has not been substantiated in the course of the comprehensive investigation. ""On the contrary, the suspicion was refuted.""In a statement, FIFA noted its ""extreme satisfaction"" with the decision, saying the only surprise was how long it had taken to reach an ""obvious conclusion.""  For his part, Infantino, 53, said it was a ""full and clear victory for me, for the new FIFA and for justice.""""Indeed and with no surprise, the investigation fully and clearly confirms that I have always acted in a lawful and correct way, always defending exclusively the interests of FIFA and football,"" he said, demanded an apology from what he called the ""envious and corrupt"" people out to tarnish his reputation.",Sports,swiss prosecutors announced thursday october dropped three year criminal proceedings fifa president gianni infantino suspected collusion officials concerning corruption scandal engulfed world footballs governing body probe opened july investigate sus collusion infantino switzerlands attorney general michael lauber countrys top prosecutor lauber charge switzerlands probe towering corruption scandal exploded heart zurich based fifa forced recuse investigation june following media revelations held several undeclared meetings infantino probe two special prosecutors assigned case statement thursday said investigation closed allegations refuted criminal proceedings discontinued statement said sus instrumentalization office attorney general switzerland fifa substantiated course comprehensive investigation contrary sus refuted statement fifa noted extreme satisfaction decision saying surprise long taken reach obvious conclusion part infantino said full clear victory new fifa justice indeed surprise investigation fully clearly confirms always acted lawful correct way always defending exclusively interests fifa football said demanded apology called envious corrupt people tarnish reputation,swiss prosecutor announc thursday octob drop three year crimin proceed fifa presid gianni infantino suspect collus offici concern corrupt scandal engulf world footbal govern bodi probe open juli investig su collus infantino switzerland attorney gener michael lauber countri top prosecutor lauber charg switzerland probe tower corrupt scandal explod heart zurich base fifa forc recus investig june follow media revel held sever undeclar meet infantino probe two special prosecutor assign case statement thursday said investig close alleg refut crimin proceed discontinu statement said su instrument offic attorney gener switzerland fifa substanti cours comprehens investig contrari su refut statement fifa note extrem satisfact decis say surpris long taken reach obviou conclus part infantino said full clear victori new fifa justic inde surpris investig fulli clearli confirm alway act law correct way alway defend exclus interest fifa footbal said demand apolog call enviou corrupt peopl tarnish reput
Rugby World Cup: England defeat Argentina to finish in third place,    Captain Owen Farrell kicked 16 points for England as clung on to beat Argentina 26-23 on Friday. ,"England finished third at the Rugby World Cup for the first time by stopping waves of late Argentina attacks and prevailing 26-23 in their riveting playoff on Friday, October 27. The Pumas brought the game alive by rallying from 13-0 down to lead by one point straight after halftime. England hit straight back and stayed in front just enough thanks to the boot of captain Owen Farrell, who was mercilessly booed all night. In the last five minutes, the Pumas missed a late penalty to tie the score and England replacement George Ford pulled off a try-saving tackle on wing Mateo Carreras.Third place will give England comfort after it was written off before the tournament. England and Argentina combined for only three wins in nine matches in the Six Nations and Rugby Championship but scratched their way out of the same pool to reach the semifinals in the easier half of the World Cup draw. Seven weeks after their drab pool game in which 14-man England beat Argentina on goal kicks, the same teams gave a wholehearted effort on Friday that showed they dearly wanted the bronze medal.Playing Sam Underhill and Tom Curry together in a World Cup game for the first time since the 2019 final paid dividends for England in an attritional first half. They were England's top two tacklers and got the only two turnovers in a first half that was fairly even except on the scoreboard. Curry was superb in a week when he and his family were abused online for complaining he was the subject of a racial slur from South Africa during the semifinals last weekend. Underhill, an emergency replacement playing his first test in more than a year, played like a man who should have started more for England lately.Marcus Smith was on hand to send No. 8 Ben Earl through a gap and soft defense for the opening try. Farrell's conversion and two penalties sent England ahead 13-0. Argentina thought it was playing a Barbarians game and gave up two kickable penalties to try a lineout and scrum, both of which were wasted. The next penalty, though, was kicked over by Emiliano Boffelli, which pleased a crowd of 77,647 giving the Pumas partisan support. Farrell kicked England 16-3 ahead, and just when the game was plodding along, it was given a welcome lift by the Pumas, who swept down the left touchline and finished with scrumhalf Tomas Cubelli diving off a ruck through English legs to score.The game really came alive straight after halftime when, out of nothing, Pumas flyhalf Santiago Carreras slipped front-rowers Theo Dan and Ellis Genge and glided around Smith to score between the posts. But Carreras immediately undid his brilliant work when he was charged down by Dan, who picked up and scored. Farrell and Boffelli had the posts zeroed in all night, combining for a perfect 10 out of 10 goal kicks. Their penalties plus a penalty by replacement Sanchez pushed the score to 26-23 with 12 minutes to go.The minutes were dominated by Argentina but Sanchez pulled his second chance from wide out, and Ford smothered Carreras when he was tearing for the line. It finished the best third-place game since 2007, when Argentina beat host France, and gave England a full set of World Cup medals after gold in 2003 and silvers in 2007 and 2019.",Sports,england finished third rugby world cup first time stopping waves late argentina attacks prevailing riveting playoff friday october pumas brought game alive rallying lead one point straight halftime england hit straight back stayed front enough thanks boot captain owen farrell mercilessly booed night last five minutes pumas missed late penalty tie score england replacement george ford pulled try saving tackle wing mateo carreras third place give england comfort written tournament england argentina combined three wins nine matches six nations rugby championship scratched way pool reach semifinals easier half world cup draw seven weeks drab pool game man england beat argentina goal kicks teams gave wholehearted effort friday showed dearly wanted bronze medal playing sam underhill tom curry together world cup game first time since final paid dividends england attritional first half englands top two tacklers got two turnovers first half fairly even except scoreboard curry superb week family abused online complaining subject racial slur south africa semifinals last weekend underhill emergency replacement playing first test year played like man started england lately marcus smith hand send ben earl gap soft defense opening try farrells conversion two penalties sent england ahead argentina thought playing barbarians game gave two kickable penalties try lineout scrum wasted next penalty though kicked emiliano boffelli pleased crowd giving pumas partisan support farrell kicked england ahead game plodding along given welcome lift pumas swept left touchline finished scrumhalf tomas cubelli diving ruck english legs score game really came alive straight halftime nothing pumas flyhalf santiago carreras slipped front rowers theo dan ellis genge glided around smith score posts carreras immediately undid brilliant work charged dan scored farrell boffelli posts zeroed night combining perfect goal kicks penalties plus penalty replacement sanchez pushed score minutes minutes dominated argentina sanchez pulled second chance wide ford smothered carreras tearing line finished best third place game since argentina beat host france gave england full set world cup medals gold silvers,england finish third rugbi world cup first time stop wave late argentina attack prevail rivet playoff friday octob puma brought game aliv ralli lead one point straight halftim england hit straight back stay front enough thank boot captain owen farrel mercilessli boo night last five minut puma miss late penalti tie score england replac georg ford pull tri save tackl wing mateo carrera third place give england comfort written tournament england argentina combin three win nine match six nation rugbi championship scratch way pool reach semifin easier half world cup draw seven week drab pool game man england beat argentina goal kick team gave wholeheart effort friday show dearli want bronz medal play sam underhil tom curri togeth world cup game first time sinc final paid dividend england attrit first half england top two tackler got two turnov first half fairli even except scoreboard curri superb week famili abus onlin complain subject racial slur south africa semifin last weekend underhil emerg replac play first test year play like man start england late marcu smith hand send ben earl gap soft defens open tri farrel convers two penalti sent england ahead argentina thought play barbarian game gave two kickabl penalti tri lineout scrum wast next penalti though kick emiliano boffelli pleas crowd give puma partisan support farrel kick england ahead game plod along given welcom lift puma swept left touchlin finish scrumhalf toma cubelli dive ruck english leg score game realli came aliv straight halftim noth puma flyhalf santiago carrera slip front rower theo dan elli geng glide around smith score post carrera immedi undid brilliant work charg dan score farrel boffelli post zero night combin perfect goal kick penalti plu penalti replac sanchez push score minut minut domin argentina sanchez pull second chanc wide ford smother carrera tear line finish best third place game sinc argentina beat host franc gave england full set world cup medal gold silver
Victor Wembanyama frustrated and promising in mixed NBA debut,"    With a highly anticipated league debut, the number one draft pick delivered a mixed performance in the San Antonio Spurs' 126-119 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. ","Sport is never more beautiful than when the crowd becomes an actor in the game. When Victor Wembanyama blocked Kyrie Irving and followed that up with a three-pointer at the top of the key almost from the outset on Wednesday, October 25, the decibels in the arena shot up. Very quickly, very loudly, the hearts of the 19,000 Spurs fans started to beat faster, as the walls of San Antonio's Frost Bank Center shook. They were all already crazy about ""Wemby,"" the French phenomenon who had just scored his first NBA points. In the front row, his parents, his sister Eve – wearing a black T-shirt with the front page of the US magazine Slam featuring the French player – and his agents enjoyed the event. ""It was a surreal moment,"" hailed Wembanyama after the Spurs' opening loss to the Dallas Mavericks (126-119). ""I just feel very lucky to be here.""By far the most acclaimed player on his warm-up appearance, the 2.21m giant got into his stride before being heavily penalized for fouls in his first official NBA outing (15 points in 23 minutes). Closely monitored by the defense, the 19-year-old athlete was hampered by the special treatment reserved for him by the Dallas Mavericks. Intrigued by the phenomenon, Luka Doncic – the opposing team's superstar – and his teammates trained all week with arm extensions to better negotiate Wembanyama's 2.43 m wingspan.""Maybe I wanted to do too well, not to put my energy into the right things,"" admitted the number one draft pick, sounding discouraged. ""I don't need to put that much energy into defense. I'm learning for a first game."" Although his NBA debut was less accomplished than his preseason, Wemby showed promise at the very end of the match when Dallas thought they had it in the bag. A three-pointer kept the Spurs in the game (110-108, 42""), sending chants of ""Go Spurs Go"" roaring down from the stands and reviving the crowd, which was a little turned off and disheartened by the numerous loose balls of its protégés (12, in the end).""It would have been complicated for him to finish with an unfinished game on both sides of the court,"" analyzed former French international Ian Mahinmi. For the former Spurs player (from 2007 to 2010) who still lives in San Antonio, despite a complicated match, Wembanyama's second half ""shows that he has character and the soul of a leader. That's important and bodes well for the future.""The former Rouen pivot was far from the only French player present at the Frost Bank Center for the long-awaited debut of the tricolor ""unicorn."" Fabien Garcia, defender of San Antonio FC in the USL (2nd division), was also on hand, as were numerous basketball fans who had traveled thousands of miles to be present for the ""historic moment."" The Spurs, too, are increasingly French-speaking, having already gained notoriety in France during the Tony Parker era (from 2001 to 2018). ""I promise, I'll learn a few words in French this season,"" slipped Rita Pasiear, one of the venue's employees, just outside the players' entrance corridor.",Sports,sport never beautiful crowd becomes actor game victor wembanyama blocked kyrie irving followed three pointer top key almost outset wednesday october decibels arena shot quickly loudly hearts spurs fans started beat faster walls san antonios frost bank center shook already crazy wemby french phenomenon scored first nba points front row parents sister eve wearing black shirt front page magazine slam featuring french player agents enjoyed event surreal moment hailed wembanyama spurs opening loss dallas mavericks feel lucky far acclaimed player warm appearance giant got stride heavily penalized fouls first official nba outing points minutes closely monitored defense year old athlete hampered special treatment reserved dallas mavericks intrigued phenomenon luka doncic opposing teams superstar teammates trained week arm extensions better negotiate wembanyamas wingspan maybe wanted well put energy right things admitted number one draft sounding discouraged dont need put much energy defense learning first game although nba debut less accomplished preseason wemby showed promise end match dallas thought bag three pointer kept spurs game sending chants spurs roaring stands reviving crowd little turned disheartened numerous loose balls prot end would complicated finish unfinished game sides court analyzed former french international ian mahinmi former spurs player still lives san antonio despite complicated match wembanyamas second half shows character soul leader thats important bodes well future former rouen pivot far french player present frost bank center long awaited debut tricolor unicorn fabien garcia defender san antonio usl division also hand numerous basketball fans traveled thousands miles present historic moment spurs increasingly french speaking already gained notoriety france tony parker era promise ill learn words french season slipped rita pasiear one venues employees outside players entrance corridor,sport never beauti crowd becom actor game victor wembanyama block kyri irv follow three pointer top key almost outset wednesday octob decibel arena shot quickli loudli heart spur fan start beat faster wall san antonio frost bank center shook alreadi crazi wembi french phenomenon score first nba point front row parent sister eve wear black shirt front page magazin slam featur french player agent enjoy event surreal moment hail wembanyama spur open loss dalla maverick feel lucki far acclaim player warm appear giant got stride heavili penal foul first offici nba outing point minut close monitor defens year old athlet hamper special treatment reserv dalla maverick intrigu phenomenon luka doncic oppos team superstar teammat train week arm extens better negoti wembanyama wingspan mayb want well put energi right thing admit number one draft sound discourag dont need put much energi defens learn first game although nba debut less accomplish preseason wembi show promis end match dalla thought bag three pointer kept spur game send chant spur roar stand reviv crowd littl turn dishearten numer loos ball prot end would complic finish unfinish game side court analyz former french intern ian mahinmi former spur player still live san antonio despit complic match wembanyama second half show charact soul leader that import bode well futur former rouen pivot far french player present frost bank center long await debut tricolor unicorn fabien garcia defend san antonio usl divis also hand numer basketbal fan travel thousand mile present histor moment spur increasingli french speak alreadi gain notorieti franc toni parker era promis ill learn word french season slip rita pasiear one venu employe outsid player entranc corridor
Rugby profits from growing enthusiasm from sponsors,In Depth,"Of course, the results tell one story: Les Bleus were eliminated from the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals on Sunday, October 15. The Tricolor dream was shattered, and the party was already a little over. On Saturday, October 28, it will be over for good. After the closing ceremony, hosted by the singer Mika at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, South Africa and New Zealand will take the field for the final match. The victorious team will lift the Webb Ellis trophy, and a photo will immortalize the moment.A sad end for France, the host country? ""No, not at all. The adventure continues, more than ever,"" enthused Florian Grill, who was elected in June to head the French Rugby Federation (FFR), an organization that is currently running a deficit. The 58-year-old talks fast and has so much to say and to propose, all in service of convincing people of the benefits of a sport that he played as a young man before attending HEC business school, from which he graduated. ""This World Cup shows just how much the values of rugby – conviviality, solidarity, respect, in short, living better together – are precious and good for society. The public's unprecedented enthusiasm is promising, although I do regret our players' loss. But they're ready to bounce back, have no doubt about that.""Next week, the French sporting authorities will take stock of the enthusiasm generated by the international competition. A few clues set the tone. On that fateful October 15, nearly 16.5 million viewers tuned in to TF1 to watch the match that ended the hopes of the French national team, defeated by the Springboks. Uptil now, this was the channel's highest ratings for the year. Women are increasingly evident, both in front of the screen and in the stands, where they now make up 30% of supporters. The most optimistic forecasts also predict 600,000 foreign visitors and almost €1.5 billion in economic benefits for France. Above all, rugby's popularity is set to rise among businesses, who are sure that financially supporting the game won't lead to burned fingers. The sense of ""team spirit"" at the heart of the game is, in an ideal world, the key to employee motivation and cohesion.Let's be clear: There's no question here of romanticizing the sport by making it into a paragon of virtue. There are dark sides to rugby, starting with the long-ignored scourge of dangerous concussions caused by violent blows to the head and a lack of protection for players. Similarly, the two-year suspended prison sentence given to former FFR president Bernard Laporte for corruption in December 2022 – he has appealed – is a cause for caution. Insults and even punches are thrown on the fields, as this sport is not always played by gentlemen.",Sports,course results tell one story les bleus eliminated rugby world cup quarter finals sunday october tricolor dream shattered party already little saturday october good closing ceremony hosted singer mika stade france saint denis south africa new zealand take field final match victorious team lift webb ellis trophy photo immortalize moment sad end france host country adventure continues ever enthused florian grill elected june head french rugby federation ffr organization currently running deficit year old talks fast much say propose service convincing people benefits sport played young man attending hec business school graduated world cup shows much values rugby conviviality solidarity respect short living better together precious good society publics unprecedented enthusiasm promising although regret players loss theyre ready bounce back doubt next week french sporting authorities take stock enthusiasm generated international competition clues set tone fateful october nearly million viewers tuned watch match ended hopes french national team defeated springboks uptil channels highest ratings year women increasingly evident front screen stands make supporters optimistic forecasts also predict foreign visitors almost billion economic benefits france rugbys popularity set rise among businesses sure financially supporting game wont lead burned fingers sense team spirit heart game ideal world key employee motivation cohesion lets clear theres question romanticizing sport making paragon virtue dark sides rugby starting long ignored scourge dangerous concussions caused violent blows head lack protection players similarly two year suspended prison sentence given former ffr president bernard laporte corruption december appealed cause caution insults even punches thrown fields sport always played gentlemen,cours result tell one stori le bleu elimin rugbi world cup quarter final sunday octob tricolor dream shatter parti alreadi littl saturday octob good close ceremoni host singer mika stade franc saint deni south africa new zealand take field final match victori team lift webb elli trophi photo immort moment sad end franc host countri adventur continu ever enthus florian grill elect june head french rugbi feder ffr organ current run deficit year old talk fast much say propos servic convinc peopl benefit sport play young man attend hec busi school graduat world cup show much valu rugbi convivi solidar respect short live better togeth preciou good societi public unpreced enthusiasm promis although regret player loss theyr readi bounc back doubt next week french sport author take stock enthusiasm gener intern competit clue set tone fate octob nearli million viewer tune watch match end hope french nation team defeat springbok uptil channel highest rate year women increasingli evid front screen stand make support optimist forecast also predict foreign visitor almost billion econom benefit franc rugbi popular set rise among busi sure financi support game wont lead burn finger sens team spirit heart game ideal world key employe motiv cohes let clear there question romantic sport make paragon virtu dark side rugbi start long ignor scourg danger concuss caus violent blow head lack protect player similarli two year suspend prison sentenc given former ffr presid bernard laport corrupt decemb appeal caus caution insult even punch thrown field sport alway play gentlemen
Tyson Fury-Francis Ngannou fight: Why Saudi Arabia is entering the ring,"    On Saturday, the English boxing match between the Briton and the Cameroonian mixed martial artist will kick off the 2023 edition of the Riyadh Season, a festival organized in the Saudi capital. ","Have you heard of Riyadh Season? Contrary to what one might think, it's not the name of a luxury hotel or of a restaurant that just opened on the Champs-Elysées in Paris, but a major festival organized in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital. For several months, the city will host a series of spectacles, huge shows and sporting events.The 2023 event kicks off on Saturday, October 28, with an English boxing match between Britain's Tyson Fury, the world champion of the noble art, and Cameroon's Francis Ngannou, a former heavyweight champion of the UFC – the world's biggest mixed martial arts (MMA) league. These two superstar fighters from different sports will share the same ring.The choice of a fistfight to launch the kingdom's largest sporting and cultural event is no accident. In addition to soccer, Formula 1 and other festivities, Saudi Arabia has also invested in combat sports in recent years. When Fury and Ngannou agreed to fight, the Saudis ""showed interest, organization and logistics,"" explained the Cameroonian giant to Le Monde.This is hardly surprising given the kingdom's recent track record. In 2019, the rematch between the Englishman Anthony Joshua and the American Andy Ruiz took place at Riyadh's Diriyah Arena, a 15,000-seat venue built for the occasion. The SRJ investment fund, a branch of the almighty Public Investment Fund (PIF, $620 billion in assets by 2022), recently became a minority shareholder in MMA's up-and-coming global league, the PFL. And there are also rumors among specialists that the UFC will hold its first event on Saudi soil in 2024.Raphaël Le Magoariec has studied the strategy of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as ""MBS"": ""There's a desire to broaden the range of disciplines in order to become a pole of attraction,"" said the geopolitical scientist from the University of Tours and Persian Gulf specialist. ""And it's being done with sports that are becoming increasingly popular on a global and regional scale, reaching a population that previously saw it as violent."" This strategy echoes the country's buying frenzy of European soccer players this summer, but with one added benefit: As it is still in its infancy, MMA is a less expensive and less competitive investment than football.The PIF's financial strike force also has the power to make everything easier. ""It's a bit complicated in boxing. Everyone has their own promotion and fight organization,"" Ngannou explained. ""We wanted to do this fight, but it wasn't easy until Saudi Arabia got involved. We were trying to get a date at Wembley in England (...) From the day they became interested, nothing was left as a simple promise, everything came to pass.""",Sports,heard riyadh season contrary one might think name luxury hotel restaurant opened champs elys paris major festival organized riyadh saudi arabias capital several months city host series spectacles huge shows sporting events event kicks saturday october english boxing match britains tyson fury world champion noble art cameroons francis ngannou former heavyweight champion ufc worlds biggest mixed martial arts mma league two superstar fighters different sports share ring choice fistfight launch kingdoms largest sporting cultural event accident addition soccer formula festivities saudi arabia also invested combat sports recent years fury ngannou agreed fight saudis showed interest organization logistics explained cameroonian giant monde hardly surprising given kingdoms recent track record rematch englishman anthony joshua american andy ruiz took place riyadhs diriyah arena seat venue built occasion srj investment fund branch almighty public investment fund pif billion assets recently became minority shareholder mmas coming global league pfl also rumors among specialists ufc hold first event saudi soil rapha magoariec studied strategy saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman known mbs theres desire broaden range disciplines order become pole attraction said geopolitical scientist university tours persian gulf specialist done sports becoming increasingly popular global regional scale reaching population previously saw violent strategy echoes countrys buying frenzy european soccer players summer one added benefit still infancy mma less expensive less competitive investment football pifs financial strike force also power make everything easier bit complicated boxing everyone promotion fight organization ngannou explained wanted fight wasnt easy saudi arabia got involved trying get date wembley england day became interested nothing left simple promise everything came pass,heard riyadh season contrari one might think name luxuri hotel restaur open champ eli pari major festiv organ riyadh saudi arabia capit sever month citi host seri spectacl huge show sport event event kick saturday octob english box match britain tyson furi world champion nobl art cameroon franci ngannou former heavyweight champion ufc world biggest mix martial art mma leagu two superstar fighter differ sport share ring choic fistfight launch kingdom largest sport cultur event accid addit soccer formula festiv saudi arabia also invest combat sport recent year furi ngannou agre fight saudi show interest organ logist explain cameroonian giant mond hardli surpris given kingdom recent track record rematch englishman anthoni joshua american andi ruiz took place riyadh diriyah arena seat venu built occas srj invest fund branch almighti public invest fund pif billion asset recent becam minor sharehold mma come global leagu pfl also rumor among specialist ufc hold first event saudi soil rapha magoariec studi strategi saudi crown princ moham bin salman known mb there desir broaden rang disciplin order becom pole attract said geopolit scientist univers tour persian gulf specialist done sport becom increasingli popular global region scale reach popul previous saw violent strategi echo countri buy frenzi european soccer player summer one ad benefit still infanc mma less expens less competit invest footbal pif financi strike forc also power make everyth easier bit complic box everyon promot fight organ ngannou explain want fight wasnt easi saudi arabia got involv tri get date wembley england day becam interest noth left simpl promis everyth came pass
New Zealand v South Africa: The ultimate battle for world rugby supremacy,    The clash between the All Blacks and the Springboks on Saturday at the Stade de France in Paris will see one of the two teams become the first to be crowned champion a fourth time in the World Cup. ,"Just two years ago, the number would have been round, and the symbol perfect. For 102 years, since the Springboks' first match against the All Blacks in 1921, South Africa and New Zealand have been battling for supremacy in world rugby. The two flagship nations of the southern hemisphere, each winners of three World Cups – a record in this competition created in 1987 – will face off on Saturday, October 28, in the final of the World Cup in France (9 pm).""The Springboks and the All Blacks are a part of our rugby history,"" said South African assistant coach Deon Davids in the week. ""Every time we play each other it is always a special battle and I don't think this one will be different."" In 2021, New Zealand fullback Beauden Barrett recounted the moments he spent as a child with his siblings – two of whom, Scott and Jordie, will be playing alongside him in the 2023 World Cup squad. Together, they watched the All Blacks' matches against South Africa at 3 am (because of the time difference), with a cup of hot chocolate in their hands.In both countries, rugby is both the national sport and a religion. ""It's the biggest rivalry in world rugby, and not just because these are the two most successful nations in history,"" said Jamie Wall, a New Zealand journalist and author of The Hundred Years' War: All Blacks vs Springboks). ""A lot of it has to do with issues beyond sport.""Due to the apartheid regime in South Africa – and embodied by the rugby team – the two rivals' matcheshave often spilled over into the political arena. Since the late 1960s, New Zealand civil society has protested loud and clear whenever the Boks have visited the archipelago: in particular, against the All Blacks' willingness to do without their Maori players when they travel to South Africa, in order to comply with the racist rules of the local regime. ""We've gone from a shameful relationship to something much healthier, which has refocused on sporting entertainment and celebrates the best in rugby,"" said Wall.Adversaries in the final of the 1995 World Cup in South Africa – won by captain François Pienaar's Springboks, now symbols of the national reconciliation sought by Nelson Mandela – the two nations have, from that moment on, cultivated their rivalry on the pitch.

Rugby World Cup 2023: South Africa remains on top of the world after nerve-wracking final,"    The Springboks triumphed over New Zealand 12-11 on Saturday. A victory by the slimmest of margins, it made Siya Kolisi's team the most successful in history. ","All it takes is one point. After seven weeks of intense competition, the smallest difference was enough to tip the scales in favor of either ecstasy or disillusionment. And the faces on the pitch at the Stade de France on Saturday, October 28 made that abundantly clear. After an intense and nail-biting final, South Africa won the Rugby World Cup 2023 against New Zealand (12-11). Their victory was earned with a narrow one-point lead, the same as in their quarter-final against France and their semi-final against England. But it was more than enough to send captain Siya Kolisi and his teammates, the first nation to be crowned champions four times in the competition, into fourth heaven.""Coach Rassie [Johan Erasmus, South Africa's coach] said great things are never achieved in ideal conditions. And this wasn't ideal conditions for us as a group,"" explained the South African captain, who arrived singing and holding a Webb-Ellis cup at the post-match press conference. ""Playing the home team in their home country was one of the hardest things to do and obviously, when we played the last game against England, which was tight, we had to fight and today as well, no different.""South Africa didn't pile up the tries in the final phase, nor did they create a huge gap. But step by step, one point difference after another, they demonstrated their mastery right to the end of a grueling journey. ""They've had a tough run and proved they can win,"" sighed a dejected Sam Cane, the New Zealand captain. As four years earlier, the Sprinboks conquered the title despite a defeat in the group stages (to Ireland). The musicians get paid at the end of the ball and, while the orchestra led by scrum-half Faf De Klerk was anything but melodious, it stuck to its score right to the end.The rain that lashed the Stade de France before the final had dampened hopes of an airy, ambitious game. Instead, it augured an old-fashioned game of scrums, up-and-under kicks and minimalist passes. The Springboks' hand-crafted game plan, which they had been following since the start of the competition, was perfectly suited to this autumn weather.We've been here before: precise kicking to move the game around, a reliable kicker and impeccable defense. Theirs is a sterile game, which delights experts with its strategic refinement, but probably leaves most spectators on the sidelines. But nowhere in the rules of this two-hundred-year-old sport is it written that you have to play the game beautifully to win.

Football: Nine arrested for violent attack on Lyon bus in Marseille,"    Sunday night's Ligue 1 fixture between Olympique Lyonnais and Olympique de Marseille was canceled after projectiles were thrown at Lyon's bus, injuring the coach Fabio Grosso. ","French police have detained nine people and are searching for other suspects after a violent attack on buses carrying the Olympique Lyonnais team and fans left coach Fabio Grosso with a head injury and forced the postponement of its game at Marseille. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said on BFM television that five police officers were also injured in the attack Sunday night, which drew nationwide attention amid concerns about football violence.However, it's unlikely the attack will lead to disciplinary sanctions against the nine-time French champions. Since it took place outside the Vélodrome stadium, responsibility lies with public authorities and not with the club. The case has been taken over by a French league committee in charge of scheduling competitions, and not by the discipline commission.The team bus was hit on the way to the Stade Vélodrome, shattering some windows. Grosso was injured by shards of glass and needed medical treatment with his face bleeding heavily. He suffered a deep cut above his left eye that required stitches and had a large bandage wrapped around his head. Lyon assistant coach Raffaele Longo was also injured. Buses carrying Lyon fans were also attacked.The attack was been widely commented in media outside France and comes at a very bad time for the French league amid negotiations for the sale of its TV rights abroad. Earlier this month, the auction for the domestic broadcast rights for the 2024-2029 period was cancelled after the league failed to attract bids meeting the minimum price set.FIFA president Gianni Infantino said on Instagram that ""there is absolutely no place for violence in soccer, on or off the pitch"" and called on ""the competent authorities to ensure that the appropriate measures are taken.""Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra called for a ""global response"" and said the French league, the teams and fan groups should all take responsibility. Speaking Monday on France-2 television, she called for tougher restrictions on troublemakers. She and Darmanin defended police protection for the Lyon team even though the measures weren't enough to prevent the attack.Marseille president Pablo Longoria said the attack was unacceptable and the club wished Grosso a speedy recovery. ""Because of a handful of thoughtless people, tonight’s party was spoiled and 65,000 fans were deprived of attending a soccer match,"" the club said.The atmosphere has long been tense between the teams, notably since fans from Marseille and Lyon fought in a violent brawl 10 years ago that left 17 injured. Both clubs have been under pressure lately. Marseille is still showing poor form with one win and three losses in its last four league games, and Lyon is the only team still winless in the league.",Sports,french police detained nine people searching suspects violent attack buses carrying olympique lyonnais team fans left coach fabio grosso head injury forced postponement game marseille interior minister rald darmanin said bfm television five police officers also injured attack sunday night drew nationwide attention amid concerns football violence however unlikely attack lead disciplinary sanctions nine time french champions since took place outside lodrome stadium responsibility lies public authorities club case taken french league committee charge scheduling competitions discipline commission team bus hit way stade lodrome shattering windows grosso injured shards glass needed medical treatment face bleeding heavily suffered deep cut left eye required stitches large bandage wrapped around head lyon assistant coach raffaele longo also injured buses carrying lyon fans also attacked attack widely commented media outside france comes bad time french league amid negotiations sale rights abroad earlier month auction domestic broadcast rights period cancelled league failed attract bids meeting minimum price set fifa president gianni infantino said instagram absolutely place violence soccer pitch called competent authorities ensure appropriate measures taken sports minister lie oud cast called global response said french league teams fan groups take responsibility speaking monday france television called tougher restrictions troublemakers darmanin defended police protection lyon team even though measures werent enough prevent attack marseille president pablo longoria said attack unacceptable club wished grosso speedy recovery handful thoughtless people tonight party spoiled fans deprived attending soccer match club said atmosphere long tense teams notably since fans marseille lyon fought violent brawl years ago left injured clubs pressure lately marseille still showing poor form one win three losses last four league games lyon team still winless league,french polic detain nine peopl search suspect violent attack buse carri olympiqu lyonnai team fan left coach fabio grosso head injuri forc postpon game marseil interior minist rald darmanin said bfm televis five polic offic also injur attack sunday night drew nationwid attent amid concern footbal violenc howev unlik attack lead disciplinari sanction nine time french champion sinc took place outsid lodrom stadium respons lie public author club case taken french leagu committe charg schedul competit disciplin commiss team bu hit way stade lodrom shatter window grosso injur shard glass need medic treatment face bleed heavili suffer deep cut left eye requir stitch larg bandag wrap around head lyon assist coach raffael longo also injur buse carri lyon fan also attack attack wide comment media outsid franc come bad time french leagu amid negoti sale right abroad earlier month auction domest broadcast right period cancel leagu fail attract bid meet minimum price set fifa presid gianni infantino said instagram absolut place violenc soccer pitch call compet author ensur appropri measur taken sport minist lie oud cast call global respons said french leagu team fan group take respons speak monday franc televis call tougher restrict troublemak darmanin defend polic protect lyon team even though measur werent enough prevent attack marseil presid pablo longoria said attack unaccept club wish grosso speedi recoveri hand thoughtless peopl tonight parti spoil fan depriv attend soccer match club said atmospher long tens team notabl sinc fan marseil lyon fought violent brawl year ago left injur club pressur late marseil still show poor form one win three loss last four leagu game lyon team still winless leagu

Rugby World Cup: Springboks hooker Bongi Mbonambi cleared to play in  final,    England flanker Tom Curry complained of being subject to a racial slur from Bongi Mbonambi during the Rugby World Cup semifinal against South Africa at the Stade de France last weekend. ,"South Africa hooker Bongi Mbonambi was picked to play in the Rugby World Cup final after World Rugby found no evidence he racially abused an England player. Mbonambi was selected on Thursday, October 26, for the World Cup final against New Zealand on Saturday. His participation could have been jeopardized if he'd been found guilty of misconduct.The case started after England flanker Tom Curry complained of being subject to a racial slur during the Rugby World Cup semifinal against South Africa last weekend at the Stade de France.""Any allegation of discrimination is taken extremely seriously by World Rugby, warranting a thorough investigation,"" World Rugby said in a statement on Thursday. ""Having considered all the available evidence, including match footage, audio and evidence from both teams, the governing body has determined that there is insufficient evidence at this time to proceed with charges. Therefore, the matter is deemed closed unless additional evidence comes to light."" World Rugby added it believes Curry made his allegations ""in good faith, and that there is no suggestion that the allegation was deliberately false or malicious.""Curry, who was selected to play against Argentina in the third-place game on Friday, has received the support of the England team and his Sale Sharks club this week after a deluge of abuse on social media.""World Rugby is also concerned by the social media abuse that both players have been subjected to this week,” the governing body added. “There is no place in rugby or society for discrimination, abuse or hate speech, and World Rugby urges fans to embrace the sport’s values of respect, integrity and solidarity.""",Sports,south africa hooker bongi mbonambi play rugby world cup final world rugby found evidence racially abused england player mbonambi selected thursday october world cup final new zealand saturday participation could jeopardized hed found guilty misconduct case started england flanker tom curry complained subject racial slur rugby world cup semifinal south africa last weekend stade france allegation discrimination taken extremely seriously world rugby warranting thorough investigation world rugby said statement thursday considered available evidence including match footage audio evidence teams governing body determined insufficient evidence time proceed charges therefore matter deemed closed unless additional evidence comes light world rugby added believes curry made allegations good faith suggestion allegation deliberately false malicious curry selected play argentina third place game friday received support england team sale sharks club week deluge abuse social media world rugby also concerned social media abuse players subjected week governing body added place rugby society discrimination abuse hate speech world rugby urges fans embrace sport values respect integrity solidarity,south africa hooker bongi mbonambi play rugbi world cup final world rugbi found evid racial abus england player mbonambi select thursday octob world cup final new zealand saturday particip could jeopard hed found guilti misconduct case start england flanker tom curri complain subject racial slur rugbi world cup semifin south africa last weekend stade franc alleg discrimin taken extrem serious world rugbi warrant thorough investig world rugbi said statement thursday consid avail evid includ match footag audio evid team govern bodi determin insuffici evid time proceed charg therefor matter deem close unless addit evid come light world rugbi ad believ curri made alleg good faith suggest alleg deliber fals malici curri select play argentina third place game friday receiv support england team sale shark club week delug abus social media world rugbi also concern social media abus player subject week govern bodi ad place rugbi societi discrimin abus hate speech world rugbi urg fan embrac sport valu respect integr solidar
South Africa beat New Zealand 12-11 to win record fourth Rugby World Cup,    Handre Pollard kicked four penalties to help South Africa to a nail-biting victory over 14-man New Zealand in the Rugby World Cup final on Saturday to claim a record fourth title. ,"Defending champion South Africa kicked its way to a record fourth Rugby World Cup title by beating New Zealand 12-11 on Saturday, October 28, after All Blacks captain Sam Cane was the first player to be red-carded in a final.Flyhalf Handre Pollard scored all the points for a Springboks side which repeated its 1995 success over New Zealand and denied the All Blacks their own chance to win a fourth title in their record fifth final.Cane was shown the red card for a high tackle on center Jesse Kriel. Three other players were sin-binned – two Springboks and one All Black – in a chaotic match.Fullback Beauden Barrett scored the only try of the game in the left corner, setting up a tense last 20 minutes.He became the first player to score in two World Cup finals and scored the first try conceded by South Africa in a final. But flyhalf Richie Mo'unga’s touchline conversion attempt went wide and ultimately preserved the winning margin.Both sides finished with 14 players as left winger Cheslin Kolbe was sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on. Center Jordie Barrett took the penalty shot from nearly 50 meters wide of the right post but it sailed wide with Kolbe holding his head in his hands, unable to watch.Cane was sin-binned but referee Wayne Barnes pulled out the dreaded red after the punishment was upgraded late in the first half following a bunker review.The All Blacks had already had a yellow card after three minutes to flanker Shannon Frizell. Springboks captain Siya Kolisi was sin-binned early in the second half, for another high tackle, evening the numbers with the score 12-6 to South Africa.Saturday’s 106th showdown between the gigantic rivals was played on a wet field and pitted the two top-ranked sides. Tennis stars Roger Federer, wearing a South Africa scarf, and Novak Djokovic were among the crowd of 80,065 who witnessed a gripping but scrappy game.New Zealand scrumhalf Aaron Smith dived over in the left corner early in the second half but the try was ruled out. Mo’unga made a great break from midfield, dummied inside fullback Damian Willemse and fed Smith to dive over. But yet another TMO decision ruled out the try for a knock-on in the buildup.Kolisi's card was not upgraded and he came back on moments later with 25 minutes left to play. New Zealand was on top and a brilliant improvised one-handed looping pass from Jordie Barrett found wing Mark Tele’a, and he slipped two tackles before feeding Beauden Barrett in the left corner.It gave New Zealand hope, but in the end Kolisi became only the second skipper to lead a team to back-to-back World Cup victories after New Zealand great Richie McCaw.",Sports,defending champion south africa kicked way record fourth rugby world cup title beating new zealand saturday october blacks captain sam cane first player red carded final flyhalf handre pollard scored points springboks side repeated success new zealand denied blacks chance win fourth title record fifth final cane shown red card high tackle center jesse kriel three players sin binned two springboks one black chaotic match fullback beauden barrett scored try game left corner setting tense last minutes became first player score two world cup finals scored first try conceded south africa final flyhalf richie mounga touchline conversion attempt went wide ultimately preserved winning margin sides finished players left winger cheslin kolbe sin binned deliberate knock center jordie barrett took penalty shot nearly meters wide right post sailed wide kolbe holding head hands unable watch cane sin binned referee wayne barnes pulled dreaded red punishment upgraded late first half following bunker review blacks already yellow card three minutes flanker shannon frizell springboks captain siya kolisi sin binned early second half another high tackle evening numbers score south africa saturday showdown gigantic rivals played wet field pitted two top ranked sides tennis stars roger federer wearing south africa scarf novak djokovic among crowd witnessed gripping scrappy game new zealand scrumhalf aaron smith dived left corner early second half try ruled unga made great break midfield dummied inside fullback damian willemse fed smith dive yet another tmo decision ruled try knock buildup kolisis card upgraded came back moments later minutes left play new zealand top brilliant improvised one handed looping pass jordie barrett found wing mark tele slipped two tackles feeding beauden barrett left corner gave new zealand hope end kolisi became second skipper lead team back back world cup victories new zealand great richie mccaw,defend champion south africa kick way record fourth rugbi world cup titl beat new zealand saturday octob black captain sam cane first player red card final flyhalf handr pollard score point springbok side repeat success new zealand deni black chanc win fourth titl record fifth final cane shown red card high tackl center jess kriel three player sin bin two springbok one black chaotic match fullback beauden barrett score tri game left corner set tens last minut becam first player score two world cup final score first tri conced south africa final flyhalf richi mounga touchlin convers attempt went wide ultim preserv win margin side finish player left winger cheslin kolb sin bin deliber knock center jordi barrett took penalti shot nearli meter wide right post sail wide kolb hold head hand unabl watch cane sin bin refere wayn barn pull dread red punish upgrad late first half follow bunker review black alreadi yellow card three minut flanker shannon frizel springbok captain siya kolisi sin bin earli second half anoth high tackl even number score south africa saturday showdown gigant rival play wet field pit two top rank side tenni star roger feder wear south africa scarf novak djokov among crowd wit grip scrappi game new zealand scrumhalf aaron smith dive left corner earli second half tri rule unga made great break midfield dummi insid fullback damian willems fed smith dive yet anoth tmo decis rule tri knock buildup kolisi card upgrad came back moment later minut left play new zealand top brilliant improvis one hand loop pass jordi barrett found wing mark tele slip two tackl feed beauden barrett left corner gave new zealand hope end kolisi becam second skipper lead team back back world cup victori new zealand great richi mccaw
Google's trial comes as critical test for US regulators,"The Department of Justice is accusing the search engine of preserving its monopoly through exclusive contracts. But the supervision of Big Tech, Big Pharma and Big Oil is a delicate matter, with Washington also aiming for an industrial rearmament in the face of China.","A quarter of a century after trying to dismantle Microsoft, United States antitrust authorities are taking on Google. A trial begins in Washington DC on Tuesday, September 12, which could signal the culmination of an offensive against Big Tech launched under former US president Donald Trump and continued by his successor Joe Biden.Google handles around 90% of the world's search engine queries, and the Department of Justice is accusing it of maintaining a monopoly ""through exclusionary agreements with distributors"" that make Google the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser and Mozilla's Firefox. The same argument was used against Microsoft, which used exclusivity contracts to promote Internet Explorer and eliminate Netscape.Yet nobody believes a trial will change the game fundamentally. Investors keep buying shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company. Since the beginning of the year, Alphabet is up 50%. The judge presiding over the trial, Amit Mehta, dismissed lawsuits brought jointly by 38 states, Republican and Democrat, over Google's advertising practices and focused the case on the search engine alone. A series of setbacks suffered by the federal government, unable to convince judges to sanction Big Tech firms, also serves as a reminder that regulating Google will prove arduous.The authorities' stance toward Google is embodied by Lina Khan, chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, which shares with the DOJ the task of implementing Biden's antitrust approach. The 34-year-old made a name for herself in 2017 with an article explaining that just because Amazon kept prices low for consumers did not mean it was not abusing its position to the detriment of other sellers listed on its platform. Once appointed, she stepped up her antitrust attacks, accentuating the anti-tech backlash begun under Trump, a crusade that ended in emblematic failures. ""Are you losing on purpose?"" Kevin Riley, representative for California's 3rd congressional district, asked Khan in a congressional hearing in July.Khan lost her case against Microsoft, which she wanted to prevent from acquiring online gaming specialist Activision for $70 billion. A judge ruled that she had failed to prove that the takeover would reduce competition and harm consumers. The lesson here is that judges do not like to punish vertical integrations. Previously, under the Trump administration, antitrust authorities had been unable to block AT&T's takeover of Time Warner. However, this did not prevent the operation from turning into a disaster.",Pixels,quarter century trying dismantle microsoft united states antitrust authorities taking google trial begins washington tuesday september could signal culmination offensive big tech launched former president donald trump continued successor joe biden google handles around worlds search engine queries department justice accusing maintaining monopoly exclusionary agreements distributors make google default search engine apples safari browser mozillas firefox argument used microsoft used exclusivity contracts promote internet explorer eliminate netscape yet nobody believes trial change game fundamentally investors keep buying shares alphabet googles parent company since beginning year alphabet judge presiding trial amit mehta dismissed lawsuits brought jointly states republican democrat googles advertising practices focused case search engine alone series setbacks suffered federal government unable convince judges sanction big tech firms also serves reminder regulating google prove arduous authorities stance toward google embodied lina khan chairwoman federal trade commission shares doj task implementing bidens antitrust approach year old made name article explaining amazon kept prices low consumers mean abusing position detriment sellers listed platform appointed stepped antitrust attacks accentuating anti tech backlash begun trump crusade ended emblematic failures losing purpose kevin riley representative californias congressional district asked khan congressional hearing july khan lost case microsoft wanted prevent acquiring online gaming specialist activision billion judge ruled failed prove takeover would reduce competition harm consumers lesson judges like punish vertical integrations previously trump administration antitrust authorities unable block takeover time warner however prevent operation turning disaster,quarter centuri tri dismantl microsoft unit state antitrust author take googl trial begin washington tuesday septemb could signal culmin offens big tech launch former presid donald trump continu successor joe biden googl handl around world search engin queri depart justic accus maintain monopoli exclusionari agreement distributor make googl default search engin appl safari browser mozilla firefox argument use microsoft use exclus contract promot internet explor elimin netscap yet nobodi believ trial chang game fundament investor keep buy share alphabet googl parent compani sinc begin year alphabet judg presid trial amit mehta dismiss lawsuit brought jointli state republican democrat googl advertis practic focus case search engin alon seri setback suffer feder govern unabl convinc judg sanction big tech firm also serv remind regul googl prove arduou author stanc toward googl embodi lina khan chairwoman feder trade commiss share doj task implement biden antitrust approach year old made name articl explain amazon kept price low consum mean abus posit detriment seller list platform appoint step antitrust attack accentu anti tech backlash begun trump crusad end emblemat failur lose purpos kevin riley repres california congression district ask khan congression hear juli khan lost case microsoft want prevent acquir onlin game specialist activis billion judg rule fail prove takeov would reduc competit harm consum lesson judg like punish vertic integr previous trump administr antitrust author unabl block takeov time warner howev prevent oper turn disast
France orders Apple iPhone 12 sales halted over high radiation levels,    The French agency that regulates radio frequencies said Tuesday that testing found that the model emits more electromagnetic waves susceptible to be absorbed by the body than permitted. ,"French regulators on Tuesday, September 12, ordered Apple to halt sales of the iPhone 12 for emitting too much electromagnetic radiation, and to fix existing handsets. The French agency that regulates radio frequencies, the ANFR, said testing found that the model emits more electromagnetic waves susceptible to be absorbed by the body than permitted.The ANFR said it ""ordered Apple to remove the iPhone 12 from the French market from September 12 due to the model exceeding the limit"" for electromagnetic absorption by the body. It said accredited labs had found absorption of electromagnetic energy by the body at 5.74 watts per kilogram during tests simulating when the phone was being held in the hand or kept in a pocket.The European standard is a specific absorption rate of 4.0 watts per kilogram in such tests. ""Concerning phones already sold, Apple must in the briefest of delays take corrective measures to bring the affected phones into compliance,"" said the ANFR in a statement on its website. ""Otherwise, Apple will have to recall them.""ANFR noted that tests that measure the electromagnetic radiation absorbed at a distance of five centimetres was in compliance with the limit of 2.0 watts per kilogram. ANFR said its agents would verify beginning on Wednesday that iPhone 12 models were no longer being offered for sale in France.When contacted by Agence France-Presse (AFP), Apple disputed the ANFR's results, saying it had presented multiple independent analyses showing the devices were in compliance, but that the company would nonetheless continue to work with the regulator.Regulators in a number of countries have limits on the amount of electromagnetic radiation mobile phones may emit to prevent adverse health effects. The World Health Organization states on its website that following a large number of studies that ""no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use"".The news from France came the same day that Apple unveiled its new iPhone 15 lineup, the first to feature a universal charging port in place of its unique ""Lightning"" ports after a tussle with European regulators.The EU is insisting that all phones and other small devices must be compatible with the USB-C charging cables from the end of next year, a move it says will reduce waste and save money for consumers.""USB-C has become a universally accepted standard.

TikTok fined €345 million for violating children's privacy,"    The investigation, opened in 2021 by Ireland's privacy regulator, accuses the platform of two things, including making all newly created profiles public by default. ","The Data Protection Commission (DPC), Ireland's privacy regulator, announced in a press release on Friday, September 15, that it had imposed a €345 million penalty on TikTok. To date, this is the largest fine imposed in Europe against the Chinese social media platform.The DPC criticized TikTok for two things:The social media platform has three months to comply with the two issues, according to the institution.This record fine is the result of an investigation opened in September 2021 by the DPC and covering a period from July to December 2020. It has been the subject of much wrangling, with some other European data protection agencies challenging a preliminary decision by their Irish counterpart. The case was finally settled by the European Data Protection Committee, the umbrella body for the various European authorities, which forced the DPC to add an additional infringement.In France, TikTok was already fined €5 million in January for the way it handled cookies on its website. While the social media platform ""did indeed offer a button enabling immediate acceptance of cookies,"" it did not provide ""an equivalent solution (button or other) to enable the web user to refuse them as easily,"" explained the CNIL (Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés, France's privacy regulator) at the time in its deliberation.",Pixels,data protection commission dpc irelands privacy regulator announced press release friday september imposed million penalty tiktok date largest fine imposed europe chinese social media platform dpc criticized tiktok two things social media platform three months comply two issues according institution record fine result investigation opened september dpc covering period july december subject much wrangling european data protection agencies challenging preliminary decision irish counterpart case finally settled european data protection committee umbrella body various european authorities forced dpc add additional infringement france tiktok already fined million january way handled cookies website social media platform indeed offer button enabling immediate acceptance cookies provide equivalent solution button enable web user refuse easily explained cnil commission nationale linformatique des libert frances privacy regulator time deliberation,data protect commiss dpc ireland privaci regul announc press releas friday septemb impos million penalti tiktok date largest fine impos europ chines social media platform dpc critic tiktok two thing social media platform three month compli two issu accord institut record fine result investig open septemb dpc cover period juli decemb subject much wrangl european data protect agenc challeng preliminari decis irish counterpart case final settl european data protect committe umbrella bodi variou european author forc dpc add addit infring franc tiktok alreadi fine million januari way handl cooki websit social media platform inde offer button enabl immedi accept cooki provid equival solut button enabl web user refus easili explain cnil commiss national linformatiqu de libert franc privaci regul time deliber
France bans sale of iPhone 12: Here's what to know,"    According to the French National Frequencies Agency, the device generates radiation levels that exceed European standards. Apple has two weeks to come up with an update to solve the problem. ","In a press release published on Tuesday, September 12, the French National Frequencies Agency (ANFR) called on retailers and online stores to temporarily suspend sales of the iPhone 12. According to the agency, the Apple device generates radiation levels that exceed current European standardsLike other smartphones, this device can detect the immediate proximity of the human body thanks to its motion and proximity sensors. This allows it to reduce wave emissions and, theoretically, to pass ANFR tests seamlessly. However, according to the agency, this system is not entirely reliable: ""We have found that the iPhone 12 does not always detect the immediate presence of the body, said ANFR CEO Gilles Brégant when contacted on Wednesday by Le Monde. ""This is the root of the problem.""Apple told Agence France-Presse that it disputes the agency's conclusions. The manufacturer claims to have provided independent third-party laboratory studies proving that its devices comply with the standards. The brand nevertheless says it will continue its discussions with the authorities.""We have no evidence to suggest otherwise,"" said Brégant. ANFR, which regularly checks emissions from different smartphone models, sampled iPhone 12 devices in stores from November 2021 – just over a year after its release in October 2020 – before carrying out its tests a few months later.It found that the limit values for electromagnetic waves emitted and absorbed by the human body had been exceeded. Since then, the problem has not been corrected, and therefore it is likely that all iPhone 12s are affected, with the exception of iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 pro, for which tests have not revealed excessive radiation.As part of its study, ANFR commissioned two types of tests from the German laboratory Cetecom Advanced. The first test involves measuring wave absorption by the human torso. This scenario corresponds to carrying a cell phone in a bag or suit, i.e. at a distance of 5 millimeters from the body. These tests did not reveal that the thresholds authorized in Europe were exceeded.The second test, on the other hand, which measures absorption by the limbs (legs, arms, hands...), revealed values exceeding the set limits. This test measures, for example, wave emissions toward the hand holding the smartphone, or the thigh against which it is pressed when placed in a pocket. The specific absorption rate (SAR), expressed in watts per kilogram, came to 5.74 W/kg, while the maximum authorized threshold is 4 W/kg.Below this threshold, according to the French National Health and Safety Agency (ANSES), there are no adverse health effects. With a peak observed at 5.74, the risks remain minimal, according to Jean-Noël Barrot, minister for digital transition and telecommunications, who was quoted in the newspaper Le Parisien on Tuesday as saying that this 44% overshoot was ""very slight."" This risk is all the more limited keeping in mind that tests in the European Union, as ANSES pointed out, are carried out on phones that are pushed to their maximum power for the duration of the test, which does not correspond to their actual use.If Apple corrects this problem within a few weeks, the excess should have no noticeable effect on health. ""It's not a serious and immediate risk,"" said Brégant. But if the Apple brand refuses, the most cautious users may think about changing their cell phone. Given the impossibility, for the time being, of verifying the total absence of health effects, ANSES recommended using phones that emit lower radiation and reducing children's exposure.Issues with radiation exceeding the threshold can usually be resolved remotely by the manufacturer, with a simple software update. This operation is very easy for users, and most iPhone owners do this on a regular basis. In the case of iPhone 12, however, this update may be tricky to get right, since it is linked to its ability to automatically detect human proximity.According to Minister Barrot, the rules are the same for everyone, including Big Tech. ANFR, for its part, said that ""the tests are the same for everyone"" and that they ""are standardized and reproducible.""Manufacturers generally take breaches of emission limits seriously. Over the past three years, some 20 smartphones found in violation in France have received corrective updates, notably from Samsung, Motorola, Xiaomi and Sony. These corrections often are made in less than a year.With Apple, however, ""the exchanges dragged on for an unusually long time. For the moment, Apple has still not given us any indication of how it intends to solve the problem,"" said ANFR. Was it this situation that prompted the agency to publicly announce the halting of iPhone 12 distribution on Tuesday, right in the middle of Apple's conference announcing the iPhone 15? ""The timing is purely coincidental,"" said Brégant.If Apple fails to take action within the next two weeks, ANFR could go so far as to require the recall of all iPhone 12s on the French market. ""Consumers could then be compensated with a refund or voucher,"" ANFR explained. ""We have already done this for other brands in the past. But we are confident it will not come to that.""",Pixels,press release published tuesday september french national frequencies agency anfr called retailers online stores temporarily suspend sales

Apple to update iPhone 12 in France over radiation,    France had ordered a halt to sales of the device after regulators raised concerns over the amount of electromagnetic radiation emitted. ,"Apple said on Friday, September 15, that it would update the iPhone 12 in France after regulators raised concerns over electromagnetic radiation emitted by the devices.France had ordered a halt to sales of the device, released in 2020, on Tuesday after finding that the model emitted more electromagnetic waves than permitted.""Apple has assured me that it will implement an update for the iPhone 12 in the next few days,"" said France's minister for digital transition and telecommunications, Jean-Noel Barrot, in a statement to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Both the firm and Barrot insisted there was no danger to public health from the radiation.""This is related to a specific testing protocol used by French regulators and not a safety concern,"" Apple said in a statement, adding that the device complied with rules on emissions all around the world. ""We will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators.""The US tech giant had been given two weeks to issue an update to its phone, which was coming to the end of its career as a front-line Apple product. Barrot said the agency in charge of testing, the French National Frequencies Agency (ANFR), would quickly assess the update and decide whether to lift the ban on sales.The World Health Organization points out that several studies in the field have failed to find adverse health effects caused by mobile phone use. And there are no specific illnesses linked to such radiation. But exposure to more than 40 watts per kilogram (W/kg) of electromagnetic radiation does increase body temperature. European regulations allow only 4 W/kg for such devices and the iPhone 12 exceeded that level by 1.7 W/kg.Apple has endured an unusually tough week. Its launch of new products was overshadowed by an announcement that it was replacing its proprietary ""lightning"" charging ports with standard USB-C ports on the latest generation of iPhones, a measure demanded by EU regulators.And Chinese officials denied claims that they had banned iPhones in government buildings before taking a swipe at the firm.

"'Elon Musk,' a biography of the multibillionaire and his demons",Review,"The main revelation in the book Elon Musk, biography of the multi-billionaire boss of Tesla, Space X, and Twitter (turned X), was that the businessman allegedly unexpectedly blocked a major offensive by the Ukrainian army against the Russian fleet by cutting off access to his Starlink service, which Ukrainian drones use to connect to the internet. But even before the book's release on September 12 in the US and September 13 in the rest of the world, this scoop was being disputed by stakeholders. And Walter Isaacson, the biographer, was forced to specify that Starlink was not activated in Crimea at the time and that Elon Musk, rather than interrupting an attack that had already been launched, had simply refused to extend the service in the region for fear of escalating the conflict.This inaccuracy largely disrupted the launch of one of the most eagerly awaited non-fiction books of the year. Isaacson, best known for his previous 2011 biography of Steve Jobs, was able to follow Musk for almost two years, until the beginning of 2023, giving him a behind-the-scenes look at dozens of key moments in his subject's life: The twitter takeover, the Starship rocket explosion and the birth of several of his children. The multi-billionaire, who did not read the book before publication, also invited all those closest to him to speak at length with his biographer, giving him access to a gigantic quantity of anecdotes, personal recollections and stories that had never before been told, at least not at this level of detail.The whole thing makes for fascinating read, not so much for its ""great revelations"" – there are, after all, quite few of them – as for the color it brings to Musk's character. It's a resolutely dark hue: Tesla's founder comes across as a visionary and courageous engineer, but above all as a detestable human being.In 600 pages, Isaacson recounts the details of multiple tantrums, brutal dismissals of employees whose only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and humiliations inflicted on employees and members of his own family. In 2018, when the restaurant chain owned by his brother Kimbal, a historic business partner and one of his closest supporters, was in trouble, he initially refused a loan. ""I had my finance guy look at it, and the restaurants are struggling. I think they should die,"" he told his brother.This ""demon mode,"" described by his partner, the singer Grimes, as the moments ""when he goes dark and retreats inside the storm in his brain,"" is what Isaacson was looking for in both Musk's past and his psychology. There's his violent, manipulative father, with whom he undoubtedly shares more personality traits than he would like, his repeated beatings at school in South Africa and then there's his very different way of thinking, his taste for excessive risk-taking, his need to generate danger when things are too calm, his lack of empathy. Is it Asperger syndrome, as Musk himself claims? Bipolarity, as several members of his entourage believe? Musk, who happily sleeps under his desk when he's dealing with a crisis – which is very often – is not easily put on the couch.",Pixels,main revelation book elon musk biography multi billionaire boss tesla space twitter turned businessman allegedly unexpectedly blocked major offensive ukrainian army russian fleet cutting access starlink service ukrainian drones use connect internet even books release september september rest world scoop disputed stakeholders walter isaacson biographer forced specify starlink activated crimea time elon musk rather interrupting attack already launched simply refused extend service region fear escalating conflict inaccuracy largely disrupted launch one eagerly awaited non fiction books year isaacson best known previous biography steve jobs able follow musk almost two years beginning giving behind scenes look dozens key moments subjects life twitter takeover starship rocket explosion birth several children multi billionaire read book publication also invited closest speak length biographer giving access gigantic quantity anecdotes personal recollections stories never told least level detail whole thing makes fascinating read much great revelations quite color brings musks character resolutely dark hue teslas founder comes across visionary courageous engineer detestable human pages isaacson recounts details multiple tantrums brutal dismissals employees whose fault wrong place wrong time humiliations inflicted employees members family restaurant chain owned brother kimbal historic business partner one closest supporters trouble initially refused loan finance guy look restaurants struggling think die told brother demon mode described partner singer grimes moments goes dark retreats inside storm brain isaacson looking musks past psychology theres violent manipulative father undoubtedly shares personality traits would like repeated beatings school south africa theres different way thinking taste excessive risk taking need generate danger things calm lack empathy asperger syndrome musk claims bipolarity several members entourage believe musk happily sleeps desk hes dealing crisis often easily put couch,main revel book elon musk biographi multi billionair boss tesla space twitter turn businessman allegedli unexpectedli block major offens ukrainian armi russian fleet cut access starlink servic ukrainian drone use connect internet even book releas septemb septemb rest world scoop disput stakehold walter isaacson biograph forc specifi starlink activ crimea time elon musk rather interrupt attack alreadi launch simpli refus extend servic region fear escal conflict inaccuraci larg disrupt launch one eagerli await non fiction book year isaacson best known previou biographi steve job abl follow musk almost two year begin give behind scene look dozen key moment subject life twitter takeov starship rocket explos birth sever children multi billionair read book public also invit closest speak length biograph give access gigant quantiti anecdot person recollect stori never told least level detail whole thing make fascin read much great revel quit color bring musk charact resolut dark hue tesla founder come across visionari courag engin detest human page isaacson recount detail multipl tantrum brutal dismiss employe whose fault wrong place wrong time humili inflict employe member famili restaur chain own brother kimbal histor busi partner one closest support troubl initi refus loan financ guy look restaur struggl think die told brother demon mode describ partner singer grime moment goe dark retreat insid storm brain isaacson look musk past psycholog there violent manipul father undoubtedli share person trait would like repeat beat school south africa there differ way think tast excess risk take need gener danger thing calm lack empathi asperg syndrom musk claim bipolar sever member entourag believ musk happili sleep desk he deal crisi often easili put couch
French data protection chief: 'We believe in the growth of French and European AI operators',    The president of the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties talks to Le Monde about the implementation of GDPR in France and the question of AI. ,"When she took charge of the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties (CNIL) in 2019, Marie-Laure Denis's main task was to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). With her first term of office drawing to a close in February 2024, the president of the regulatory authority takes stock in an interview with Le Monde and looks back on a year that has seen the introduction of numerous legislative texts on digital matters, both at the national and European level.Marie-Laure Denis: The GDPR has streamlined national data protection regulations. It has increased sanctions to up to 4% of a company's global turnover. Decision-makers are now more concerned with the issue of using personal data, and individuals have become increasingly aware of how it is used. For example, the number of complaints we receive has doubled every year or so since the regulation was implemented. What's more, the GDPR has, to some extent, enabled the European model to be exported. There are now dozens of roughly identical legislations around the world.The €1.2 billion fine imposed by the European Union on Meta or, again very recently, the €345 million fine imposed on TikTok are evidence of the GDPR's ability to overcome these difficulties. It is now well established, meaning that there are now many sanctions that act as deterrents.Early 2019 saw the emergence of questions over artificial intelligence (AI), with the introduction of so-called ""augmented"" cameras and generative AI. These matters have become more significant and are now focusing much of the CNIL's energy. Companies are asking a lot of questions. And our aim, without waiting for the European regulation on artificial intelligence, which probably won't come into force before 2026, is to reconcile data protection with innovation, offering stakeholders support while providing legal certainty.We therefore launched an artificial intelligence plan last spring. Over the next few weeks, we will be publishing seven practical fact sheets detailing, for example, how to set up databases to train artificial intelligence systems. We will then publish other documents on generative AI and on the security issues specific to artificial intelligence systems. We are committed to providing this support because we believe in the growth of French and European AI operators.",Pixels,took charge national commission information technology civil liberties cnil marie laure deniss main task ensure compliance general data protection regulation gdpr first term office drawing close february president regulatory authority takes stock interview monde looks back year seen introduction numerous legislative texts digital matters national european level marie laure denis gdpr streamlined national data protection regulations increased sanctions companys global turnover decision makers concerned issue using personal data individuals become increasingly aware used example number complaints receive doubled every year since regulation implemented whats gdpr extent enabled european model exported dozens roughly identical legislations around world billion fine imposed european union meta recently million fine imposed tiktok evidence gdprs ability overcome difficulties well established meaning many sanctions act deterrents early saw emergence questions artificial intelligence introduction called augmented cameras generative matters become significant focusing much cnils energy companies asking lot questions aim without waiting european regulation artificial intelligence probably wont come force reconcile data protection innovation offering stakeholders support providing legal certainty therefore launched artificial intelligence plan last spring next weeks publishing seven practical fact sheets detailing example set databases train artificial intelligence systems publish documents generative security issues specific artificial intelligence systems committed providing support believe growth french european operators,took charg nation commiss inform technolog civil liberti cnil mari laur deniss main task ensur complianc gener data protect regul gdpr first term offic draw close februari presid regulatori author take stock interview mond look back year seen introduct numer legisl text digit matter nation european level mari laur deni gdpr streamlin nation data protect regul increas sanction compani global turnov decis maker concern issu use person data individu becom increasingli awar use exampl number complaint receiv doubl everi year sinc regul implement what gdpr extent enabl european model export dozen roughli ident legisl around world billion fine impos european union meta recent million fine impos tiktok evid gdpr abil overcom difficulti well establish mean mani sanction act deterr earli saw emerg question artifici intellig introduct call augment camera gener matter becom signific focus much cnil energi compani ask lot question aim without wait european regul artifici intellig probabl wont come forc reconcil data protect innov offer stakehold support provid legal certainti therefor launch artifici intellig plan last spring next week publish seven practic fact sheet detail exampl set databas train artifici intellig system publish document gener secur issu specif artifici intellig system commit provid support believ growth french european oper
Hollywood writers' strike officially over; Actors vote for walkout against video game makers,"    The five-month writer's strike has ended after unions and studios approved a deal, which members will vote on from October 2 to 9. Striking actors, meanwhile, remain on walkout and have voted to expand their strike to video games. ","Leaders of the screenwriters union declared their nearly five-month-old strike over Tuesday, September 26, after board members approved a contract agreement with studios, bringing Hollywood at least partly back from a historic halt in production. The governing boards of the eastern and western branches of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and their joint negotiating committee all voted to accept the deal, and afterward declared that the strike would be over and writers would be free to work starting at 12:01 am local time on Wednesday, September 27.Late-night talk shows – the first to go dark when writers walked out on May 2 – are likely the first shows that will resume. The writers still have to vote to ratify the contract themselves, but lifting the strike will allow them to work during that process, the Writers Guild told members in an email.After Tuesday's board votes, the contracts were released to the writers, who had not yet been given any details on the deal, which their leaders called ""exceptional."" The members will vote between October 2 and 9.Hollywood actors, however, remain on strike with no talks yet on the horizon, but a new spirit of optimism motivated those who were picketing on Tuesday, September 26, for the first time since writers reached their tentative deal on the night of Sunday, September 24. ""For a hot second, I really thought that this was going to go on until next year,"" said Marissa Cuevas, an actor who has appeared on the TV series Kung Fu and The Big Bang Theory. ""Knowing that at least one of us has gotten a good deal gives a lot of hope that we will also get a good deal.""Writers' picket lines had been suspended, but they were encouraged to walk in solidarity with actors, and many were beside them on Tuesday, September 26, including Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner, who picketed alongside friend and ER actor Noah Wyle as he has throughout the strikes. ""We would never have had the leverage we had if SAG had not gone out,"" Weiner said. ""They were very brave to do it.""Striking actors also voted to authorize their leadership to potentially expand their walkout to include the lucrative video game market, a step that could put new pressure on Hollywood studios to make a deal with the performers who provide voices and stunts for games.The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Radio and Television Artists (SAG-AFTRA) announced the move late on Monday, September 25, saying that 98% of its members voted to go on strike against video game companies if ongoing negotiations are not successful. The announcement came ahead of more talks planned for Tuesday, September 26.Acting in video games can include a variety of roles, from voice performances to motion capture work as well as stunts. Video game actors went on strike in 2016 in a work stoppage that lasted nearly a year.Some of the issues at stake in the video game negotiations are the same as in the broader actors strike that has shut down Hollywood for months, including wages, safety measures and protections on the use of artificial intelligence. The companies involved include gaming giants Activision, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Take 2 Productions as well as Warner Bros. and Disney's video game divisions.""It's time for the video game companies to stop playing games and get serious about reaching an agreement on this contract,"" SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in a statement.Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for video game producers, said they are ""continuing to negotiate in good faith"" and have reached tentative agreements on more than half of the proposals on the table. So far this year, US consumers have spent $34.9 billion on video games, consoles and accessories, according to market research group Circana.The threat of a video game strike emerged as Hollywood writers were on the verge of getting back to work after months on the picket lines. The alliance of studios, streaming services and producers has chosen to negotiate only with the writers so far and has made no overtures yet toward restarting talks with SAG-AFTRA. That will presumably change soon. SAG-AFTRA leaders have said they will look closely at the writers' agreement, which includes many of the same issues, but it will not affect their demands.",Pixels,leaders screenwriters union declared

New French report warns that 'serious violations of human dignity' in porn is commonplace,"    Online pornography is abundantly filled with shocking and degrading scenes that could be punishable by law, according to a new report. The council behind the report wants the porn industry to be sanctioned. ","Sylvie Pierre-Brossolette thought it was crucial to cause a shock, to "" break through the wall of indifference"" surrounding the porn industry's sordid reality. Pierre-Brossolette is the president of the French High Council for Equality between Women and Men (HCE). Her report ""Porno-criminality: Putting an end to the porn industry's impunity,"" has achieved that goal. The report, which is due to be officially handed over to Bérangère Couillard, the French minister for gender equality, on Wednesday September 27, paints a terrifying picture.For over a year, the HCE's violence against women commission has been examining videos available to watch online. It organized a large number of hearings, reviewed existing literature and, in March, carried out a study of four pornography platforms (PornHub, Xhamster, Xvideos and Xnxx). More than 230 pages documented those investigations, accompanied by a warning from the HCE, which intends to ""draw attention to the serious violations of human dignity and the serious consequences of the unlimited and illegal distribution of this sexual content.""The videos display physical violence, verbal aggression and, in many cases, acts of torture and barbarism. The vast majority of the content on offer is packed with images that are not only shocking and degrading for women but are also liable to criminal sanctions under French law, explained the HCE.The advisory body, tasked with guiding government policy on equality issues, endorsed comments made by Laure Beccuau, the Paris public prosecutor. At a senate hearing in September 2022 on the first parliamentary report on the topic entitled ""Behind the Scenes"" (""L'envers du décor""), the judge said that ""90% of pornographic content contains physical or verbal violence, and is therefore criminally reprehensible.""""Our report is intended to be an in-depth examination and extension of the Senate report,"" said Pierre-Brossolette.A search on four sites distributing such content in France showed 70,118 videos under the keyword ""surprise"" and 13,898 under ""torture."" There were at least 1.4 million videos containing sadistic practices, including ""women tortured by electrocution, women asphyxiated in plastic bags, women screaming in pain."" What's happening in these videos, which can be accessed in just a few clicks, is not simulated. It is a "" horrifying reality: A significant proportion of pornographic videos distributed are videos of filmed rapes, revenge porn, or have been obtained through coercion in sexual exploitation rings,"" the researchers reported. ""Their suffering is perfectly visible and eroticized at the same time.""",Pixels,sylvie pierre brossolette thought crucial cause shock break wall indifference surrounding porn industrys sordid reality pierre brossolette president french high council equality women men hce report porno criminality putting end porn industrys impunity achieved goal report due officially handed rang couillard french minister gender equality wednesday september paints terrifying year hces violence women commission examining videos available watch online organized large number hearings reviewed existing literature march carried study four pornography platforms pornhub xhamster xvideos xnxx pages documented investigations accompanied warning hce intends draw attention serious violations human dignity serious consequences unlimited illegal distribution sexual content videos display physical violence verbal aggression many cases acts torture barbarism vast majority content offer packed images shocking degrading women also liable criminal sanctions french law explained hce advisory body tasked guiding government policy equality issues endorsed comments made laure beccuau paris public prosecutor senate hearing september first parliamentary report behind scenes lenvers cor judge said pornographic content contains physical verbal violence therefore criminally reprehensible report intended depth examination extension senate report said pierre brossolette search four sites distributing content france showed videos keyword surprise torture least million videos containing sadistic practices including women tortured electrocution women asphyxiated plastic bags women screaming pain whats happening videos accessed clicks simulated horrifying reality significant proportion pornographic videos distributed videos filmed rapes revenge porn obtained coercion sexual exploitation rings researchers reported suffering perfectly visible eroticized time,sylvi pierr brossolett thought crucial caus shock break wall indiffer surround porn industri sordid realiti pierr brossolett presid french high council equal women men hce report porno crimin put end porn industri impun achiev goal report due offici hand rang couillard french minist gender equal wednesday septemb paint terrifi year hce violenc women commiss examin video avail watch onlin organ larg number hear review exist literatur march carri studi four pornographi platform pornhub xhamster xvideo xnxx page document investig accompani warn hce intend draw attent seriou violat human digniti seriou consequ unlimit illeg distribut sexual content video display physic violenc verbal aggress mani case act tortur barbar vast major content offer pack imag shock degrad women also liabl crimin sanction french law explain hce advisori bodi task guid govern polici equal issu endors comment made laur beccuau pari public prosecutor senat hear septemb first parliamentari report behind scene lenver cor judg said pornograph content contain physic verbal violenc therefor crimin reprehens report intend depth examin extens senat report said pierr brossolett search four site distribut content franc show video keyword surpris tortur least million video contain sadist practic includ women tortur electrocut women asphyxi plastic bag women scream pain what happen video access click simul horrifi realiti signific proport pornograph video distribut video film rape reveng porn obtain coercion sexual exploit ring research report suffer perfectli visibl erotic time
Meta unveils AI integration in smart glasses and digital assistants,"    Meta has previously been slower than its peers to push out AI products, and is now introducing AI characters based on celebrities including Snoop Dogg and Paris Hilton. ","Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday, September 27, said the tech giant is putting artificial intelligence into digital assistants and smart glasses as it seeks to gain lost ground in the AI race. Zuckerberg made his announcements at the Connect developers conference at Meta's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the company's main annual product event.""Advances in AI allow us to create different (applications) and personas that help us accomplish different things,"" Zuckerberg said as he kicked off the gathering. ""And smart glasses are going to eventually allow us to bring all of this together into a stylish form factor that we can wear.""Smart glasses are one of the many ways that tech companies have tried to move beyond the smartphone as a user-friendly device, but so far with little success. The second-generation Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses made in a partnership with EssilorLuxottica will have a starting price of $299 when they hit the market on October 17.The smart glasses also add the ability for users to stream what they are seeing in real-time, Zuckerberg said. ""Smart glasses are the ideal form factor for you to let AI assistants see what you're seeing and hear what you're hearing.""Meta also introduced 28 AI characters that people can message on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram with ""personalities"" based on celebrities including Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton and YouTube star MrBeast. Zuckerberg demonstrated an interaction with one such AI from the stage in a type-written chat promising that the new bots would soon be voiced.""This is our first effort at training a bunch of AI that are a bit more fun,"" Zuckerberg said. ""But look, this is early stuff and these still have a lot of limitations, which you will see when you use them.""The event was the first in-person edition of Connect since 2019, before the pandemic, and announcements on generative AI were widely expected. Meta has taken a much more cautious approach than its rivals Microsoft, OpenAI and Google to push out AI products, prioritizing small steps and making its in-house models available to developers and researchers.Meta also unveiled the latest version of its Quest virtual reality headset with richer graphics, improved audio, and the ability for a wearer to see what is around them without taking the gear off, a demonstration for AFP showed. ""This is going to be a big game changer and a big capacity improvement for these headsets,"" Zuckerberg told developers gathered in a Meta headquarters courtyard.Quest 3 headsets were priced starting at $499 and will begin shipping on October 10, according to Meta. This is substantially cheaper than Apple's Vision Pro, which will cost a hefty $3,499 when it is available early next year in the United States only. The Quest 3 ""is going to be the best value on the market for a long time to come"", said Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth, to laughter from the audience.New game titles for Quest 3 included ""Assassin's Creed Nexus"" from Ubisoft as well as a Roblox game. ""Meta is trying to bring a much-upgraded version of (mixed-reality) to the masses,"" said Insider Intelligence principal analyst Yory Wurmser.Meta chief product officer Chris Cox joked to journalists that his sister complains that she often winds up punching furniture when using virtual reality, and that problem goes away when gear instead digitally augments the real world around a person. ""We think that mixed reality is a really big step from virtual reality, which is basically a fully occluded thing,"" Cox said.

'Counter-Strike 2': The veteran shooter fires a new round,Long Read,"Like a sniper, Counter-Strike 2 (or CS2) likes to take players by surprise. The multiplayer shooter video game had only a vague release date, summer 2023, when it was revealed in March by its US creator Valve. Finally released on Wednesday, September 27, it's sure to be one of the most acclaimed titles of the year despite the publisher not rolling out any real promotional campaigns.For this, it can count on the vast community of fans of Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO), released in August 2012, of which CS2 is a free update. The previous installment in the series is the most-played video game on Steam, the leading platform for digital PC games, which is also owned by Valve; a record 1.8 million players were simultaneously connected to it in May. This fervor is also fueled by its competitions, which are among the biggest e-sport events on the planet: On May 21, over 12,000 people attended the final of the Major, Counter-Strike's biggest annual tournament, in the Parisian Accor Arena.Dreamed up by Vietnamese-Canadian programmer Minh Le during his studies in 1999, Counter-Strike is a veteran of the video game industry. At the time, the 22-year-old created video games by modifying existing titles – a practice known as modding. The idea for Counter-Strike was born while he was tinkering with Valve's hugely popular Half-Life (1998), whose realistic graphics he appreciated. He teamed up with US video game designer Jeff Cliffe, and the duo perfected the first version of the ""mod"" in just two months.The concept is based on two opposing teams: Terrorists versus the forces of law and order. A team wins a round when it eliminates all opposing players or achieves its objective – the most popular scenario is to plant (or successfully defuse) a bomb.Within a few months, Counter-Strike had won over FPS (""First Person Shooter"") fans, who were often discovering the joys of multiplayer games thanks to the first broadband connections, cybercafés and local network competitions, ""LAN-parties"" (local area network parties). By March 2000, it was steadily establishing itself as the most-played shooting game online, observed the British site Eurogamer at the time. ""It's flattering, but at the same time we know that it can dissipate at any time,"" said Le.This success did not escape the creators of Half-Life. In early 2000, Valve bought the intellectual property of Counter-Strike from the two ""modders"" and hired them to develop an official version, released in November 2000, called Half-Life: Counter-Strike. The game reached a wider audience and was well-received by critics.Then-rivals Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament were no match for Counter-Strike's strategic depth. The most precise players with the best reflexes are not guaranteed victory: Before the game, each team must first manage its finances to buy weapons and equipment, and team coordination and knowledge of the levels are essential to win.The excitement surrounding the game soon led to the creation of teams and leagues in which players could compete. In December 2001, the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL), the first professional e-sports competition circuit, organized an international Counter-Strike tournament in Dallas. It is regarded as the forerunner of the Majors, now managed by Valve.Its tactical and intense games provide a spectacle rich in twists and turns. The attendance of the public – mostly male, as professional player Stephanie Harvey, aka ""missharvey"" reminded Le Monde – is consolidated by the virality of YouTube videos from 2005, then Twitch live game broadcasts, after its launch in 2011. Eventually, tournaments became more professional, attracting the attention of new investors, sponsors, mainstream media and even politicians. During the Paris Major, two ministers were in the stands.But scammers and cheats are also part of the game. Match-fixing scandals have rocked the professional circuit and, in 2021, the e-sport integrity commission banned three players from competitions for match-fixing. The dice can also be loaded in the amateur sphere, such as with hacks that allow you to aim automatically, see through walls or go faster. Since the game's inception, developers have had to constantly adapt to the new tricks of cheaters.However, these excesses have never seriously threatened the future of Counter-Strike. For the franchise, the most difficult equation to solve lies elsewhere: How to modernize without upsetting the gaming experience? Any radical change would call into question hours or years of player training. ""You can't instantly bring a new game online without risking the integrity of the sport,"" Shaun Clark, head of Counter-Strike at the Electronic Sports League (ESL), said in June about CS2.That's why Valve insisted on a visual facelift, with less dull colors, new lighting, more detailed textures and better smoke modeling. Iconic game maps like ""Dust II"" and ""Mirage"" have been embellished but not changed; altering their layout would be as disruptive to a player as moving the lines or dimensions of a football field before a new season.This concern for fidelity has ensured the series' longevity, but it also makes it inflexible. It's hard for it to adapt to the innovations of its rivals, such as PUBG: Battleground (2017) and its addictive ""battle royale"" principle, in which 100 players battle it out on an island, or the dynamism of Valorant (2020), which is more accessible to younger players. In 2019, Le confessed to having curbed his creativity for fear of ""offending the community."" He left Valve in 2006 to pursue new projects.CS: GO nevertheless underwent a major transformation in 2013, with the introduction of skins. With no impact on the way the game is played, these virtual cosmetic objects – weapons or equipment of various appearances – can be bought or resold with real money. In addition to trigger-happy gamers, the venerable shooter now attracts collectors and speculators; some items trade at a premium, such as the rarest edition of the AWP Dragon Lore rifle (over $400,000), or the so-called ""Blue Gem"" version of the Karambit knife ($1.5 million). This expensive equipment will of course be automatically switched over from CS: GO to CS2: The sniper's mission is not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.",Pixels,like sniper counter strike

Tech giants race to unleash conversational AI assistants,"    Recent announcements from Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon highlight their investment in AI to usher in a new generation of virtual assistants, but questions are being raised regarding the practicality and ethical implications of these new services. ","If an Instagram or WhatsApp user could ask an ""assistant"" a question at any time, they might ask it to suggest nearby restaurants, have it perform a web search to ""settle a controversy between friends,"" or even ask it to create an image of an ocean liner equipped with sails to see what such a ship would look like. This was the vision presented by Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday, September 27. The Meta founder announced the rollout of 28 conversational bots across the Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger platforms. One of the tools will serve as a generalist, while the rest will focus on specific themes like cooking, combat sports, fashion, and more. Each thematic tool will feature an avatar representing a personality, such as rapper Snoop Dogg or fashion influencer Paris Hilton.""Launched in beta version in the US, the conversational robots are set to undergo continued development following their initial roll-out on social media. In the coming months, Meta intends to enable developers, brands and influencers to create their own versions.Zuckerberg's enthusiastic presentation was the latest in a series of announcements made over a few days by the tech giants in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Since the successful launch of the ChatGPT conversational robot in late 2022, its creator OpenAI, its partner Microsoft and their rivals Google, Meta and Amazon have entered an AI race that has resulted in a flurry of launches.The virtual personal assistant idea is the common thread of the announcements. AI has revived the tech industry's old dream of a universal companion to help users in their daily lives, leisure and work. The concept recalls early voice assistants such as Apple's Siri, Google Assistant or Alexa, created in 2014 by Amazon with inspiration from the omniscient Star Trek computer. The new conversational assistants are ""21st century Clippy"" explained Mor Naaman, a Cornell Tech professor specializing in human-AI communication in a press release, in a reference to the paper clip with human features launched by Microsoft in its Office suite in 1996 that was deactivated in 2001 following a barrage of mockery.On Tuesday, September 26, Microsoft launched another ""everyday companion"" in Windows 11, the latest version of its operating system. Available for the moment in North America, Asia and South America, the assistant, called Copilot, uses intelligence from Microsoft's partner OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.

AI's dizzying capability to dub one voice into a foreign language,    Tools from the startup HeyGen and the Internet giant Google use artificial intelligence to translate videos by cloning and synchronizing the speaker's voice. ,"It's a video of an internet user filming himself speaking in English on his mobile phone. Then we see the same clip again, but the person is now speaking in French, with no change in the tone of voice or lip movement. Then the video starts again, this time in German. This short demo, posted on September 11 by @mrjonfinger on X (formerly Twitter), illustrates the impressive and disturbing effect of new tools that are capable, thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), of generating an automatic dubbing, while cloning the speaker's voice and synchronizing their diction. Already viewed over 7 million times, this video uses software created by an American startup, HeyGen. But other companies, including Google, have similar applications. This latest breakthrough in AI increases questions about the future of translation and dubbing.On the internet, several impressed or amused people have tried out HeyGen's tool. Digital consultant Michel Levy Provençal tested this ""revolutionary new function for automatic video translation"" in Spanish, Polish, Hindi, etc. Others have dubbed a Jacques Brel song, a Lionel Messi press conference and a Charles de Gaulle speech.The HeyGen website allows users to try out the tool free of charge for around two minutes of video, but they have to pass through a queue which, on Thursday, September 14, had over 100,000 files. The startup also offers paid subscriptions (e.g. $48 (€45) a month for around 30 minutes of video).These synthetic dubbing tools are impressive, combining several AI techniques already on the market. They combine transcription from sound to text (Trint, DeepL or YouTube, which generates automatic subtitles on its videos), translation (DeepL, ChatGPT, Google Translate, etc.); text-to-speech synthesis; and the cloning of a voice from a recording. Voice cloning from a recording will soon be offered by Apple with its Personal Voice tool, which targets people prone to voice loss or illness.Software such as HeyGen raises the specter of breathtaking AI developments in translation. Tomorrow, will we be able to hear any foreign speaker translated live through our smartphone's headphones? Will we be able to watch any video or film dubbed into any language?Such a prospect raises questions and concerns. There are, of course, questions about translation quality and accents (the French in the X video sounds a little Québécois). In May, Google demonstrated a similar tool, Universal Translator, but opted to let ""trusted"" testers try it out before making it available to the general public. ""Some of these technologies could be used by the wrong people or organizations, for example to create deepfakes [deceptive realistic videos generated by AI],"" the company explained. Google added that it was working on tagging systems to recognize AI-created content, in order to combat misinformation.",Pixels,video internet user filming speaking english mobile phone see clip person speaking french change tone voice lip movement video starts time german short demo posted september formerly twitter illustrates impressive disturbing effect new tools capable thanks artificial intelligence generating automatic dubbing cloning speakers voice synchronizing diction already viewed million times video uses software created american startup heygen companies including google similar applications latest breakthrough increases questions future translation dubbing internet several impressed amused people tried heygens tool digital consultant michel levy proven tested revolutionary new function automatic video translation spanish polish hindi etc others dubbed jacques brel song lionel messi press conference charles gaulle speech heygen website allows users try tool free charge around two minutes video pass queue thursday september files startup also offers paid subscriptions month around minutes video synthetic dubbing tools impressive combining several techniques already market combine transcription sound text trint deepl youtube generates automatic subtitles videos translation deepl chatgpt google translate etc text speech synthesis cloning voice recording voice cloning recording soon offered apple personal voice tool targets people prone voice loss illness software heygen raises specter breathtaking developments translation tomorrow able hear foreign speaker translated live smartphones headphones able watch video film dubbed language prospect raises questions concerns course questions translation quality accents french video sounds little cois may google demonstrated similar tool universal translator opted let trusted testers try making available general public technologies could used wrong people organizations example create deepfakes deceptive realistic videos generated company explained google added working tagging systems recognize created content order combat misinformation,video internet user film speak english mobil phone see clip person speak french chang tone voic lip movement video start time german short demo post septemb formerli twitter illustr impress disturb effect new tool capabl thank artifici intellig gener automat dub clone speaker voic synchron diction alreadi view million time video use softwar creat american startup heygen compani includ googl similar applic latest breakthrough increas question futur translat dub internet sever impress amus peopl tri heygen tool digit consult michel levi proven test revolutionari new function automat video translat spanish polish hindi etc other dub jacqu brel song lionel messi press confer charl gaull speech heygen websit allow user tri tool free charg around two minut video pass queue thursday septemb file startup also offer paid subscript month around minut video synthet dub tool impress combin sever techniqu alreadi market combin transcript sound text trint deepl youtub gener automat subtitl video translat deepl chatgpt googl translat etc text speech synthesi clone voic record voic clone record soon offer appl person voic tool target peopl prone voic loss ill softwar heygen rais specter breathtak develop translat tomorrow abl hear foreign speaker translat live smartphon headphon abl watch video film dub languag prospect rais question concern cours question translat qualiti accent french video sound littl coi may googl demonstr similar tool univers translat opt let trust tester tri make avail gener public technolog could use wrong peopl organ exampl creat deepfak decept realist video gener compani explain googl ad work tag system recogn creat content order combat misinform
Macron's camp keen on presenting AI as an opportunity,"    The French president's loyal followers are insisting on the potential artificial intelligence represents for France, using it as a dividing issue with the far right. ","Philippe Aghion is very familiar with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the moment when the HAL 9000 computer takes control of the spaceship. But the economist has little interest in science fiction. Since September 19, he has been co-chairing the committee of experts on artificial intelligence (AI), launched by French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, whose mission is to present ""concrete proposals"" for adapting France's ""national strategy"" within the next six months. While the inter-ministerial committee is tasked with exploring the potential effects of this new technology, as fascinating as it is frightening, on employment, inequality and happiness at work, the Collège de France professor is approaching his subject with ""Churchillian optimism,"" he said.Aware of the dangers of AI, the former Harvard professor imagines, in six months, showing above all the extent of the benefits of this technology and reducing its anxiety-provoking potential. ""You're less afraid of something when you know more about it,"" he told Le Monde, assuring that he hadn't heard Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right Rassemblement national (RN) party, speak on the subject in the spring.The 28-year-old's keen interest in AI, which he describes as ""the most dizzying challenge of our century,"" has nonetheless baffled the government. ""In the knowledge economy, mankind is going to have the power of the gods in his hands: to colonize the cosmos, to carry out embryonic selection, to regulate genetics. France must regulate and innovate,"" pleaded Marine Le Pen's protégé on French television on April 2.Until now, French President Emmanuel Macron's supporters were alone, or almost alone, in taking political hold of this subject. Back in 2017, Macron, champion of the ""start-up nation,"" commissioned mathematician Cédric Villani to produce a report on this technology likely to provoke a shock comparable to the invention of the printing press or the Internet. At the time, France, like Europe, had been left behind by the digital giants. It is non-existent in the world of social media, and absent from the smartphone and search engine markets. The country had to get behind the Californian geeks and the Chinese brains to quickly bring out champions of artificial intelligence on French soil, with a great deal of public money: €1.5 billion was put on the table.Six years later, the arrival of ChatGPT, software capable of sustaining a lightning-fast online conversation, propelled AI into the public arena, carrying with it its share of theories about machines overtaking man. The call for a ""pause"" in AI development, signed in March by billionaire Elon Musk and hundreds of experts, underlining ""major risks for humanity,"" has only fueled these fears.",Pixels,philippe aghion familiar stanley kubricks space odyssey moment hal computer takes control spaceship economist little interest science fiction since september chairing committee experts artificial intelligence launched french prime minister elisabeth borne whose mission present concrete proposals adapting frances national strategy within next six months inter ministerial committee tasked exploring potential effects new technology fascinating frightening employment inequality happiness work coll france professor approaching subject churchillian optimism said aware dangers former harvard professor imagines six months showing extent benefits technology reducing anxiety provoking potential youre less afraid something know told monde assuring hadnt heard jordan bardella president far right rassemblement national party speak subject spring year olds keen interest describes dizzying challenge century nonetheless baffled government knowledge economy mankind going power gods hands colonize cosmos carry embryonic selection regulate genetics france must regulate innovate pleaded marine pens prot french television april french president emmanuel macrons supporters alone almost alone taking political hold subject back macron champion start nation commissioned mathematician dric villani produce report technology likely provoke shock comparable invention printing press internet time france like europe left behind digital giants non existent world social media absent smartphone search engine markets country get behind californian geeks chinese brains quickly bring champions artificial intelligence french soil great deal public money billion put table six years later arrival chatgpt software capable sustaining lightning fast online conversation propelled public arena carrying share theories machines overtaking man call pause development signed march billionaire elon musk hundreds experts underlining major risks humanity fueled fears,philipp aghion familiar stanley kubrick space odyssey moment hal comput take control spaceship economist littl interest scienc fiction sinc septemb chair committe expert artifici intellig launch french prime minist elisabeth born whose mission present concret propos adapt franc nation strategi within next six month inter ministeri committe task explor potenti effect new technolog fascin frighten employ inequ happi work coll franc professor approach subject churchillian optim said awar danger former harvard professor imagin six month show extent benefit technolog reduc anxieti provok potenti your less afraid someth know told mond assur hadnt heard jordan bardella presid far right rassembl nation parti speak subject spring year old keen interest describ dizzi challeng centuri nonetheless baffl govern knowledg economi mankind go power god hand colon cosmo carri embryon select regul genet franc must regul innov plead marin pen prot french televis april french presid emmanuel macron support alon almost alon take polit hold subject back macron champion start nation commiss mathematician dric villani produc report technolog like provok shock compar invent print press internet time franc like europ left behind digit giant non exist world social media absent smartphon search engin market countri get behind californian geek chines brain quickli bring champion artifici intellig french soil great deal public money billion put tabl six year later arriv chatgpt softwar capabl sustain lightn fast onlin convers propel public arena carri share theori machin overtak man call paus develop sign march billionair elon musk hundr expert underlin major risk human fuel fear
PlayStation: The head of Sony's video game division is stepping down,"    Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced the forthcoming departure of its CEO, Jim Ryan, who spearheaded the launch of the PlayStation 5. ","Jim Ryan, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), Sony's video game division, will step down in March 2024, the company announced in a statement on Wednesday, September 27. ""Jim Ryan has made the decision to retire in March 2024 after nearly 30 years with PlayStation,"" Sony said.""I have relished the opportunity to have a job I love in such a special company (...). But I'm finding it increasingly difficult to reconcile my life in Europe with my work in North America,"" said Ryan on September 27. The Japanese multinational's video game subsidiary is based in San Mateo, California.The 63-year-old Briton, who grew up in the suburbs of Newcastle, joined SIE in 1994, the year the first PlayStation was launched in Japan. He went on to head up the company's European branch and held a number of senior positions, including SIE's sales and marketing director, before being appointed president and CEO in 2019. Hiroki Totoki, Sony's chief operating and financial officer, will act as interim CEO from April 1, 2024, pending the appointment of a new CEO.In November 2020, Jim Ryan was at the helm of the launch of Sony's latest console, the PlayStation 5, in a period marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its release was notably disrupted by component shortages and a reduced number of consoles in store. It has since sold over 40 million units, according to the manufacturer.Ryan was also at the forefront of Sony's fight to prevent Microsoft's $69 billion takeover of publisher Activision Blizzard (Call of Duty, Diablo 4, Candy Crush). On several occasions, it has claimed that this takeover would enable its competitor, the Xbox console maker, to offer exclusivity for the hugely successful Call of Duty shooter series. Last July, while the takeover was under scrutiny by US and British competition authorities, Microsoft and SIE signed an agreement to ensure that the license would continue to be released on PlayStation.Under Ryan's presidency, SIE also worked on the buyouts of several studios, including Bungie (the American creators of Halo and Destiny) for $3.6 billion, or the Finnish Housemarque (creators of Returnal).",Pixels,jim ryan ceo sony interactive entertainment sie sonys video game division step march company announced statement wednesday september jim ryan made decision retire march nearly years playstation sony said relished opportunity job love special company finding increasingly difficult reconcile life europe work north america said ryan september japanese multinationals video game subsidiary based san mateo california year old briton grew suburbs newcastle joined sie year first playstation launched japan went head companys european branch held number senior positions including sies sales marketing director appointed president ceo hiroki totoki sonys chief operating financial officer act interim ceo april pending appointment new ceo november jim ryan helm launch sonys latest console playstation period marked covid pandemic release notably disrupted component shortages reduced number consoles store since sold million units according manufacturer ryan also forefront sonys fight prevent microsofts billion takeover publisher activision blizzard call duty diablo candy crush several occasions claimed takeover would enable competitor xbox console maker offer exclusivity hugely successful call duty shooter series last july takeover scrutiny british competition authorities microsoft sie signed agreement ensure license would continue released playstation ryans presidency sie also worked buyouts several studios including bungie american creators halo destiny billion finnish housemarque creators returnal,jim ryan ceo soni interact entertain sie soni video game divis step march compani announc statement wednesday septemb jim ryan made decis retir march nearli year playstat soni said relish opportun job love special compani find increasingli difficult reconcil life europ work north america said ryan septemb japanes multin video game subsidiari base san mateo california year old briton grew suburb newcastl join sie year first playstat launch japan went head compani european branch held number senior posit includ sie sale market director appoint presid ceo hiroki totoki soni chief oper financi offic act interim ceo april pend appoint new ceo novemb jim ryan helm launch soni latest consol playstat period mark covid pandem releas notabl disrupt compon shortag reduc number consol store sinc sold million unit accord manufactur ryan also forefront soni fight prevent microsoft billion takeov publish activis blizzard call duti diablo candi crush sever occas claim takeov would enabl competitor xbox consol maker offer exclus huge success call duti shooter seri last juli takeov scrutini british competit author microsoft sie sign agreement ensur licens would continu releas playstat ryan presid sie also work buyout sever studio includ bungi american creator halo destini billion finnish housemarqu creator return
"The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the 'Mozart of crypto,' and the bankruptcy of FTX","    Charged with fraud and money laundering, Bankman-Fried faces more than 100 years in prison. His trial is set to begin on Tuesday. ","His fortune had been estimated at $26 billion. He would strut around in shorts and a T-shirt with disheveled hair at conferences and generously provide funding to political officials, primarily Democrats. He recruited celebrities to promote his venture, such as Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen and her then-husband, NFL star Tom Brady. This was during the Bitcoin frenzy of 2021 and 2022.But on October 3, 31-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried, aka SBF, will be taken from his prison cell to appear at the first day of his trial in Manhattan, and the ""Mozart of crypto"" has nothing left. The son of professors from Stanford University's Law School in California, he himself studied mathematics and physics at the prestigious MIT. He has now been abandoned by his main associates as well as his former girlfriend Caroline Ellison, who have chosen to cooperate with US courts.Bankman-Fried faces more than 100 years in prison in relation to the largest cryptocurrency-related bankruptcy in history: the FTX platform. He is accused of diverting clients' money to reinvest it in high-risk bets in the Bahamas through a trading subsidiary called Alameda.Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has survived the turmoil and is currently trading at around $27,200, which is 40% higher than a year ago but less than half of the $69,000 peak it reached in November 2021 during the speculative frenzy. No one believes that these currencies, which have no underlying assets, are secure, as the platforms meant to host them often turn out to be traps, like FTX, the platform founded by SBF.The crisis has its roots in 2021 when the post-Covid bubble began to deflate. The value of many cryptocurrencies started to plummet, as did some trading platforms, but FTX appeared to be a safe haven, like its rival, Binance. Things took a turn for the worse in November 2022, when an article by the media outlet CoinDesk revealed that Alameda had converted a significant portion of its assets into FTT, a cryptocurrency created by FTX, exposing it to a currency collapse.Savers rushed to withdraw their funds, adding to the panic. Bankman-Fried tried to seek salvation from his rival, Binance, but it abandoned him. On November 6, 2022, Binance's CEO Changpeng Zhao, a 45-year-old Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur, decided to withdraw around $500 million in cryptocurrencies from the FTX platform.The fall was inevitable.

'The EU would benefit greatly from regulating AI',"With the US a technological driving force, Europe wants to be a pioneer in regulating AI, writes digital ethics specialist Laurence Devillers.","In today's tense geopolitical context, technological warfare rages on. ""The one who becomes the leader in this sphere (of artificial intelligence) will be the ruler of the world,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin told students in 2017 in Yaroslavl. The race for ever more powerful systems is also accelerating AI capabilities and its takeover.The challenges of increasing fake news stories have come to the fore with the deployment of generative artificial intelligence systems such as Dall-E and StableDiffusion for images and videos and ChatGPT, which uses language models from OpenAI. While the ChatGPT conversational robot can produce useful essays and summaries, it is impossible to know its sources or measure the influence of the dominant English language in its models. ChatGPT has rightly triggered excitement and fear among the general public, with questions such as: ""Should it be banned from schools?""; ""Will it take my job?"" or ""Will I be able to do without it?""For these huge models, Europe intends to propose joint responsibility between the manufacturers of the models who put them on the market or publish them in open access, those who deploy them, and those who use them. This is not an idea that is shared by the American digital giants' managers, who would prefer to shift responsibility to users instead. Silicon Valley technology aficionados Elon Musk, OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman, and many others are also ideologues with a global political vision. The United States, like China, is calling for standards in this race to dominate the technological landscape while stimulating innovation, the guarantor of power.The European Union has much to gain by developing a framework for the use of AI associated with trust and respect for human rights and the rule of law. Its AI Act, under preparation, focuses on identifying applications that present a risk and therefore require regulation.Four levels of risk (unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal) call for different actions. Unacceptably risky applications will be banned, for example, for manipulative ""subliminal techniques"" that exploit specific vulnerable groups or are used by public authorities for social evaluation purposes, as in China. High-risk applications will be tightly regulated. This should be with a high level of specificity to preserve useful applications. For example, facial recognition is a danger if used to monitor the population, but it is proving to be a very useful tool for monitoring pathologies in patients. The AI Act therefore proposes to offer protection. In particular, it imposes obligations on certain AI systems because of the specific risks they present to algorithms interacting with humans.",Pixels,todays tense geopolitical context technological warfare rages one becomes leader sphere artificial intelligence ruler world russian president vladimir putin told students yaroslavl race ever powerful systems also accelerating capabilities takeover challenges increasing fake news stories come fore deployment generative artificial intelligence systems dall stablediffusion images videos chatgpt uses language models openai chatgpt conversational robot produce useful essays summaries impossible know sources measure influence dominant english language models chatgpt rightly triggered excitement fear among general public questions banned schools take job able without huge models europe intends propose joint responsibility manufacturers models put market publish open access deploy use idea shared american digital giants managers would prefer shift responsibility users instead silicon valley technology aficionados elon musk openai founder sam altman many others also ideologues global political vision united states like china calling standards race dominate technological landscape stimulating innovation guarantor power european union much gain developing framework use associated trust respect human rights rule law act preparation focuses identifying applications present risk therefore require regulation four levels risk unacceptable high limited minimal call different actions unacceptably risky applications banned example manipulative subliminal techniques exploit specific vulnerable groups used public authorities social evaluation purposes china high risk applications tightly regulated high level specificity preserve useful applications example facial recognition danger used monitor population proving useful tool monitoring pathologies patients act therefore proposes offer protection particular imposes obligations certain systems specific risks present algorithms interacting humans,today tens geopolit context technolog warfar rage one becom leader sphere artifici intellig ruler world russian presid vladimir putin told student yaroslavl race ever power system also acceler capabl takeov challeng increas fake news stori come fore deploy gener artifici intellig system dall stablediffus imag video chatgpt use languag model openai chatgpt convers robot produc use essay summari imposs know sourc measur influenc domin english languag model chatgpt rightli trigger excit fear among gener public question ban school take job abl without huge model europ intend propos joint respons manufactur model put market publish open access deploy use idea share american digit giant manag would prefer shift respons user instead silicon valley technolog aficionado elon musk openai founder sam altman mani other also ideologu global polit vision unit state like china call standard race domin technolog landscap stimul innov guarantor power european union much gain develop framework use associ trust respect human right rule law act prepar focus identifi applic present risk therefor requir regul four level risk unaccept high limit minim call differ action unaccept riski applic ban exampl manipul sublimin techniqu exploit specif vulner group use public author social evalu purpos china high risk applic tightli regul high level specif preserv use applic exampl facial recognit danger use monitor popul prove use tool monitor patholog patient act therefor propos offer protect particular impos oblig certain system specif risk present algorithm interact human
"The great AI debate: 'Which is better, human or machine?'",Professor Brian Hill reports on an enlightening experiment in which his students worked with a chatbot. The findings suggest that the workers of tomorrow are likely to deliver significantly lower-quality work when assisted by AI tools than when working alone.,"When ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, a number of debates emerged, many of which revolved around an age-old question: Which is better, human or machine?Given the predicted importance that these tools will have in future professional practice, the real question is actually more nuanced: do humans do a better job on their own, or when they rely on artificial intelligence (AI)? More precisely: are they able to make good use of AI – to assess it correctly and correct its responses where necessary – to improve their performance?A recent study suggests that this question is not as clear-cut as one might think. It concerns an assignment given in a class at HEC Paris (France's most prestigious business school), in which each student was randomly assigned two case studies.For the first case, students had to write an answer to the assigned question from scratch. For the second, they received a ready-made answer, which they had to evaluate and, if necessary, correct. They were told that each answer could have been provided by ChatGPT, which was indeed the case for most of them. The students' final answers were graded using the same scoring system: the most important thing was to deliver a full reply to the question, whether it was the result of a correction or not (""Taking the help or going alone: ChatGPT and class assignments,"" June 2023).While the first exercise is representative of ""traditional"" work practices, the second may end up corresponding more closely to many jobs in the future. Indeed, if AI tools become as ubiquitous as many predict, the human role will be to evaluate and correct the results produced by AI.And yet, the students were less successful in this second exercise: the average mark for the corrected version of the ready-made answer was 28% lower than the average mark for the task in which students wrote their own answers. Even when controlling for the same case study, a student who corrected ChatGPT's work lost an average of 28 points out of 100 compared with a student working alone. In short, students perform much worse if they are provided with ChatGPT's help and then asked to correct it, than if they have to provide an answer from scratch.Are these results due to high student trust in ChatGPT's answers? The students were explicitly warned to be wary of the answers they were given: they were told that ChatGPT had been tested on a similar assignment and that it had achieved rather mediocre results.A more likely explanation would be confirmation bias, i.e. ""interpreting evidence in ways that are partial to existing beliefs, expectations, or a hypothesis in hand.""",Pixels,chatgpt launched november number debates emerged many revolved around age old question better human machine given predicted importance tools future professional practice real question actually nuanced humans better job rely artificial intelligence precisely able make good use assess correctly correct responses necessary improve performance recent study suggests question clear cut one might think concerns assignment given class hec paris frances prestigious business school student randomly assigned two case studies first case students write answer assigned question scratch second received ready made answer evaluate necessary correct told answer could provided chatgpt indeed case students final answers graded using scoring system important thing deliver full reply question whether result correction taking help going alone chatgpt class assignments june first exercise representative traditional work practices second may end corresponding closely many jobs future indeed tools become ubiquitous many predict human role evaluate correct results produced yet students less successful second exercise average mark corrected version ready made answer lower average mark task students wrote answers even controlling case study student corrected chatgpts work lost average points compared student working alone short students perform much worse provided chatgpts help asked correct provide answer scratch results due high student trust chatgpts answers students explicitly warned wary answers given told chatgpt tested similar assignment achieved rather mediocre results likely explanation would confirmation bias interpreting evidence ways partial existing beliefs expectations hypothesis hand,chatgpt launch novemb number debat emerg mani revolv around age old question better human machin given predict import tool futur profession practic real question actual nuanc human better job reli artifici intellig precis abl make good use assess correctli correct respons necessari improv perform recent studi suggest question clear cut one might think concern assign given class hec pari franc prestigi busi school student randomli assign two case studi first case student write answer assign question scratch second receiv readi made answer evalu necessari correct told answer could provid chatgpt inde case student final answer grade use score system import thing deliv full repli question whether result correct take help go alon chatgpt class assign june first exercis repres tradit work practic second may end correspond close mani job futur inde tool becom ubiquit mani predict human role evalu correct result produc yet student less success second exercis averag mark correct version readi made answer lower averag mark task student wrote answer even control case studi student correct chatgpt work lost averag point compar student work alon short student perform much wors provid chatgpt help ask correct provid answer scratch result due high student trust chatgpt answer student explicitli warn wari answer given told chatgpt test similar assign achiev rather mediocr result like explan would confirm bia interpret evid way partial exist belief expect hypothesi hand
What's in the French bill to 'secure and regulate digital space' from pornography and online harassment?,"    Portions of the bill, which also concerns scams, deepfakes, trolls and identification, might be difficult to negotiate on the floor of the Assemblée Nationale. ","Since Wednesday, October 4, MPs are debating one of the most important pieces of digital legislation of Emmanuel Macron's second term on the floor of the Assemblée Nationale, following the senators' unanimous vote on July 5. The bill to ""secure and regulate digital space"" (""sécuriser et réguler l’espace numérique"", SREN), championed by Junior Digital Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, is a patchwork of measures ranging from fighting online harassment to controlling access to pornographic sites, and even to combating phishing.Article 6 of the bill details what has been presented as an ""anti-scam filter"", designed to combat online crimes, mainly phishing. This concerns sites ""manifestly designed"" to carry out specific offenses: identity theft, illegal data collection, bank fraud and even hacking into a computer system. When such a site is discovered by the authorities, they can contact its publisher and ask them to put a stop to the offenses detected, and at the same time alert browser developers (Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, etc.), who must display a warning message to visitors.If it is impossible to identify and contact the publisher, the authorities can directly request that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Domain Name System (DNS, which route online traffic) providers block the offending domain name without delay. The idea of imposing such a restriction on browser developers, against which the Mozilla Foundation (which distributes Firefox software) had been particularly vocal, was finally abandoned. The main Web browsers already include tools to identify certain fraudulent sites and alert users who visit them.One of the main points of contention in the text is Article 1, which requires that the French Audiovisual and Digital Communication Regulatory Authority (ARCOM) publish a technical reference guide specifying the steps to be taken to implement an age verification tool on pornographic sites. A law passed in July 2020, which requires publishers of such sites to set up verification tools and decrees that a mere self-declaration is insufficient, already gave the ARCOM the possibility of establishing such a reference guide. But the authority never did so, and the leaders of the pornographic industry have used this in the courts, arguing that there is no reliable method that respects user privacy.The SREN bill stipulates that the ARCOM must publish this reference guide within six months after the law passes. However, some child protection associations as well as a number of MPs are opposed to this stipulation, believing that it provides pornographic sites with new ammunition with which to defend themselves.

"AI and culture, friends or foes?",Investigation,"""We try not to be afraid,"" said Steve Carell, in French. Constantin Pappas has seen many technological revolutions in his 40 years as a dubbing stalwart across 35-millimeter reels, video and digital. But, for the first time this summer, he felt like he had to restart his B&B project in the countryside. And AI can take the blame, with its immediate automated translation, actors with faces made eternal, the duplication of extras and algorithm-generated scenes.Jean-François Bonnefon, director of research in cognitive psychology at the Toulouse School of Economics, said, ""We're about to witness an upheaval in human culture which, in terms of its importance, is the equivalent of the return of the explorers from China in the time of Marco Polo, their arms laden with novelties such as paper money and the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg. All the great culture shocks known to European history are going to be concentrated in a few years.""As seen with the five-month strike that brought Hollywood to a standstill, the world of culture has turned upside down in the face of the programmed obsolescence of its professions. ""The only thing,"" Pappas said, ""is that if Robert De Niro was told: 'Your voice is going to be used in 37 countries in 37 languages,' I'm not sure he'd accept. Or he might ask for such a phenomenal sum that dubbing would remain a more economical solution.""The arrival on the market of ChatGPT at the beginning of the year was a wake-up call. This fall, not one film festival, not one publisher's meeting, not one musical gathering doesn't feature a round table on artificial intelligence. The word ""replacement"" keeps coming up everywhere. Civilization is threatened by the advent of a world of algorithms. ""The fear of a culture that we think threatens us, even if it's a question of stereotypes or prejudices, is even more accentuated with AI because nobody really knows what machine culture is like. And there's nothing to hold on to,"" said Bonnefon.Technophile economists may well predict that AI will also create jobs, according to Schumpeter's theory of creative destruction, but the fear is there. All the more so as, this time, it's no longer operational jobs that are being targeted, but decision-making and creative jobs, which previous generations had favored, and which seemed to us to be the most inextricably human. And behind this fear lies a much deeper, muted sense of replacement: that of the human being itself, the extinction of our species.",Pixels,try afraid said steve carell french constantin pappas seen many technological revolutions years dubbing stalwart across millimeter reels video digital first time summer felt like restart project countryside take blame immediate automated translation actors faces made eternal duplication extras algorithm generated scenes jean fran ois bonnefon director research cognitive psychology toulouse school economics said witness upheaval human culture terms importance equivalent return explorers china time marco polo arms laden novelties paper money invention printing press gutenberg great culture shocks known european history going concentrated years seen five month strike brought hollywood standstill world culture turned upside face programmed obsolescence professions thing pappas said robert niro told voice going used countries languages sure hed accept might ask phenomenal sum dubbing would remain economical solution arrival market chatgpt beginning year wake call fall one film festival one publishers meeting one musical gathering doesnt feature round table artificial intelligence word replacement keeps coming everywhere civilization threatened advent world algorithms fear culture think threatens even question stereotypes prejudices even accentuated nobody really knows machine culture like theres nothing hold said bonnefon technophile economists may well predict also create jobs according schumpeters theory creative destruction fear time longer operational jobs targeted decision making creative jobs previous generations favored seemed inextricably human behind fear lies much deeper muted sense replacement human extinction species,tri afraid said steve carel french constantin pappa seen mani technolog revolut year dub stalwart across millimet reel video digit first time summer felt like restart project countrysid take blame immedi autom translat actor face made etern duplic extra algorithm gener scene jean fran oi bonnefon director research cognit psycholog toulous school econom said wit upheav human cultur term import equival return explor china time marco polo arm laden novelti paper money invent print press gutenberg great cultur shock known european histori go concentr year seen five month strike brought hollywood standstil world cultur turn upsid face program obsolesc profess thing pappa said robert niro told voic go use countri languag sure hed accept might ask phenomen sum dub would remain econom solut arriv market chatgpt begin year wake call fall one film festiv one publish meet one music gather doesnt featur round tabl artifici intellig word replac keep come everywher civil threaten advent world algorithm fear cultur think threaten even question stereotyp prejudic even accentu nobodi realli know machin cultur like there noth hold said bonnefon technophil economist may well predict also creat job accord schumpet theori creativ destruct fear time longer oper job target decis make creativ job previou gener favor seem inextric human behind fear lie much deeper mute sens replac human extinct speci
"On TikTok, the success of 'sliced up' films and TV series","    Users of the social media app have grown accustomed to viewing posts by anonymous accounts showing works broken up into a series of videos. In light of this success, producers are looking to imitate them. ","On Tuesday, October 3, production company Paramount Pictures pulled off a marketing coup on TikTok by publishing one of its 2004 hits on the platform free of charge: Mean Girls by Mark Waters. Users could watch one of the most iconic films in the career of 2000s icon Lindsay Lohan, free of charge. For the occasion, the film was cut into 23 short videos.Why this film? Emblematic of online culture, Mean Girls is a reservoir of memes from which internet users like to draw to invoke the figure of the popular but insensitive and superficial person.Why this day? Because one of the characters refers to this date in the feature film and it has evolved into ""Mean Girls Day."" Finally, the choice of format was inspired by the hundreds of accounts on the platform that illegally broadcast reports, series and even films – including Mean Girls. In August, NBC relied on the same strategy, previewing an episode of its comedy Killing It, as The Guardian reported.This is because, on TikTok, users are crazy about these works, which, to comply with the platform's standards, are broken up into short videos. Excerpts from blockbusters, romantic comedies and TV shows can reach thousands of views. So much so, in fact, that it is not uncommon for them to appear on the application's home page (the ""For You"" feed). Some users even purposely leave the message ""I'm commenting for the algorithm"" under an excerpt, in the hope of being automatically offered the rest of the video. It is a practice described in the 2023 book Le Système TikTok by journalist Océane Herrero.But this is nothing new: Back in the 2000s, with the spread of piracy, many internet users were already downloading films in chunks. Later, video-sharing sites such as YouTube also saw the emergence of unlicensed publications of fragmented films.On TikTok, this content is increasingly numerous, bringing back into fashion movies that are sometimes several decades old, as Radio Canada points out, or giving new popularity to hits like Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" (1977). Series or films from the past such as Mean Girls, Legally Blonde (2001) and Malcolm in the Middle (2000-2006) are also popular. The presence of this copyright-protected content seems to be moderated with uneven zeal by the platform, which also raises questions as to the tolerance level of production companies regarding this practice.One might suspect that rights holders are counting on the fact that these video snippets have the effect of a trailer or teaser, and encourage the less relentless internet users to view films in a more conventional, legal and, above all, more comfortable way. Their effectiveness remains to be seen, but they illustrate TikTok's growing influence on the way internet users consume audiovisual content.In any case, Mean Girls has since disappeared from the official TikTok account @meangirls, which now boasts 154,000 subscriptions.",Pixels,tuesday october production company paramount pulled marketing coup tiktok publishing one hits platform free charge mean girls mark waters users could watch one iconic films career icon lindsay lohan free charge occasion film cut short videos film emblematic online culture mean girls reservoir memes internet users like draw invoke figure popular insensitive superficial person day one characters refers date feature film evolved mean girls day finally choice format inspired hundreds accounts platform illegally broadcast reports series even films including mean girls august nbc relied strategy previewing episode comedy killing guardian reported tiktok users crazy works comply platforms standards broken short videos excerpts blockbusters romantic comedies shows reach thousands views much fact uncommon appear applications home page feed users even purposely leave message commenting algorithm excerpt hope automatically offered rest video practice described book syst tiktok journalist ane herrero nothing new back spread piracy many internet users already downloading films chunks later video sharing sites youtube also saw emergence unlicensed publications fragmented films tiktok content increasingly numerous bringing back fashion movies sometimes several decades old radio canada points giving new popularity hits like fleetwood macs dreams series films past mean girls legally blonde malcolm middle also popular presence copyright protected content seems moderated uneven zeal platform also raises questions tolerance level production companies regarding practice one might suspect rights holders counting fact video snippets effect trailer teaser encourage less relentless internet users view films conventional legal comfortable way effectiveness remains seen illustrate tiktoks growing influence way internet users consume audiovisual content case mean girls since disappeared official tiktok account boasts subscriptions,tuesday octob product compani paramount pull market coup tiktok publish one hit platform free charg mean girl mark water user could watch one icon film career icon lindsay lohan free charg occas film cut short video film emblemat onlin cultur mean girl reservoir meme internet user like draw invok figur popular insensit superfici person day one charact refer date featur film evolv mean girl day final choic format inspir hundr account platform illeg broadcast report seri even film includ mean girl august nbc reli strategi preview episod comedi kill guardian report tiktok user crazi work compli platform standard broken short video excerpt blockbust romant comedi show reach thousand view much fact uncommon appear applic home page feed user even purpos leav messag comment algorithm excerpt hope automat offer rest video practic describ book syst tiktok journalist ane herrero noth new back spread piraci mani internet user alreadi download film chunk later video share site youtub also saw emerg unlicens public fragment film tiktok content increasingli numer bring back fashion movi sometim sever decad old radio canada point give new popular hit like fleetwood mac dream seri film past mean girl legal blond malcolm middl also popular presenc copyright protect content seem moder uneven zeal platform also rais question toler level product compani regard practic one might suspect right holder count fact video snippet effect trailer teaser encourag less relentless internet user view film convent legal comfort way effect remain seen illustr tiktok grow influenc way internet user consum audiovisu content case mean girl sinc disappear offici tiktok account boast subscript
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets have their own world championship,In Depth,"Forget the Rugby World Cup and the end of its group stage this weekend. Another international competition kicked off on Saturday, October 7: the Microsoft Excel World Championship (MEWC). For two months, 128 contestants will compete for the trophy, won last year by Andrew Ngai of Australia.At first glance, nothing seems further removed than Excel from the most famous competitive video games, such as League of Legends or Counter-Strike. Yet the format of the championship is reminiscent of e-sports, with online events, games with commentary and cash prizes – $15,000 (more than €14,000) – to reward the top finishers. The final, scheduled for December 7, will even be held at the HyperX Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, where video game tournaments regularly take place.But unlike e-sports enthusiasts, young prodigies of the joystick or keyboard who turn their hobby into a profession, MEWC participants do the opposite: As experienced professionals, they explore the playful aspects of their work tool.""I take part in this competition to have fun and it also allows me to improve,"" explained Barbara Mauric, a 48-year-old management controller for Italian shipowner d'Amico. Mauric, who has been using Excel on a daily basis since 2008, said, ""I learn various things about the software from the other participants and can apply them to other situations.""Mauric is competing in the Financial Modeling World Cup (FMWC), a competition whose origins date back to 2012 and which, in its current form, is organized by AG Capital, the creator of the Excel World Championship. The FMWC – where the spreadsheet is also king – features a number of events in which contestants must use the financial data of a fictitious company to make a projection of potential performance.Wishing to reach a wider audience, AG Capital's CEO, Andrew Grigolyunovich of Latvia, subsequently launched the MEWC in 2021. ""There are a huge number of people who know Excel but don't have a finance background. For example, there are mathematicians or engineers who are very good at it, and I wanted to see them take part in this kind of competition anyway,"" said Grigolyunovich, who used to compete in financial modeling tournaments himself.The tests offered to contestants now resemble puzzles in worlds far removed from that of business: slot-machine screens whose scores must be calculated, race tracks to get through by rolling dice or tables of biathlon competition results to decipher. Bear Island, for example, consists of a series of problems to be solved using a map of an island inhabited by wild animals, drawn by coloring in the cells.Each challenge has to be solved within 30 minutes, but the matches aren't all about completing the maximum number of tasks in the allotted time. To win, you need to find the most effective formulas and tools to earn the maximum number of points by achieving predefined objectives. The competition is like Excel: It favors efficiency and rigor.""What's so special about these tests is that you have to ask yourself: 'Well, what approach am I going to take? What's it going to be like compared to the others? Because we don't have much time and we're stressed, there are things we don't think about,"" said Nicolas Micot, a 27-year-old risk manager for a company in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of France. Micot, who reached the second qualifying round in 2022, added, ""Afterward, you can look at the others on the stream and say to yourself: 'Darn, it's true that if I'd done that, I wouldn't have gotten so worked up about it,.'""But how entertaining is it to watch people fill in Excel spreadsheets? ""From the outset, I wanted it to be fun to watch,"" said Grigolyunovich. To achieve this, he drew direct inspiration from the conventions of e-sports, imagining ""battle"" formats in which up to eight players compete, and enlisted the help of a colorful commentator, Excel trainer and videographer Oz du Soleil.To ensure audience loyalty, organizers also encourage participants to turn on their webcams and feature certain leading figures. Irish virtuoso Diarmuid Early, dubbed the ""Michael Jordan of Excel"" by the community, has increasingly been featured in YouTube videos and publications on the social media platform LinkedIn, just like the reigning world champion.The competition has reached a wide audience at last, thanks to its broadcast on US television. Since last year, the championship has been reaired on the sports channel ESPN, which has a program dedicated to the most unexpected disciplines, such as competitive tag. ""I'm glad it's interesting even for those who don't work with Excel,"" said Mauric, amused by the program's success. ""We'll see what they come up with in the future to keep us on our toes.""And that's not to mention the obvious interest for Microsoft. ""Watching matches is great advertising for new versions of the software,"" added Micot. ""The latest version includes new formulas that are used by certain players. This is bound to inspire other software developers and owners.""",Pixels,forget rugby world cup end group stage weekend another international competition kicked saturday october microsoft excel world

'Generative AI doesn't hesitate to plagiarize on a massive scale',Computer scientist Serge Abiteboul calls for a clear distinction to be made between creations by humans and those by artificial intelligence.,"Binaire is a blog hosted by Le Monde, the brainchild of a group of friends. To talk about computers, digital technology and science, we look for topics and then for authors. We then ask the authors to write an article on the chosen topic. This work competes with our other activities: work, pétanque, aperitifs, etc.A lazy idea (like all the best ideas) would be to ask artificial intelligence (AI) to do the work for us. This would involve helping us find hot topics and possible authors. But let's go crazy – why not just place our order outright? ""AI, write us an article for Binaire in the style of a particular one of our authors, on quantum computing or the blockchain.""Let's quickly recall how these AIs work. A deep neural network is fed huge quantities of text. From this, it builds a large language model. It can then produce the most likely combinations of words around the instructions given to it, without understanding anything about it. There's nothing magical about it, even if the technique is actually a tad more complex. But the results are impressive.Generative AIs work off of all the texts they've been fed. What's new about that? Writers also draw inspiration from all the texts they've read. In a way, they too write based on an (intuitive) language model that they construct from what they have read. They also borrow, although we call them inspirations, references, and so on when it comes to human writing.So, what does generative AI change? First of all, it doesn't hesitate to plagiarize on a massive scale, obviously without the slightest awareness of doing so. Another difference is that today, these AIs are content to generate text without understanding the meaning of what they're saying. But what about tomorrow? When they hide their ""borrowings"" better, when the ""monkey trick"" stage of AIs has been surpassed, it won't be so simple to see a difference.And if we tolerate such plundering, why bother paying a creator if AI can do the same work at a lower cost? The answer is obvious: because these AIs only exist by feeding off human creations. Beyond those creations that have passed into the public domain, living humans are indispensable in order for AIs to talk about current events, adapt to the constant evolution of language and to stay ""connected.""In fact, some creators are beginning to ask to be compensated for what these generative AIs borrow from them. They are taking legal action based on copyright law. Whether they are writers, journalists, code developers, or illustrators, this concern seems legitimate, even if the borrowings are not always easy to prove.",Pixels,binaire blog hosted monde brainchild group friends talk computers digital technology science look topics authors ask authors write article chosen topic work competes activities work tanque aperitifs etc lazy idea like best ideas would ask artificial intelligence work would involve helping find hot topics possible authors lets crazy place order outright write article binaire style particular one authors quantum computing blockchain lets quickly recall ais work deep neural network fed huge quantities text builds large language model produce likely combinations words around instructions given without understanding anything theres nothing magical even technique actually tad complex results impressive generative ais work texts theyve fed whats new writers also draw inspiration texts theyve read way write based intuitive language model construct read also borrow although call inspirations references comes human writing generative change first doesnt hesitate plagiarize massive scale obviously without slightest awareness another difference today ais content generate text without understanding meaning theyre saying tomorrow hide borrowings better monkey trick stage ais surpassed wont simple see difference tolerate plundering bother paying creator work lower cost answer obvious ais exist feeding human creations beyond creations passed public domain living humans indispensable order ais talk current events adapt constant evolution language stay connected fact creators beginning ask compensated generative ais borrow taking legal action based copyright law whether writers journalists code developers illustrators concern seems legitimate even borrowings always easy prove,binair blog host mond brainchild group friend talk comput digit technolog scienc look topic author ask author write articl chosen topic work compet activ work tanqu aperitif etc lazi idea like best idea would ask artifici intellig work would involv help find hot topic possibl author let crazi place order outright write articl binair style particular one author quantum comput blockchain let quickli recal ai work deep neural network fed huge quantiti text build larg languag model produc like combin word around instruct given without understand anyth there noth magic even techniqu actual tad complex result impress gener ai work text theyv fed what new writer also draw inspir text theyv read way write base intuit languag model construct read also borrow although call inspir refer come human write gener chang first doesnt hesit plagiar massiv scale obvious without slightest awar anoth differ today ai content gener text without understand mean theyr say tomorrow hide borrow better monkey trick stage ai surpass wont simpl see differ toler plunder bother pay creator work lower cost answer obviou ai exist feed human creation beyond creation pass public domain live human indispens order ai talk current event adapt constant evolut languag stay connect fact creator begin ask compens gener ai borrow take legal action base copyright law whether writer journalist code develop illustr concern seem legitim even borrow alway easi prove
"'ChatGPT, what are we doing for dinner tonight?'","    AI will revolutionize the economy, education and intellectual and artistic creation. But today, those who embrace it without delay often have more prosaic objectives. ","Anyone who has tried to settle disagreements by letter knows that the difficulty lies not so much in the time spent writing it, but in the time spent brooding over it. That's what Nolan, a young town-planning engineer from Lorient (northwestern France), told himself when he asked ChatGPT to reply in his place to the estate agent with whom he was in conflict over some work to be carried out. ""He had written to me in a very unpleasant tone. I asked ChatGPT for a very respectful letter, with a lot of kindness, in a literary and formal style."" Basically, the opposite of what he had set out to write. He found the result effective: The agent in question didn't come forward again and, more importantly, it allowed Nolan to ""not spend too much time on an unpleasant task."" Normally, he asks the artificial intelligence (AI) to write him specifications for the construction of parking lots, or statements of decision at the end of work meetings.ChatGPT, the tool developed by OpenAI that offers on-demand text using artificial intelligence, has been the talk of the town since it was unveiled in November 2022. Like other artificial intelligence systems, such as Bard or Aria, it raises two big questions: Will AI take our jobs? And will it allow students to cheat at school? Most of the first books published explaining how to use AI aim to make readers money or improve their personal productivity, as if work and study were the only reservoirs of tasks to be outsourced. And yet, when we ask users to consult the history of their most recent queries, we see just how many everyday challenges could do with a helping hand.With his teenage son, Romain Meunier, a comic book author based in Reims (northeastern France), called on AI when he realized that the blackberries he'd bought were too acidic. ""We also had peppers that we didn't know what to do with, and people were coming for dinner."" ChatGPT suggested dishes for them to cook, including a blackberry cream that turned out excellent (the muffins and toast were great, too). Father and son certainly worded their request better than Vincent Flibustier, a trainer in media literacy and fake news, who had asked the artificial intelligence for ""creative ideas for using all the zucchini from [his] brother's harvest."" ChatGPT's suggestions included a zucchini castle contest, around which the algorithm proposed organizing a medieval festival. (The idea of freezing the zucchini cut into pieces to preserve them was not deemed ""creative"" enough).",Pixels,anyone tried settle disagreements letter knows difficulty lies much time spent writing time spent brooding thats nolan young town planning engineer lorient northwestern france told asked chatgpt reply place estate agent conflict work carried written unpleasant tone asked chatgpt respectful letter lot kindness literary formal style basically opposite set write found result effective agent question didnt come forward importantly allowed nolan spend much time unpleasant task normally asks artificial intelligence write specifications construction parking lots statements decision end work meetings chatgpt tool developed openai offers demand text using artificial intelligence talk town since unveiled november like artificial intelligence systems bard aria raises two big questions take jobs allow students cheat school first books published explaining use aim make readers money improve personal productivity work study reservoirs tasks outsourced yet ask users consult history recent queries see many everyday challenges could helping hand teenage son romain meunier comic book author based reims northeastern france called realized blackberries hed bought acidic also peppers didnt know people coming dinner chatgpt suggested dishes cook including blackberry cream turned excellent muffins toast great father son certainly worded request better vincent flibustier trainer media literacy fake news asked artificial intelligence creative ideas using zucchini brothers harvest chatgpts suggestions included zucchini castle contest around algorithm proposed organizing medieval festival idea freezing zucchini cut pieces preserve deemed creative enough,anyon tri settl disagr letter know difficulti lie much time spent write time spent brood that nolan young town plan engin lorient northwestern franc told ask chatgpt repli place estat agent conflict work carri written unpleas tone ask chatgpt respect letter lot kind literari formal style basic opposit set write found result effect agent question didnt come forward importantli allow nolan spend much time unpleas task normal ask artifici intellig write specif construct park lot statement decis end work meet chatgpt tool develop openai offer demand text use artifici intellig talk town sinc unveil novemb like artifici intellig system bard aria rais two big question take job allow student cheat school first book publish explain use aim make reader money improv person product work studi reservoir task outsourc yet ask user consult histori recent queri see mani everyday challeng could help hand teenag son romain meunier comic book author base reim northeastern franc call realiz blackberri hed bought acid also pepper didnt know peopl come dinner chatgpt suggest dish cook includ blackberri cream turn excel muffin toast great father son certainli word request better vincent flibusti trainer media literaci fake news ask artifici intellig creativ idea use zucchini brother harvest chatgpt suggest includ zucchini castl contest around algorithm propos organ mediev festiv idea freez zucchini cut piec preserv deem creativ enough
EU warns Musk that Hamas attack disinformation is spreading on his platform X,"    Following Hamas' attack on Israel, EU commissioner Thierry Breton issued a stern warning to Musk, raising concerns about X's compliance with the EU Digital Services Act. ","EU commissioner Thierry Breton warned Elon Musk on Tuesday, October 10, that his platform X, formerly Twitter, is spreading ""illegal content and disinformation"", in a letter seen by AFP. The letter said concerns had heightened after the Hamas attack against Israel, and demanded Musk respond to the complaint within 24 hours and contact ""relevant law enforcement authorities"".As the European Union's commissioner for the Internal Market, Breton is charged with regulating internet giants that trade within the bloc and can launch legal action. ""Following the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas against Israel, we have indications that your platform is being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU,"" Breton wrote.Breton reminded Musk that EU law sets tough rules on moderating content, ""especially when it comes to violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform"". He asked that X respond to his complaint within 24 hours and also get in touch with Europol, the EU police coordinating agency.""We will include your answer in our assessment file on your compliance with the DSA,"" Breton said, referring to the new EU Digital Services Act, which regulates online platforms. ""I remind you that following the opening of a potential investigation and a finding of non-compliance, penalties can be imposed,"" it said.Musk, responding later on X to a user who had posted the letter, invited Breton to ""please list the violations you allude to"". ""Our policy is that everything is open source and transparent, an approach that I know the EU supports,"" Musk wrote.Brussels has previously complained that, among the large-scale internet platforms that fall under the DSA remit, Musk's Twitter, now rebranded X, spreads the biggest proportion of disinformation. In August, when the new law came into effect, Musk replied to a post by Breton promising that the platform was ""working hard"" to comply, but there have been more warning signs.While the rules were still voluntary, the firm pulled out of an oversight group, and Musk – a self-styled ""free speech absolutist"" – has been dismissive of criticism in his personal posts. In September, the billionaire tech mogul boasted that he had cut half of its global team dedicated to monitoring and limiting disinformation and fraud around major elections.Since Saturday's shock attack on Israeli communities by the Hamas militant group, web platforms have been swamped by posts containing fake or misrepresented reports and footage.

Pommard vs Pomerol: Showdown between Burgundy and Bordeaux red wines,"They sound the same, have the same prestige – but their taste is very different. Don't confuse Pommard and Pomerol anymore.","A Pommard is a red wine from Burgundy, from the Côte de Beaune, and more precisely the area between Beaune and Volnay, in the Côte-d'Or (east). Not surprisingly, it is a pinot noir, the grape variety of the great Burgundian red wines. Pommard has an excellent reputation. The wines are rare and expensive: It is hard to find bottles under 30 euros (you can always write to me if you have a foolproof plan); you're better off aiming for the upper-limit of contactless payment, namely around 50 euros. And you'll need to triple this amount for the stars of this 'village appellation.'Pommard has a starring role, halfway between Sean Penn and Liam Neeson. Unexpectedly muscular, but we will come back to that. A star, in any case, and what's more, out of the 340+ hectares of the appellation, a third is classed as premier cru. That means there are 28 ""climats"" (ancestral name for the Burgundy terroirs ) which stand out from the others (which are already very distinguished). Of these, the most prized are the Rugiens Hauts, the Rugiens Bas and the three Epenots, in particular the Clos des Epenots.The reputation of Pommard is not only excellent; it is bold and solid. Since the Middle Ages, this wine, of which there are 218 producers today, has been considered the mightiest of the Burgundian reds. This can be seen in its color, which is particularly intense for a wine from this region, as well as its vatting time (maceration in vats, at the beginning of the vinification process), which is longer than that of its neighbors. And above all, in the glass itself, owing to its tannins and its density – very unusual in Burgundies – and a lingering power and structure. This is why it is advisable to wait a good ten years, more if possible, before opening them. These are wines that mature well, allowing for a fuller aromatic bouquet and a softer texture.Faced with this very distinctive identity that contributes to its renown, nowadays you can find finer Pommards, perhaps less destined for lengthy aging but which thrill those who lack patience. Finally, it should be noted that the Pommard appellation should not be confused with the Château de Pommard, a vast estate that produces many other appellations in addition to Pommard.A Pomerol is a red wine from Bordeaux. From the right bank, more precisely between Libourne and Saint-Emilion (Gironde), whose vineyards join each other. As is usual on this bank, the Merlot grape is on show in a Pomerol (80% of the grapes), while the rest is a mixture, depending on the blends, of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and a smidge of Malbec.",Travel,pommard red wine burgundy beaune precisely area beaune volnay dor east surprisingly pinot noir grape variety great burgundian red wines pommard excellent reputation wines rare expensive hard find bottles euros always write foolproof plan youre better aiming upper limit contactless payment namely around euros youll need triple amount stars village appellation pommard starring role halfway sean penn liam neeson unexpectedly muscular come back star case whats hectares appellation third classed premier cru means climats ancestral name burgundy terroirs stand others already distinguished prized rugiens hauts rugiens bas three epenots particular clos des epenots reputation pommard excellent bold solid since middle ages wine producers today considered mightiest burgundian reds seen color particularly intense wine region well vatting time maceration vats beginning vinification process longer neighbors glass owing tannins density unusual burgundies lingering power structure advisable wait good ten years possible opening wines mature well allowing fuller aromatic bouquet softer texture faced distinctive identity contributes renown nowadays find finer pommards perhaps less destined lengthy aging thrill lack patience finally noted pommard appellation confused teau pommard vast estate produces many appellations addition pommard pomerol red wine bordeaux right bank precisely libourne saint emilion gironde whose vineyards join usual bank merlot grape show pomerol grapes rest mixture depending blends cabernet franc cabernet sauvignon smidge malbec,pommard red wine burgundi beaun precis area beaun volnay dor east surprisingli pinot noir grape varieti great burgundian red wine pommard excel reput wine rare expens hard find bottl euro alway write foolproof plan your better aim upper limit contactless payment name around euro youll need tripl amount star villag appel pommard star role halfway sean penn liam neeson unexpectedli muscular come back star case what hectar appel third class premier cru mean climat ancestr name burgundi terroir stand other alreadi distinguish prize rugien haut rugien ba three epenot particular clo de epenot reput pommard excel bold solid sinc middl age wine produc today consid mightiest burgundian red seen color particularli intens wine region well vat time macer vat begin vinif process longer neighbor glass owe tannin densiti unusu burgundi linger power structur advis wait good ten year possibl open wine matur well allow fuller aromat bouquet softer textur face distinct ident contribut renown nowaday find finer pommard perhap less destin lengthi age thrill lack patienc final note pommard appel confus teau pommard vast estat produc mani appel addit pommard pomerol red wine bordeaux right bank precis libourn saint emilion girond whose vineyard join usual bank merlot grape show pomerol grape rest mixtur depend blend cabernet franc cabernet sauvignon smidg malbec
48 hours in Karlsruhe,"    Discover Karl's dream castle, stroll through medieval Durlach, have lunch in the middle of start-ups and dive into the virtual world at the ZKM: in this beautiful German city, less than three hours from Paris, the journey becomes a temporal one.

If it opens at 7:30 am, the surrounding cafes, them, serve only from ... 9 hours. Fallback solution: the coffee stand. But the espresso, it will be standing! Or on a bench in front of the Krautkopfbrunnen, a fountain from the beginning of the 20th century, decorated with nine plump little men carrying a garland of fruit and flowers. Above, a metal structure topped by a cabbage head. The decoration is planted.In this chilly month of March, the stands are few, yet there is nothing missing: organic fruits and vegetables, or not, cheesemaker, butcher, baker, florist, food trucks of Indian cuisine, falafels and ... screening stand Covid-19!9 hours The Red PyramidChange of square, direction Marktplatz (2) where another market is located part of the year - the flower market is held here almost every day. It is the heart of the city center, where the neoclassical town hall (1825) and the evangelical church (1807-1816) with its six Corinthian columns face each other. In the middle, the red sandstone pyramid (1823) stands above the tomb of the founder of Karlsruhe, Karl Wilhelm, Margrave of Baden-Durlach.The Friedrichsplatz (3), where the natural history museum stands, is home to the Christmas market, which is already far away. White and purple crocuses brighten up its flowerbeds, which stretch across the square. A parallel street, the Herrenstrasse, leads to the Federal Court of Justice, the highest court in Germany. For Karlsruhe is ""the"" city of law in Germany. It is also the seat of the Federal Constitutional Court.10:30 a.m. Art Nouveau and MargaritaOn Ludwigsplatz, it is the terraces of restaurants and bars that take their ease.

Munich's beer flowed freely here. Today, it is rather the margarita.Another Art Nouveau building, at the corner of Kaiserstrasse and Karlstrasse, is worth a visit, the Zum Moninger (1901) - named after a brewer.

"On board the snow train, the Wild West version of Sweden","    The splendors of Orsa Lake, the sauna in the middle of the Asarna woods, the unique light of Östersund... In winter, riding the Snötaget is a way of discovering Sweden from the inside, taking your time. ","A white Wild West, not because of its vastness, but because of its wild nature. Miles of snow-covered pine and fir forests. Frozen lakes as far as the eye can see, the odd house, just a few hills to give a little depth and roundness to the landscape. You have to like repetition to experience this change of scenery, and above all take your time.This is the secret of this journey aboard the Snötaget, the snow train. A journey that begins in Mora, right in the middle of Sweden. It's a small town known for the Vasaloppet, the kingdom's most popular annual cross-country ski race, which follows a course of about 90 kilometers between Malung-Sälen and Mora. It is March, and everything is in place, stands and banners, to welcome the 16,000 skiers and celebrate its 100th anniversary.The resort is teeming with people. Our train is an old red and white carriage, the likes of which you no longer see. It stands out in this landscape, from which modern trains set off for Stockholm. Pelle Björkman is one of its drivers. His gray beard is as long as the years he's spent on the Inlandsbanan. A train from yesteryear that narrowly escaped the sidings. The line was created at the end of the 19th century, in order to open a way of communication  from south and north, in the middle of the wilderness, hence its name: Inlandsbanan, ""the way of the interior.""The line, completed in 1937, experienced difficulties in the 1960s with the advent of the car. It reopened in 2012 thanks to the battle led by the 19 municipalities it served. Since then, the Inlandsbanan has had a seasonal rhythm: in summer, it crosses, from south to north, 1,299 kilometers between Mora and Gällivare in two days; in winter, it transforms into a snow train, the Snötaget, and stops in Östersund, a total of 596 kilometers in one day.We will spend five days aboard the Snötaget. Journey time: a time of idle ambling, when lounging and dreaming are permitted, as well as randomly picking out stations on the map to stop for a night. Ours are called Orsa, Arsana and Östersund. There are about 10 travelers in the train's only carriage. Mélanie and Éloise Warenbourg, two French women, are tracking the northern lights of Abisko in Lapland. In Östersund, they will board another train to reach the Far North. ""I feel like I'm outside of time and it's weird to see faces,"" says Melanie, masks not being mandatory in Sweden.Fredrik Olofsson is a controller who has been working on this line for two months. He gives some instructions and then comments humorously on the landscapes we cross. The train honks curiously at random moments: Pelle Björkman, the driver, tells us that it is to warn the wild animals, the cars and the snowmobiles of our arrival. There are very few barriers, except in Sveg, where the bridge is used by other vehicles. From his cabin, he is proud to show us the black box that allows the barrier to be raised and lowered.",Travel,white wild west vastness wild nature miles snow covered pine fir forests frozen lakes far eye see odd house hills give little depth roundness landscape like repetition experience change scenery take time secret journey aboard taget snow train journey begins mora right middle sweden small town known vasaloppet kingdoms popular annual cross country ski race follows course kilometers malung len mora march everything place stands banners welcome skiers celebrate anniversary resort teeming people train old red white carriage likes longer see stands landscape modern trains set stockholm pelle rkman one drivers gray beard long years hes spent inlandsbanan train yesteryear narrowly escaped sidings line created end century order open way communication south north middle wilderness hence name inlandsbanan way interior line completed experienced difficulties advent car reopened thanks battle led municipalities served since inlandsbanan seasonal rhythm summer crosses south north kilometers mora llivare two days winter transforms snow train taget stops stersund total kilometers one day spend five days aboard taget journey time time idle ambling lounging dreaming permitted well randomly stations map stop night called orsa arsana stersund travelers trains carriage lanie loise warenbourg two french women tracking northern lights abisko lapland stersund board another train reach far north feel like outside time weird see faces says melanie masks mandatory sweden fredrik olofsson controller working line two months gives instructions comments humorously landscapes cross train honks curiously random moments pelle rkman driver tells warn wild animals cars snowmobiles arrival barriers except sveg bridge used vehicles cabin proud show black box allows barrier raised lowered,white wild west vast wild natur mile snow cover pine fir forest frozen lake far eye see odd hous hill give littl depth round landscap like repetit experi chang sceneri take time secret journey aboard taget snow train journey begin mora right middl sweden small town known vasaloppet kingdom popular annual cross countri ski race follow cours kilomet malung len mora march everyth place stand banner welcom skier celebr anniversari resort teem peopl train old red white carriag like longer see stand landscap modern train set stockholm pell rkman one driver gray beard long year he spent inlandsbanan train yesteryear narrowli escap side line creat end centuri order open way commun south north middl wilder henc name inlandsbanan way interior line complet experienc difficulti advent car reopen thank battl led municip serv sinc inlandsbanan season rhythm summer cross south north kilomet mora llivar two day winter transform snow train taget stop stersund total kilomet one day spend five day aboard taget journey time time idl ambl loung dream permit well randomli station map stop night call orsa arsana stersund travel train carriag lani lois warenbourg two french women track northern light abisko lapland stersund board anoth train reach far north feel like outsid time weird see face say melani mask mandatori sweden fredrik olofsson control work line two month give instruct comment humor landscap cross train honk curious random moment pell rkman driver tell warn wild anim car snowmobil arriv barrier except sveg bridg use vehicl cabin proud show black box allow barrier rais lower
"A shopping spree, Mac and Cheese with lobster and a majestic river, all in the heart of Old Montréal","    In the historic heart of Old Montréal, an old library was converted into a hotel. The comfortable Room 101 maintains a connection between the city of yesterday and the city of today. ","Adrienne Couture, founder of Maisons & Co, specializes in transforming historic buildings into contemporary accommodations. Before being converted into an apartment hotel, Maison Sainte-Thérèse, located on rue Sainte-Thérèse in Old Montréal, was the oldest library in the city and the meeting place of the local aristocracy.Even though the renovation project required modernizing a good part of the 19th-century building, the original stone walls, shutters and floor were preserved. By giving this historic building a second life, Ms. Couture has rethought the rules of urban hospitality. Here, there is no bellhop or concierge to welcome guests. Everything is digital. A 24-hour hotline allows guests to contact the virtual concierge as well as the cleaning and maintenance team – and a laundry room is available to guests.On the ground floor, Room 101 (there are only 15 rooms) is the perfect example of the hospitable spirit of this particular house. With posters of old exhibitions by Le Corbusier and Henri Matisse and its furniture, either found or created by Montréal designers, it is one of the eight rooms designed by interior designer Sabrina Barazin. The kitchen is (very well) equipped and the living room has a smart TV connected to various platforms such as Netflix. The night area (without windows, unfortunately) is not huge, but it has a real dressing room and ultra-comfortable bedding. This coziness carries through the whole two-room apartment and more generally the entirety of Maison Sainte-Thérèse.You wouldn't expect to find such a place, somewhere between minimalism and austerity, in this busy neighborhood full of restaurants, cafes and souvenir stores. Ssense is a five-story concept store designed by British architect David Chipperfield. It's associated with an online site of designer pieces that bears the same name. By appointment, one can enjoy a tailored shopping spree within these walls (""magasiner"" as the Québécois say). Or have lunch at the gray, concrete-clad Armani Cafe, located right upstairs.Clément, the manager of Sea Salt, a seafood restaurant located opposite the Old Port, comes from another port city, Marseille, and its chef de salle, Gilles, from Montpellier. The duo has a lot to do with the friendly atmosphere at this eatery, which has a terrace - open as soon as the sun allows it, from spring to the beautiful days of autumn. You can enjoy sweet and iodized oysters that come directly from the neighboring province of Prince Edward Island, spaghetti with seafood or a Mac and Cheese with lobster that makes you forget that you are in the kingdom of poutine.",Travel,adrienne couture founder maisons specializes transforming historic buildings contemporary accommodations converted apartment hotel maison sainte located rue sainte old montr oldest library city meeting place local aristocracy even though renovation project required modernizing good part century building original stone walls shutters floor preserved giving historic building second life couture rethought rules urban hospitality bellhop concierge welcome guests everything digital hour hotline allows guests contact virtual concierge well cleaning maintenance team laundry room available guests ground floor room rooms perfect example hospitable spirit particular house posters old exhibitions corbusier henri matisse furniture either found created montr designers one eight rooms designed interior designer sabrina barazin kitchen well equipped living room smart connected various platforms netflix night area without windows unfortunately huge real dressing room ultra comfortable bedding coziness carries whole two room apartment generally entirety maison sainte wouldnt expect find place somewhere minimalism austerity busy neighborhood full restaurants cafes souvenir stores ssense five story concept store designed british architect david chipperfield associated online site designer pieces bears name appointment one enjoy tailored shopping spree within walls magasiner cois say lunch gray concrete clad armani cafe located right upstairs ment manager sea salt seafood restaurant located opposite old port comes another port city marseille chef salle gilles montpellier duo lot friendly atmosphere eatery terrace open soon sun allows spring beautiful days autumn enjoy sweet iodized oysters come directly neighboring province prince edward island spaghetti seafood mac cheese lobster makes forget kingdom poutine,adrienn coutur founder maison special transform histor build contemporari accommod convert apart hotel maison saint locat rue saint old montr oldest librari citi meet place local aristocraci even though renov project requir modern good part centuri build origin stone wall shutter floor preserv give histor build second life coutur rethought rule urban hospit bellhop concierg welcom guest everyth digit hour hotlin allow guest contact virtual concierg well clean mainten team laundri room avail guest ground floor room room perfect exampl hospit spirit particular hous poster old exhibit corbusi henri matiss furnitur either found creat montr design one eight room design interior design sabrina barazin kitchen well equip live room smart connect variou platform netflix night area without window unfortun huge real dress room ultra comfort bed cozi carri whole two room apart gener entireti maison saint wouldnt expect find place somewher minim auster busi neighborhood full restaur cafe souvenir store ssens five stori concept store design british architect david chipperfield associ onlin site design piec bear name appoint one enjoy tailor shop spree within wall magasin coi say lunch gray concret clad armani cafe locat right upstair ment manag sea salt seafood restaur locat opposit old port come anoth port citi marseil chef sall gill montpelli duo lot friendli atmospher eateri terrac open soon sun allow spring beauti day autumn enjoy sweet iodiz oyster come directli neighbor provinc princ edward island spaghetti seafood mac chees lobster make forget kingdom poutin
Going with the flow in Lugano,Feature,"Lugano is the birthplace of the Eurovision Song Contest. But the first song that comes to mind is not Refrain, the winning song in 1956, the contest's first year, but instead lyrics from the French-Italian singer Nino Ferrer: ""On dirait le Sud. Le temps dure longtemps..."" (""It feels like the south. Time lasts a long time..."") It's true that one would love to stay ""more than a million years"" here. The Swiss town in the Ticino canton, nestled at the foot of the Alps and coiled on the edge of a dazzling lake, provides endless opportunities to lose yourself in the horizon, a majestic natural spectacle which reveals itself in real time.The border with Italy flows through the middle of the northern shore of Lake Lugano. As soon as you leave the scarlet train station, you're met with a festival of color: shades of pink, yellow and blue adorn the baroque or neoclassical facades in this city of nearly 65,000 residents. The city's architecture lends the city a Mediterranean charm, right down to the voices you hear in the  streets. Italian is spoken here: one of the four languages used in Switzerland. The turquoise blue or celadon green of the water, depending on the season, completes the picture.Strolling along the promenade that follows the curve of the lake is the best way to enjoy it. Sheltered by a double row of lime and chestnut trees, dotted with red benches, blue deckchairs and orange pedal boats, the lake invites you to stroll from Ciani Park to Paradiso (and then go back again, as you can never get sick of this view).Ciani Park is the former estate of Giacomo and Filippo Ciani, two Milanese bankers and merchants who settled in Lugano in 1833. Flanked by a salmon-pink villa, it spreads over 63,000 square meters and is the meeting place for Sunday strolls between centuries-old oak and maple trees, providing photo opportunities for tourists passing through.Its beach is very popular for watching the sunset. On the opposite side of the lake, Paradiso is a city in its own right, with 5-star hotels, luxurious apartments and a 50-meter-high water jet inaugurated in 2004 for the International Year of Water.To admire this scenery from above, visitors go up the mountains that embrace the city, both accessible on foot: Monte San Salvatore and Monte Brè. Considered the ""sunniest summit in all of Switzerland,"" Monte Brè rises to 928 meters above sea level and can be reached by taking two funiculars. The first, which you can board on Via Pico, opened in 1908 and is automatic. From the platform, the slope looks very, very steep. At least for those who suffer from vertigo, who are told to focus on their feet, even if the trip only lasts five minutes. Whereas everyone else can admire the panorama as soon as it starts to climb.

French far-right leader seeks to take advantage of AI debate,"    Contrary to his party's conservative position, the president of the Rassemblement National is supporting the creation of European AI champions. ","In an overheated Parisian reception room, before an audience of Members of the European Parliament, writers, and entrepreneurs, a young politician praised artificial intelligence (AI), brushed aside ""the darkest prophecies,"" and, condemning over-regulation, spoke of the urgent need for a European public policy in the sector. Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right party Rassemblement National (RN), has set his sights on artificial intelligence. For the past year, he has emphasized on the importance of ""the other 'great replacement'"", as he calls it in reference to the racist theory which rejects the mixing of populations. Surprisingly, contrasting with the conservative stance in his camp, the young party leader is championing a tech-friendly position.On June 19, Bardella wrapped up a symposium organized in Paris by the Identity & Democracy Foundation (ID), associated with the RN-dominated group in the European Parliament. One of his close friends, the entrepreneur Laurent Alexandre, a passionate advocate of transhumanism – which aims to improve man through technology – and artificial intelligence, was there to deliver opening remarks in the provocative, technophile tone that has made him such a successful writer. One of the voices of French tech, Thomas Fauré, the founder of the ""sovereign collaborative platform"" Whaller, was also present. The rest of the speakers tapped into the European conservative repertoire, which has proved more concerned with the ethical and moral consequences of accelerating AI.For the RN leader, it is both a genuine interest and a political move which speaks more to the upper class than to blue-collar workers. Bardella acknowledged his passion for Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, the best-selling book by Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari, which predicts two possible developments for humanity: In the first, a man empowered by technology; in the second, a takeover of power by specialized AI algorithms.""At 27, he belongs to the digital geek generation. In the political class as a whole, few people are as interested in AI and the future as he is,"" according to Alexandre. Since 2019, the two men have maintained a friendly relationship and regularly have lunch together. The essayist, who supported Macron in 2017 before moving closer to the far right, stressed he was not ""politically aligned with the RN"" although he advocates ""sending illegal immigrants back to Africa by military force"".At an April event organized by the far-right weekly Valeurs Actuelles, Bardella said the ""next great social crisis will arise from ChatGPT [a software capable of sustaining an online conversation],"" urging schools to adapt to a new era rather than ""developing gender studies"".

The people who worry about climate change – but don't want to give up plane travel,"They may be pros at recycling, never forget their tote bag when they go to the supermarket and always buy organic – but the one thing they can't give up are their long-haul flights.","They were among the first to worry about global warming, to rail against SUVs in the city, to buy organic, local-grown vegetables and to be capable of making a 500 meter detour to throw their peelings in the neighborhood composter. But the only habit they haven't managed to kick is air travel. Flight shaming (to make someone else feel guilty for travelling by airplane) hasn't made its mark on them yet. Travel is their ""guilty pleasure,"" they say, the way vegetarians would admit to occasionally lapsing and eating a burger.After all, is it so bad to fly to a European capital for a three-day weekend when you bring your own paper bags and jars to the market to avoid packaging? What can we do if the people who are the most environmentally aware also happen to be travel enthusiasts? They can reel off the list of all the things they've restricted themselves from doing... And just as quickly unroll a string of excuses to justify their next plane trips. Next year, they will fly less, but this year they have children in Erasmus programs to visit. And they are not going to cycle to Palermo for the Ascension holiday!During the Covid-19 pandemic, they enjoyed taking their vacations in France. When they were in Greece for 10 days the next summer, during the time of the fires, they found it incredible that there wasn't more concern about the climate crisis. They have a vague feeling that a rental car only spews out rental CO2. In winter, they find those large advertisements for 39 euro flights environmentally shocking. In spring, they find it economically shocking to have to pay 400-euro round trips. On Instagram, they still post pictures of their vacations, but not those taken from the window of the plane. Who knows, their followers might think they got there by train.""I've been to New York, but because of Covid-19 I hadn't been there in two years."" ""Our daughter almost cancelled her vacation when the IPCC report came out."" ""Still, there are things that you just can't do anymore."" ""If we take stock of our family carbon footprint, my husband hasn't flown in three years."" ""It would really take an act of God to get me to fly to the South of France."" ""I look forward to being banned from doing certain things."" ""Last year, we discovered the Haute-Loire."" ""Their children forced them to go to Poland by bus but we're not quite there yet."" ""Frankfurt, of course, I'd go to by train, but it's not possible for the United States..."" ""Venice, I usually go by sleeper train, but with my mother I fly."" ""You need time to take the train.""

Walking in the Bregenzerwald and its mountains of the future,"    At Austria's western tip, the Bregenzerwald is a haven for hikers and cyclists in the summer and for skiers in the winter. It also serves as a model of mountain agriculture, where traditional know-how is combined with contemporary design. ","Green as far as the eye can see. Shaped lawns reminscent of golf fairways, where not a single blade sticks out. Scattered here and there are cows, placid chewing the cud in abundant meadows. Large wooden chalets, often covered with flowers, dot the landscape, against a backdrop of forested mountains. And when the green disappears, limestone rock dominates, like the Kanisfluh (2,044 meters), the towering cliff in the village of Au, in the south of Bregenzerwald in Austria.There is an air of perfection along the winding roads and paths of this region of the westernmost state of Vorarlberg. It's a harmony of curves and well-kept gardens: The area is known for the way the landscape is cared for, as well as the opulence of its farms. Here, mountain agriculture does not seem to suffer from the same ills as some Alpine or Pyrenean valleys, weakened as a result of isolating and dividing up farms.This area, with its string of 23 villages, inspires peace. It's tempting to get out into the fresh air and walk through the many hilltop hamlets, such as Au, Krumbach or Schwarzenberg. The beauty of alpine pastures here is a powerful incentive for walking. In Bregenzerwald, there are more than 1,500 kilometers of trails marked out, with about 50 routes that can be completed in a day, from easy to strenuous.Less strenuous, but just as spectacular, are the cable cars that climb the peaks. From Schoppernau, head for the Diedamskopf (2,090 m) in order to see the peaks overlooking the region to the south, the Grosser Widderstein (2,533 m), the Hochkünzelspitze (2,397 m), or the Zitterklapfen (2,403 m). Beyond the meadows, these rugged and crevassed mountains blurred by a haze of heat dominate other peaks and glacial valleys, where rare patches of snow remain.Walk with your nose in the air... Or look at your feet and the wild plants that abound. This is naturalist guide Katharina Moosbrugger's specialty. She takes us to the Fohramoos, an extensive peatland area above the village of Schwarzenberg. Behind a pond of brown residual water, a forest made up of both deciduous and coniferous trees covers soft ground. Further on, a clearing shines in the light. Moss and small flowers grow in the spongy soil. Some are edible, others carnivorous, like the round-leaved sundew. ""In the spring, if you stick your ear to the bark of the birch trees, you can hear the water rising in the trunks. If you make a hole, you can even drink it; it's a detox,"" she said.The Bregenzerwald is a land of nature and wide open spaces, and in winter it is a popular destination for skiers. In the summer, it also offers cyclists and mountain bikers somewhere to indulge their passion, between pass roads, valley trails and great paths. A good reason to abandon the car. Especially since the Bregenzerwald guest card, issued from May to October to all guests staying at least three nights in a hotel, gives free access to public transport.

"In Giverny, soothing guest rooms, secret art studios and a beautiful sea of flowers",Selection,"David Gallienne became famous afters his victory on Top Chef in 2020. That same year, the Normandy native took the helm of the Jardin des Plumes, the gastronomic hotel-restaurant in Giverny, where he has managed to keep hold of its Michelin star. Located less than 80 kilometers from Paris, the Eure village beloved by Monet attracts tourists from all over the world. More and more city dwellers looking for a breath of country air have been coming there too, and the large half-timbered building can no longer accommodate all of the visitors who want to stay there.So the chef opened O Plum'Art. These five guest rooms and an apartment are in the former early 20th century home of a milkman, a perfect base to start your visit from. As a tribute to its former resident, the interior is painted the color of milk from floor to ceiling, making the place very soothing. As in the main establishment, the rooms are named after species of chickens, a nod to the birds that peck around the grounds.The Marans apartment is an elegant, immaculate cocoon at the back of the house, on the garden level. Vintage wooden furniture, a bouquet of dried flowers and old books warm the living room overlooking the large lawn. In the bedroom, the bed is on a platform facing a print of Monet's Water Lilies on a television screen on standby – a cliché that makes you smile. The breakfast served on the first floor, near the fireplace, is also something of a good cliché, tasty and comforting: the fallue (Norman brioche) and the bourdelot (local apple turnover), offered with honey from the village and jams prepared by Mr. Gallienne's mother.At the small cemetery located in the yard of the Sainte-Radegonde Church, visitors stroll about, bent over and peering, looking for the grave of Claude Monet, who died in 1926 at the age of 86. The grave is at the back of the Romanesque building, on the right side when looking from the street. You have to keep your eyes open to find it, because earth and flower petals cover the name of the Impressionist master engraved on the tombstone. 53-55, Rue Claude-Monet. Free walk.The Hotel Baudy was the headquarters of the Impressionists. Painters Theodore Robinson, Camille Pissarro and Theodore Earl Butler stayed there, as did Paul Cézanne. To allow their guests to work on rainy days, the owners built a studio under a glass roof in the garden. The place is still in its original state, with an easel and different kinds of paintbrushes. To get there, you have to walk across the old-fashioned Great Room of the hotel toward the garden. 81 Rue Claude-Monet.

"Harry Potter's bedroom, the Hobbit's house... The flourishing niche market of French 'fantasy' tourism",    Why not sleep like Princess Leia in an intergalactic spaceship room near La Rochelle or an apartment decorated like 'Game of Thrones' in Colmar? Tourist experiences inspired by fictional universes are all the rage in France. ,"No detail is ignored in the ""sorcerer's cottage,"" which is available on Airbnb for about 100 euros per night. Visitors are greeted by the scent of caramel, which is supposed to evoke the smell of butterbeer, before discovering a candlelit room, with stone walls covered with a tapestry and a four-poster bed decorated with pennants in the colors of Hogwarts's four houses. A wooden wand sits in the corner, next to a small metal cage with a stuffed owl on it. Hundreds of ""Potterheads,"" fans of the young wizard, who visit Colmar, enjoy the references to the universe of J. K. Rowling's saga, including the books of spells on a shelf in the bathroom. In the comments on the Airbnb website, Sébastien praised ""a break away from the muggles,"" and Olivier said that ""watching a Harry Potter movie in this environment is an incredible experience.""The only catch: in order to spend a weekend in this Harry Potter-inspired room, you now have to book months in advance. Manuella Schaupp, 31, created this detailed décor in 2020, in a secluded room in her large house. It was so successful that other hosts contacted her to learn her style secrets. It has since become her profession: after studying applied arts, Ms. Schaupp opened a set design company dedicated to the tourism of the imaginary. Her latest mission? To design an Avatar-themed lodge in Belfort. ""I've always been passionate about theme parks, I love this very American culture of making people dream with immersive settings. We don't have this trend here yet, but it seems that people are eager to try it,"" said the decorator. According to her, dozens of marriage proposals have already taken place in the ""wizard's lodge.""Airbnb is happy to encourage this flourishing niche market. When contacted by email, the Californian company pointed out that the ""hosts of unique accommodations have collectively earned more than 300 million dollar worldwide between the start of the pandemic and June 2021. In France, this figure amounts to more than 15 million euros."" The firm goes as far as surfing on the trend by itself offering pop-up housing related to cultural news, in partnership with production companies. To celebrate the 95th birthday of Winnie the Pooh, it is offering a stay in an adorable cottage in the English countryside. And to mark the release of the series And Just Like That, the sequel to Sex & The City on HBO, a New York apartment decorated in the style of Carrie Bradshaw has appeared on Airbnb.Isabelle Zemb, 42, a caregiver in Nancy, in the northeast of France, challenged herself to visit all the atypical housing in her area. ""I work in an end-of-life unit, which is not the most cheerful thing, especially during Covid. When I go away for the weekend, it's to completely disconnect from everyday life, to feel like I'm in a movie. It's a great way to unwind,"" said Isabelle, who has already stayed at the Jurassic apartment in Metz, the Hobbit house in the Vosges and, most recently, the Game of Thrones-style apartment in Colmar. She and her sister spent the evening wearing dresses and fake furs, taking pictures of themselves ""like medieval queens"" on the iron throne installed in the room, before heading back to Nancy in the car.

48 hours in Bologna,"    Whether you are taking a stroll under its porticoes, sipping a glass of Chianti wine in an osteria or climbing to the top of the medieval Asinelli tower, this Italian city invites you to get lost in its red-hued streets. ","La dotta, la grassa, la rossa: ""the Learn'd,"" ""the Fat"" and ""the Red."" It's clear where the Italian city of Bologna got its nicknames. The city is home to Europe's oldest university (""la dotta""), the streets are made of red bricks (""la rossa"" – plus, it has long been a stronghold of the Italian Communist Party) and it's known for its gastronomy (""la grassa""), particularly its ground beef sauce that goes with tagliatelle – just be careful not to call it ""spag bol.""7:30 a.m. A stroll and the goliardiIn an Italian city, you should always start your day with a stroll along the streets, with no other goal than to take in the beauty of the façades or greet an elderly man drinking his ristretto coffee while reading a newspaper. The orange walls reflect the first rays of sunshine. Bologna is a ""red city,"" built of bricks made with locally-available clay.Once introductions are made, you can indulge in a macchiato, a cream-filled croissant and a freshly-squeezed fruit juice in the square of the Porta San Donato, an ancient gate (1) located in the middle of the university district. Take a look: There are two goliardi! These students, dressed in long capes and front-pointed hats, belong to a brotherhood created to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the University of Bologna in 1888.9:45 a.m. Medieval ManhattanPigeons, tourists, musicians and jugglers mingle here. Between the town hall, the imposing Basilica of San Petronio and other prestigious palazzi, Piazza Maggiore (2) is the city’s nerve center, even if its construction dates ""only"" from the beginning of the 13th century.To better take in the urban landscape, walk up the long ramp (designed so that horses could go up it) located in the city hall on one side of the square. From there, you can access the small terrace that surrounds the clock tower.This is one of the few remaining tall brick towers that Bolognese noble families built to store grain, monitor the surrounding area and, above all, celebrate their power. In the Middle Ages, there were over 100 towers, as you can see in a wooden scale model in the city museum, located in the same building. A real ""medieval Manhattan.""11:00 a.m. The pope and the BasilicaAt that time, Bologna already had its own university. The institution made its mark on history, so much so that it provoked a sly rivalry between the political powers-that-be and the papal authorities. The Archiginnasio Palace (3), intended for teaching, was built in the 16th century right next to the Basilica of San Petronio by order of the pope. The Pontiff wanted to physically prevent the Bologna authorities from extending the nave of the church, which risked outdoing St. Peter's in Rome.",Travel,dotta grassa rossa learnd fat red clear italian city bologna got nicknames city home europes oldest university dotta streets made red bricks rossa plus long stronghold italian communist party known gastronomy grassa particularly ground beef sauce goes tagliatelle careful call spag bol stroll goliardiin italian city always start day stroll along streets goal take beauty ades greet elderly man drinking ristretto coffee reading newspaper orange walls reflect first rays sunshine bologna red city built bricks made locally available clay introductions made indulge macchiato cream filled croissant freshly squeezed fruit juice square porta san donato ancient gate located middle university district take look two goliardi students dressed long capes front pointed hats belong brotherhood created celebrate anniversary university bologna medieval manhattanpigeons tourists musicians jugglers mingle town hall imposing basilica san petronio prestigious palazzi piazza maggiore city nerve center even construction dates beginning century better take urban landscape walk long ramp designed horses could located city hall one side square access small terrace surrounds clock tower one remaining tall brick towers bolognese noble families built store grain monitor surrounding area celebrate power middle ages towers see wooden scale model city museum located building real medieval manhattan pope basilicaat time bologna already university institution made mark history much provoked sly rivalry political powers papal authorities archiginnasio palace intended teaching built century right next basilica san petronio order pope pontiff wanted physically prevent bologna authorities extending nave church risked outdoing peters rome,dotta grassa rossa learnd fat red clear italian citi bologna got nicknam citi home europ oldest univers dotta street made red brick rossa plu long stronghold italian communist parti known gastronomi grassa particularli ground beef sauc goe tagliatel care call spag bol stroll goliardiin italian citi alway start day stroll along street goal take beauti ade greet elderli man drink ristretto coffe read newspap orang wall reflect first ray sunshin bologna red citi built brick made local avail clay introduct made indulg macchiato cream fill croissant freshli squeez fruit juic squar porta san donato ancient gate locat middl univers district take look two goliardi student dress long cape front point hat belong brotherhood creat celebr anniversari univers bologna mediev manhattanpigeon tourist musician juggler mingl town hall impos basilica san petronio prestigi palazzi piazza maggior citi nerv center even construct date begin centuri better take urban landscap walk long ramp design hors could locat citi hall one side squar access small terrac surround clock tower one remain tall brick tower bolognes nobl famili built store grain monitor surround area celebr power middl age tower see wooden scale model citi museum locat build real mediev manhattan pope basilicaat time bologna alreadi univers institut made mark histori much provok sli rivalri polit power papal author archiginnasio palac intend teach built centuri right next basilica san petronio order pope pontiff want physic prevent bologna author extend nave church risk outdo peter rome
"Madeira, a place of perpetual spring",Selection,"The big resorts with swimming pools and prestigious hotels (Belmond Reid's Palace, where Churchill stayed, Pestana Casino Park, designed by Niemeyer) are traditionally located on the cliff. ""Cajú, Le Petit Hôtel,"" on the other hand, is located in the heart of old Funchal, with its memorable charm. In a century-old house, which was renovated just before the pandemic, the Madeiran designer Nini Andrade Silva has played with shades of gray by boldly using raw concrete and by preserving the building's stone, which is visible in the rooms.In the corridors of this 24-room establishment with excellent bedding, pipes and technical ducts are reminiscent of the Pompidou Musuem in Paris. Room 107 is compact but has a high-ceiling and a long balcony where you can sit at any time and enjoy the mild local air because ""Madeira is an island that is rather like Eden. It is never cold or too hot, and the ocean that bathes it is never raging,"" said Jacques Chardonne in Vivre à Madère (""Living in Madeira""), his novel published in 1953.Constrained by the shapes of the local architecture, the Cajú hotel does not really offer an intermediary space between the rooms and the street. Fortunately, because it is ideally located, it invites you to take many walks in this port and island city with wide avenues planted with jacaranda trees and small streets that evoke the bairro alto of Lisbon before excessive tourism. Somewhere between old Europe and the New World, between our temperate latitudes and the tropics, an air of perpetual holidays envelops Funchal.This garden is like an introduction to the hikes on the island, which prides itself on the extraordinary diversity of its flora. Palm trees and dragon trees rub shoulders with the kapok tree (the cotton tree with its high-up white balls), the coral tree with scarlet flowers and the beaucarnea, whose trunk base looks like an elephant's foot. Water jets and flowers in majesty, such as the orange and blue birds of paradise (Strelitzia reginae), contribute to its charm.

Chinese airlines buy 292 Airbus planes for $37 billion,"    Chinese airlines have struck a deal to buy 292 Airbus aircraft for $37 billion, a boost for the aviation sector giant as Chinese travel restrictions ease ","Four Chinese airlines said Friday, July 1, they will buy a total of 292 planes from Airbus in a $37 billion windfall for the aviation giant, as the industry rebuilds after the coronavirus pandemic. The orders come after a bumper year for Airbus, which posted record profits in 2021 after a two-year pandemic slump, giving the company a further boost over US rival Boeing.China Eastern said Friday it had agreed to purchase 100 A320neo jets and China Southern said on the same day that it would buy 96 of the same model. Air China and its subsidiary Shenzhen Airlines also confirmed the purchase of a combined 96 A320neo planes, according to separate filings.Airbus said in a statement Friday that the deals showed ""the positive recovery momentum and prosperous outlook for the Chinese aviation market."" It said the deals ""brought to conclusion these long and extensive discussions that have taken place throughout the difficult Covid pandemic.""Boeing's business in China − one of the world's largest aviation markets − was hit in recent years by uncertainty over its 737 MAX planes, which were suspended from use in the country after deadly crashes in 2019. Chinese authorities finally gave the go-ahead for the 737 MAX to resume service last year after making a series of safety adjustments.In March this year, a Boeing 737-800 crashed in the southern province of Guangxi, killing 132 people in China's worst air disaster in decades.China's travel industry has been hammered by the country's stringent zero-Covid policy, which has imposed sweeping lockdowns often over just a handful of cases and weighed on the economy and consumer confidence.The country's international borders were shut in March 2020 and the number of international flights is still tightly restricted in an effort to tamp down ""imported"" virus cases. But there were hopes of some relaxation in the policy this week after Beijing said it would cut the length of mandatory quarantine for inbound travelers − the biggest easing of entry restrictions yet after sticking to a rigid zero-Covid policy throughout the pandemic.Air China on Friday said its latest purchase would ""optimize fleet structure and supplement capacity in the long term."" China also has high hopes for developing its own aircraft manufacturing industry, with attention focused on Comac's C919 narrow-body plane, a potential rival to Airbus and Boeing aircraft.",Travel,four chinese airlines said friday july buy total planes airbus billion windfall aviation giant industry rebuilds coronavirus pandemic orders come bumper year airbus posted record profits two year pandemic slump giving company boost rival boeing china eastern said friday agreed purchase neo jets china southern said day would buy model air china subsidiary shenzhen airlines also confirmed purchase combined neo planes according separate filings airbus said statement friday deals showed positive recovery momentum prosperous outlook chinese aviation market said deals brought conclusion long extensive discussions taken place throughout difficult covid pandemic boeings business china one worlds largest aviation markets hit recent years uncertainty max planes suspended use country deadly crashes chinese authorities finally gave ahead max resume service last year making series safety adjustments march year boeing crashed southern province guangxi killing people chinas worst air disaster decades chinas travel industry hammered countrys stringent zero covid policy imposed sweeping lockdowns often handful cases weighed economy consumer confidence countrys international borders shut march number international flights still tightly restricted effort tamp imported virus cases hopes relaxation policy week beijing said would cut length mandatory quarantine inbound travelers biggest easing entry restrictions yet sticking rigid zero covid policy throughout pandemic air china friday said latest purchase would optimize fleet structure supplement capacity long term china also high hopes developing aircraft manufacturing industry attention focused comacs narrow body plane potential rival airbus boeing aircraft,four chines airlin said friday juli buy total plane airbu billion windfal aviat giant industri rebuild coronaviru pandem order come bumper year airbu post record profit two year pandem slump give compani boost rival boe china eastern said friday agre purchas neo jet china southern said day would buy model air china subsidiari shenzhen airlin also confirm purchas combin neo plane accord separ file airbu said statement friday deal show posit recoveri momentum prosper outlook chines aviat market said deal brought conclus long extens discuss taken place throughout difficult covid pandem boe busi china one world largest aviat market hit recent year uncertainti max plane suspend use countri deadli crash chines author final gave ahead max resum servic last year make seri safeti adjust march year boe crash southern provinc guangxi kill peopl china worst air disast decad china travel industri hammer countri stringent zero covid polici impos sweep lockdown often hand case weigh economi consum confid countri intern border shut march number intern flight still tightli restrict effort tamp import viru case hope relax polici week beij said would cut length mandatori quarantin inbound travel biggest eas entri restrict yet stick rigid zero covid polici throughout pandem air china friday said latest purchas would optim fleet structur supplement capac long term china also high hope develop aircraft manufactur industri attent focus comac narrow bodi plane potenti rival airbu boe aircraft
City of Paris museums announce new season focusing on female artists,"    The 14 institutions, which attracted more visitors in 2021-2022 than before the pandemic, have announced a new season focused on female creators. ","""The City of Paris museums are doing well!"" It is with this more than positive assessment that Carine Rolland, deputy mayor of Paris in charge of culture, celebrated the success of the 2021-2022 season that is coming to an end. After two years affected by the pandemic and restricted cultural life, the exhibitions and collections of the 14 Parisian museums attracted more than 2.2 million visitors in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, visitor numbers even exceeded those of the same period in 2019. This achievement can be explained by exhibits that are ""demanding, ambitious and accessible to all,"" said Carine Rolland.Paris Musées is not content to rest on its laurels, however. For its 2022-2023 program, which will begin in September, the capital's museums have decided to pay tribute to female creators – visual artists, photographers and actresses – through exhibitions on a variety of themes. ""We want to give them visibility because they are above all great artists, some of them forgotten,"" said Ms. Rolland. ""Paris Musées wants to participate in this women's emancipation movement that is currently taking place in our society.""The Musée de la Vie Romantique has already begun this with its temporary exhibition ""Héroïnes Romantiques,"" which began on April 6 and will end on September 4. To continue this theme, between April and September 2023, the museum will invite the French visual artist Françoise Pétrovitch, little known to the general public, to display her work throughout the institution. From the house to the workshops and garden, the museum will offer a journey around the artist's paintings, sculptures and drawings. ""What remains of romanticism in contemporary art today?"" asked Gaëlle Rio, the director. Two themes will be honored: nature and the feeling of love communicated by a couple's unspoken words and uncertainties. Several pieces will be created for the occasion and displayed to the public for the first time.At the Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris, the focus on female creators will be twofold. Starting on March 31 and running through July 16, 2023, the museum will host a retrospective dedicated to the Franco-Norwegian painter Anna-Eva Bergman. ""There is a kind of secrecy around her work because she is a woman,"" said Fabrice Hergott, the director. ""Today, her talent begs to be reconsidered."" While the museum had already celebrated her in 1977, this artist, a key figure in post-war painting, is back in the rooms devoted to major historical exhibitions, with over 200 works (paintings, graphic arts, manuscripts and archives). In collaboration with the Fondation Hartung-Bergman, the exhibition will shed light on her work, which is characterized by a pictorial language inspired by Nordic landscapes and mythologies.",Travel,city paris museums well positive assessment carine rolland deputy mayor paris charge culture celebrated success season coming end two years affected pandemic restricted cultural life exhibitions collections parisian museums attracted million visitors first quarter visitor numbers even exceeded period achievement explained exhibits demanding ambitious accessible said carine rolland paris mus content rest laurels however program begin september capitals museums decided pay tribute female creators visual artists photographers actresses exhibitions variety themes want give visibility great artists forgotten said rolland paris mus wants participate womens emancipation movement currently taking place society mus vie romantique already begun temporary exhibition nes romantiques began april end september continue theme april september museum invite french visual artist fran oise trovitch little known general public display work throughout institution house workshops garden museum offer journey around artists paintings sculptures drawings remains romanticism contemporary art today asked lle rio director two themes honored nature feeling love communicated couples unspoken words uncertainties several pieces created occasion displayed public first time mus dart moderne paris focus female creators twofold starting march running july museum host retrospective dedicated franco norwegian painter anna eva bergman kind secrecy around work woman said fabrice hergott director today talent begs reconsidered museum already celebrated artist key figure post war painting back rooms devoted major historical exhibitions works paintings graphic arts manuscripts archives collaboration fondation hartung bergman exhibition shed light work characterized language inspired nordic landscapes mythologies,citi pari museum well posit assess carin rolland deputi mayor pari charg cultur celebr success season come end two year affect pandem restrict cultur life exhibit collect parisian museum attract million visitor first quarter visitor number even exceed period achiev explain exhibit demand ambiti access said carin rolland pari mu content rest laurel howev program begin septemb capit museum decid pay tribut femal creator visual artist photograph actress exhibit varieti theme want give visibl great artist forgotten said rolland pari mu want particip women emancip movement current take place societi mu vie romantiqu alreadi begun temporari exhibit ne romantiqu began april end septemb continu theme april septemb museum invit french visual artist fran ois trovitch littl known gener public display work throughout institut hous workshop garden museum offer journey around artist paint sculptur draw remain romantic contemporari art today ask lle rio director two theme honor natur feel love commun coupl unspoken word uncertainti sever piec creat occas display public first time mu dart modern pari focu femal creator twofold start march run juli museum host retrospect dedic franco norwegian painter anna eva bergman kind secreci around work woman said fabric hergott director today talent beg reconsid museum alreadi celebr artist key figur post war paint back room devot major histor exhibit work paint graphic art manuscript archiv collabor fondat hartung bergman exhibit shed light work character languag inspir nordic landscap mytholog
Dive into the Grands Crus: Five vineyards where visitors can also spend the night,"    'Le Monde' invites you to travel. This week, a review of five estates where you can relax after your wine tasting, from Bordeaux to Provence, through the Loire Valley, Burgundy and Champagne. ","Discovering exceptional wines and champagnes without having to hit the road again, while treating yourself to a spa, an immersive experience, a local menu – it's possible again, and also affordable. For a change of scenery while pleasing your palate, and much more, follow the guide!Les Sources de Caudalie is the absolute stalwart in wine tourism in the Bordeaux region, and a pioneer, too. The place boasts impressive assets: Only 15 kilometers south of Bordeaux, it's nestled in the vineyards of Château Smith Haut Lafitte, an icon of Pessac-Léognan wines. This authentic hamlet with traditional Aquitaine architecture houses three restaurants and a spa (with the famous Caudalie treatments made from grape extracts). The estate also offers the possibility of bike rides in the vineyard or in the 8-hectare forest next to it, dotted with land art. You can drink the estate's wines and eat the vegetables from the garden. From swimming pools to cooking classes to the château's barrel-making facility to boat trips, it's impossible to get bored.The idea is certainly absurd. But with a small dose of humor and a laid-back attitude, it has its charm: Put yourself in a grape's shoes and spend the night sleeping in a barrel on a wine estate. No maceration or fermentation on the schedule, but just country comfort with a camping theme. (You can either bring your own comforter or rent a sleeping kit.)The concept was thought up  by the federation of independent winegrowers of the Pays de la Loire. And it was put into practice here, 15 minutes from Nantes, in the town of Thouaré-sur-Loire (western France) on the river. The small 3.5-hectare vineyard produces three vintages, two whites (Muscadet and Coteaux d'Ancenis) and a light red, as well as sparkling grape juice. The Marchais estate also owns surrounding vineyards and offers many other vintages for tasting.Burgundian winemakers are sometimes criticized for keeping their doors closed. Jean-Louis Trapet, one of the most respected winemakers of Gevrey-Chambertin (and even of the whole Côte de Nuits), has therefore decided to set up a guest house.",Travel,discovering exceptional wines champagnes without hit road treating spa immersive experience local menu possible also affordable change scenery pleasing palate much follow guide les sources caudalie absolute stalwart wine tourism bordeaux region pioneer place boasts impressive assets kilometers south bordeaux nestled vineyards teau smith haut lafitte icon pessac ognan wines authentic hamlet traditional aquitaine architecture houses three restaurants spa famous caudalie treatments made grape extracts estate also offers possibility bike rides vineyard hectare forest next dotted land art drink estates wines eat vegetables garden swimming pools cooking classes teaus barrel making facility boat trips impossible get bored idea certainly absurd small dose humor laid back attitude charm put grapes shoes spend night sleeping barrel wine estate maceration fermentation schedule country comfort camping theme either bring comforter rent sleeping kit concept thought federation independent winegrowers pays loire put practice minutes nantes town thouar sur loire western france river small hectare vineyard produces three vintages two whites muscadet coteaux dancenis light red well sparkling grape juice marchais estate also owns surrounding vineyards offers many vintages tasting burgundian winemakers sometimes criticized keeping doors closed jean louis trapet one respected winemakers gevrey chambertin even whole nuits therefore decided set guest house,discov except wine champagn without hit road treat spa immers experi local menu possibl also afford chang sceneri pleas palat much follow guid le sourc caudali absolut stalwart wine tourism bordeaux region pioneer place boast impress asset kilomet south bordeaux nestl vineyard teau smith haut lafitt icon pessac ognan wine authent hamlet tradit aquitain architectur hous three restaur spa famou caudali treatment made grape extract estat also offer possibl bike ride vineyard hectar forest next dot land art drink estat wine eat veget garden swim pool cook class teau barrel make facil boat trip imposs get bore idea certainli absurd small dose humor laid back attitud charm put grape shoe spend night sleep barrel wine estat macer ferment schedul countri comfort camp theme either bring comfort rent sleep kit concept thought feder independ winegrow pay loir put practic minut nant town thouar sur loir western franc river small hectar vineyard produc three vintag two white muscadet coteaux danceni light red well sparkl grape juic marchai estat also own surround vineyard offer mani vintag tast burgundian winemak sometim critic keep door close jean loui trapet one respect winemak gevrey chambertin even whole nuit therefor decid set guest hous
"José Sébéloué, tender voice of 80's French band La Compagnie Créole, has died","    The singer from French Guiana, co-founder of the festive hit band, died in Paris on Sunday, aged 74. ","It is still hard to find a wedding or birthday party in France where José Sébéloué's voice does not resonate. Along with Clémence Bringtown, he was the lead singer, and guitarist, of La Compagnie Créole, the band behind a series of hits (""Vive le douanier Rousseau,"" ""C'est bon pour le moral,"" ""Le Bal masqué,"" ""Ça fait rire les oiseaux"") that have been an undeniable part of the country's collective memory since the 1980s. Sébéloué, 74, died in Paris on Sunday, September 3.Born on September 17, 1948, in Ouanary, French Guiana, Sébéloué began his musical career with a local band, Pop-Corn, before founding La Compagnie Créole in 1975 with Bringtown, Julien Tarquin, Guy Bevert and Arthur Apatout, musicians from the Martinique and Guadeloupe regions he had met in Paris. The crew adapted traditional tunes from the West Indian repertoire in a unique way until they crossed paths with Parisian Daniel Vangarde and Belgium's Jean Kluger in the early 1980s.At the time, the pair made a name for itself in the Latin disco vein, signing hits with musicians from the Martinique (Gibson Brothers) and Guadeloupe (the Ottawan duo). A passionate fan of tropical music, Vangarde – the father of Daft Punk co-founder Thomas Bangalter – first produced an album of traditional biguine songs for La Compagnie, Blogodo (1982), all sung in Creole.Success came a year later when, between sessions with disco star Amii Stewart, the Franco-Belgian producer's duo got the band to record a version of ""C'est bon pour le moral,"" a song by Vangarde that had not found any takers. Before literally triumphing – thanks in particular to its airing on French television – the disco zouk color given by the musicians initially struggled to seduce radio stations. ""Roger Kreicher, RTL's program director, had told me contemptuously: 'This is ballroom music,'"" Vangarde recalled in an interview with Le Monde last year, adding he had answered back: ""You couldn't please me more.""""The song had a bit of trouble getting off the ground,"" Kluger later said. ""The band then started working on a new single, 'Vive le Douanier Rousseau' when they were selected to represent France at Eurovision in 1983."" La Compagnie Créole came second in the contest, enabling the band to continue working on ""C'est bon pour le moral,"" which eventually made its way onto the airwaves. It was soon followed by ""Vive le douanier Rousseau,"" ""Le Bal masqué,"" ""Ça fait rire les oiseaux,"" and ""Bons baisers de Fort-de-France,"" all of which benefited from late business magnate Francis Bouygues' passion for the band. In his position as owner of French television TF1, he managed to have the musicians appear 36 times on ""Sacrée Soirée,"" an emblematic Saturday evening show in France in the 1980s.",Obituaries,still hard find wedding birthday party france jos lou voice resonate along mence bringtown lead singer guitarist compagnie ole band behind series hits vive douanier rousseau cest bon pour moral bal masqu fait rire les oiseaux undeniable part countrys collective memory since lou died paris sunday september born september ouanary french guiana lou began musical career local band pop corn founding compagnie ole bringtown julien tarquin guy bevert arthur apatout musicians martinique guadeloupe regions met paris crew adapted traditional tunes west indian repertoire unique way crossed paths parisian daniel vangarde belgiums jean kluger early time pair made name latin disco vein signing hits musicians martinique gibson brothers guadeloupe ottawan duo passionate fan tro music vangarde father daft punk founder thomas bangalter first produced album traditional biguine songs compagnie blogodo sung creole success came year later sessions disco star amii stewart franco belgian producers duo got band record version cest bon pour moral song vangarde found takers literally triumphing thanks particular airing french television disco zouk color given musicians initially struggled seduce radio stations roger kreicher rtls program director told contemptuously ballroom music vangarde recalled interview monde last year adding answered back couldnt please song bit trouble getting ground kluger later said band started working new single vive douanier rousseau selected represent france eurovision compagnie ole came second contest enabling band continue working cest bon pour moral eventually made way onto airwaves soon followed vive douanier rousseau bal masqu fait rire les oiseaux bons baisers fort france benefited late business magnate francis bouygues passion band position owner french television managed musicians appear times sacr soir emblematic saturday evening show france,still hard find wed birthday parti franc jo lou voic reson along menc bringtown lead singer guitarist compagni ole band behind seri hit vive douanier rousseau cest bon pour moral bal masqu fait rire le oiseaux undeni part countri collect memori sinc lou die pari sunday septemb born septemb ouanari french guiana lou began music career local band pop corn found compagni ole bringtown julien tarquin guy bevert arthur apatout musician martiniqu guadeloup region met pari crew adapt tradit tune west indian repertoir uniqu way cross path parisian daniel vangard belgium jean kluger earli time pair made name latin disco vein sign hit musician martiniqu gibson brother guadeloup ottawan duo passion fan tro music vangard father daft punk founder thoma bangalt first produc album tradit biguin song compagni blogodo sung creol success came year later session disco star amii stewart franco belgian produc duo got band record version cest bon pour moral song vangard found taker liter triumph thank particular air french televis disco zouk color given musician initi struggl seduc radio station roger kreicher rtl program director told contemptu ballroom music vangard recal interview mond last year ad answer back couldnt pleas song bit troubl get ground kluger later said band start work new singl vive douanier rousseau select repres franc eurovis compagni ole came second contest enabl band continu work cest bon pour moral eventu made way onto airwav soon follow vive douanier rousseau bal masqu fait rire le oiseaux bon baiser fort franc benefit late busi magnat franci bouygu passion band posit owner french televis manag musician appear time sacr soir emblemat saturday even show franc
"Dominique Colonna, former France goalkeeper, dies aged 95",    The Corsican who played for Stade de Reims was one of last surviving members of France's squad at the 1958 World Cup. ,"Dominique Colonna, one of the last surviving members of the France squad that reached the semi-finals of the 1958 World Cup, has died aged 95, his former club Stade de Reims announced on Tuesday, September 12.Colonna won 13 caps for France, making his debut against Iceland in 1957 and his final appearance against Spain four years later. In the middle of that span he travelled to Sweden with a France team that boasted the legendary Just Fontaine who scored 13 goals, still a record for a single World Cup tournament.Colonna, however, who was unusually short for a goalkeeper at 1.72 metres did not play a single game at the tournament as Claude Abbes was first choice. With Colonna's death, Robert Mouynet and Bernard Chiarelli remain the only living members of that squad.Born in 1928, Colonna grew up in Corte in Corsica before joining Nice on the French mainland and played six seasons at Reims between 1957-1963, winning the French top flight three times. He was also between the posts for Reims during their 2-0 European Cup final defeat to Real Madrid back in 1959, saving a penalty from Madrid legend Alfredo di Stefano.""He was as intrepid on the pitch as he was charming and witty off it,"" Reims president Jean-Pierre Caillot said. ""He made up for his modest height with his astonishing reflexes and his nerves of steel, in a way he inspired the following generations,"" he said.After hanging up his own boots he became the first coach of newly-independent Cameroon in 1963.",Obituaries,dominique colonna one last surviving members france squad reached semi finals world cup died aged former club stade reims announced tuesday september colonna caps france making debut iceland final appearance spain four years later middle span travelled sweden france team boasted legendary fontaine scored goals still record single world cup tournament colonna however unusually short goalkeeper metres play single game tournament claude abbes first choice colonnas death robert mouynet bernard chiarelli remain living members squad born colonna grew corte corsica joining nice french mainland played six seasons reims winning french top flight three times also posts reims european cup final defeat real madrid back saving penalty madrid legend alfredo stefano intrepid pitch charming witty reims president jean pierre caillot said made modest height astonishing reflexes nerves steel way inspired following generations said hanging boots became first coach newly independent cameroon,dominiqu colonna one last surviv member franc squad reach semi final world cup die age former club stade reim announc tuesday septemb colonna cap franc make debut iceland final appear spain four year later middl span travel sweden franc team boast legendari fontain score goal still record singl world cup tournament colonna howev unusu short goalkeep metr play singl game tournament claud abb first choic colonna death robert mouynet bernard chiarelli remain live member squad born colonna grew cort corsica join nice french mainland play six season reim win french top flight three time also post reim european cup final defeat real madrid back save penalti madrid legend alfredo stefano intrepid pitch charm witti reim presid jean pierr caillot said made modest height astonish reflex nerv steel way inspir follow gener said hang boot becam first coach newli independ cameroon
"The death of Giorgio Napolitano, former communist and Italian president","    The tireless activist who started off as a communist and played a leading role in the life of Italian politics died on September 22 at the age of 98. A symbol of stability and political longevity, he remained president for nine years. ","Giorgio Napolitano, the 11th president of the Italian Republic from 15 May 2006 to 14 January 2015, born on 29 June 1925 in Naples, died on September 22, 2023. He was 98 years old. From the heights of the Quirinal, the seat of the presidency, he dominated both the city of Rome and the country's political life. He accompanied, and sometimes led, its transformations as five presidents of the Council succeeded each other in the Chigi Palace, the seat of the presidency of the Council: Romano Prodi (2006-2008), Silvio Berlusconi (2008-2011), Mario Monti (2011-2013), Enrico Letta (2013-2014) and Matteo Renzi (2014-2016).He managed to turn an institutional mandate with a more symbolic than real power into a moral magisterium at a time when the financial crisis that began in 2008 and Silvio Berlusconi's sexual escapades were threatening to ruin Italy's reputation for good.A man with an old-fashioned and sometimes pompous language, an intellectual respected by his peers, a theater and literature lover, he became close to Neapolitan communist circles in his youth after briefly flirting with fascist-inspired movements. Once peace returned, he joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and became its national secretary for the provinces of Naples and Salerno. After graduating in law and writing a thesis on the Mezzogiorno's ""lack of industrial development,"" he was elected MP for the first time in 1953, a mandate he would keep until 1996.At the same time, he climbed the ranks of the PCI, then led by Palmiro Togliatti, and joined its central committee in 1956. Perfectly in line with the party, he supported the Soviet intervention in Hungary, which, according to him, had not only ""saved the country from chaos but contributed to world peace."" ""My story,"" he explained in 2009, ""has gone through decisive changes due to the international and national reality and through profound and assumed personal revisions.""This metamorphosis led him to seek points of convergence with the Socialist Party. The death of Togliatti in 1964, while he was spending his vacations in Crimea was a chance for Napolitano to free himself from his tutelage and to make his membership to the PCI's moderate wing public. Luigi Longo, who became secretary-general, made him his number two. But it was his role as the man responsible for the PCI's cultural policy between 1969 and 1975 that gradually gave him the visibility he needed to assert himself.As party spokesman, he was also in charge of relations with the Andreotti government between 1976 and 1979. A reformist Communist capable of dialogue with the leaders of the Christian Democracy as well as with the trade unions and a convinced European, he took part in numerous international congresses in Europe and forged ties with left-wing leaders like Willy Brandt in Germany. In 1978, he became the first member of the PCI to receive a travel visa for the United States.Having become an assertive social democrat, he sided with the ""migliorists"" communists who sought to improve the working class's lot without bringing down capitalism. He condemned the Soviet Union's intervention in Afghanistan. In contrast with then PCI secretary general Enrico Berlinguer, who was wary of opening up to the Socialist Party, Napolitano maintained his reformist line and warned against the risk of ""isolation"" and ""sectarianism.""As head of the foreign policy committee, he pushed the party to declare itself in favor of ""total loyalty"" to the United States and NATO. He also led it to nuance its almost automatic support for the Palestinian cause. It was around this time that Henry Kissinger said of him: ""He is my favorite communist!"" His transformation ended in 1984 with the death of Berlinguer. Unable to succeed him, he gradually relinquished his responsibilities within the PCI, which ultimately dissolved in 1991. ""The PCI was too slow to transform itself into a social-democratic party with a European vocation,"" he said. From now on, Napolitano's career would evolve within the institutions of the Italian Republic.He became president of the Chamber of Deputies in 1992 during the Tangentopoli investigation (a vast financing and corruption network). His tenure was marked with two feats that earned him the support of both his peers and public opinion. He used the Parliament's inviolability to oppose the judges who were investigating the corruption networks between elected officials and contractors but forced elected officials to vote with their faces uncovered when they were asked to remove one of their own so that he may be prosecuted.He also severed his ties with Socialist Party secretary Bettino Craxi, who was convicted of corruption and died in exile in Hammamet, Tunisia, in 2000. Napolitano was once again an ordinary MP when Silvio Berlusconi came to power in 1994 and was appointed interior minister in 1996 in Romano Prodi's first government. He was responsible for the law creating temporary detention centers for undocumented immigrants that is still in effect.Following the fall of the government, he found refuge in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2006, taking the chair of the influential Committee on Constitutional Affairs. In 2005, President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi appointed him Senator for life. The road to the Quirinal now lay open. On May 10, 2006, Napolitano was elected President of the Republic in the fourth round of voting. He was the first – and to this day the only – politician from the communist ranks to ever reach this position.While the role may seem symbolic despite the president being the head of the army, the guarantor of the nation's institutions and unity, its importance and influence largely depend on the circumstances in which it is exercised and the personalities with whom the head of state must deal. He could have been a debonair president like Sandro Pertini (1978-1985) or a combative one like Oscar Luigi Scalfaro (1992-1999), who opened hostilities with Silvio Berlusconi as soon as he was appointed President of the Council in 1994.Napolitano chose a third way. His apparent simplicity, his uneventful life with his wife Clio – with whom he has two sons – and his presence in the stands of the Berlin stadium in 2006 for the national soccer team's fourth World Cup title brought him closer to the Italian people, although no one would imagine tapping his shoulder. Berlusconi's third election to the presidency of the Council in 2008 was his chance to make full use of his evasiveness and soft touch.Everything opposed the two men: their style, origins and vision of the state. Two Italies confronted each other. While Berlusconi spiraled into scandals, worrying his European partners and the markets who considered him unfit to lead the country during a crisis, Napolitano was a reassuring presence, receiving heads of state and ambassadors at the Quirinal Palace and making numerous trips to Europe. He did not clash with his capricious President of the Council, except on rare occasions when the latter questioned his impartiality, at which time he would sidestep him and prepare the next steps.He came under criticism for engaging with Mario Monti, the future President of the Council from 2011, long before his predecessor was forced to resign. In 2013, after the parliamentarians seeking an elusive majority following the February general elections begged him to run for a second term, he succeeded in imposing Enrico Letta in the Chigi Palace. An expert in power relations educated by decades of political life, he knew this solution could only be temporary. Taking due note of Matteo Renzi's all-powerful hold over the center-left Democratic Party, he let him do as he pleased – and may have encouraged him to take over the presidency of the Council in 2014.Believing the country to be in good hands and convinced reforms ensuring Italy's governability (new voting system, end of bicameralism) would be carried out, he resigned on January 14, 2015, from his position as President of the Republic after a ninth speech to the Italians during the traditional end-of-year television address. He justified his decision by his age, which no longer allowed him to fully perform his function. Senior Christian Democrat Sergio Mattarella has replaced him and began his term in office in a very discreet manner before circumstances, much like his predecessor, pushed him to embrace his role as guardian of institutions threatened by the rise of anti-system rhetoric and Euroscepticism.Napolitano will then continue to seat at the Palazzo Madama for several years as a senator, receiving Italian and foreign officials who came to consult him from afar and with the utmost discretion, before his visits became increasingly infrequent due to his age. And so it was in the guise of an oracle that he ended a political career spanning over more than half a century, during which the ""red prince,"" the nickname of his beginnings, transformed, for the vast majority of Italians, into ""King Giorgio.""June 29, 1925 Born in Naples1945 Joins the Italian Communist Party (PCI)1969-1975 In charge of the PCI's cultural policy1992-1994 President of the

Former Italian President Giorgio Napolitano dies at 98,"    Premier Giorgia Meloni, whose far-right party is at the opposite end of the political spectrum of the late president, expressed condolences in the name of her government. ","A statement issued Friday, September 22, 2023, by the presidential palace in Rome confirmed Italian news reports of the death of Giorgio Napolitano, who had been ailing in a hospital in the capital for weeks.  The current president, Sergio Mattarella, in a message, hailed his predecessor as head of state, saying that Napolitano's life ""mirrored a large part of (Italy's) history in the second half of the 20th century, with its dramas, its complexity, its goals, its hopes.""In a condolence telegram to Napolitano's widow, Clio, Pope Francis said the late president ""showed great gifts of intellect and sincere passion for Italian political life as well as strong interest for the fates of nations"" The pontiff, who is on a pilgrimage to France, noted he had had personal meetings with Napolitano, ""during which I appreciated his humanity and long-range vision in assuming with rectitude important choices, especially in delicate moments for the life of the country""Napolitano was the first former Communist to rise to Italy's presidency and the first person to be elected twice to the mostly ceremonial post. As a prominent member of what had long been the largest Communist party in the West, Napolitano had advocated positions that often veered from party orthodoxy. He sought dialogue with Italian and European socialists to end his party's isolation and as an early backer of European integration.During the first Gulf War, Napolitano broke with the position of the leader of the Italian Communist Party to oppose the withdrawal of Italy's tiny contingent. That amounted to a radical evolution for a Communist politician, who at the time of the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary had hailed the suppression as necessary. Ultimately, his political reputation was shaped by his reformist views: After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Napolitano was among the staunchest supporters of his party's reform path, which would eventually lead to changing its name and dropping the hammer-and-sickle symbol.Like many other future politicians of his generation, Napolitano fought against the Italian Fascists and Nazi occupiers during World War II. When the war ended, he joined the Communist Party, and in 1953, he was elected to Parliament, an office he would hold for 10 straight legislatures. In 1989, he went to the United States with the party secretary for the first-ever visit by an Italian Communist leader.During his long career, Napolitano also served as speaker of Parliament's lower Chamber of Deputies and for five years as a lawmaker in the European Parliament. In 2005, his predecessor in the Quirinal palace, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, conferred on him one of Italy's greatest honors, making him a senator-for-life. A year later, Parliament would make him president of Italy, the first former Communist – and so far the only one – to serve as head of state.Admirers praised Napolitano's balanced attitude and gentlemanly ways. He was sometimes dubbed ""King Giorgio."" But critics pointed to what they saw as excessive caution. Still, when at the end of his first, seven-year term as head of state, bickering lawmakers couldn't reach a consensus on his successor, he broke with tradition and agreed to be elected to a second term – with the proviso that he wouldn't serve a full term due to advancing age. He was then 80.Napolitano resigned in January 2015, paving the way for Mattarella, a former Christian Democrat, to be elected. Mattarella would go on to be twice elected to the presidency, again after renewed political gridlock in Parliament thwarted the election of a fresh candidate in 2022.",Obituaries,statement issued friday september presidential palace rome confirmed italian news reports death giorgio napolitano ailing hospital capital weeks current president sergio mattarella message hailed predecessor head state saying napolitanos life mirrored large part italys history second half century dramas complexity goals hopes condolence telegram napolitanos widow clio pope francis said late president showed great gifts intellect sincere passion italian political life well strong interest fates nations pontiff pilgrimage france noted personal meetings napolitano appreciated humanity long range vision assuming rectitude important choices especially delicate moments life country napolitano first former communist rise italys presidency first person elected twice mostly ceremonial post prominent member long largest communist party west napolitano advocated positions often veered party orthodoxy sought dialogue italian european socialists end partys isolation early backer european integration first gulf war napolitano broke position leader italian communist party oppose withdrawal italys tiny contingent amounted radical evolution communist politician time soviet invasion hungary hailed suppression necessary ultimately political reputation shaped reformist views fall berlin wall napolitano among staunchest supporters partys reform path would eventually lead changing name dropping hammer sickle symbol like many future politicians generation napolitano fought italian fascists nazi occupiers world war war ended joined communist party elected parliament office would hold straight legislatures went united states party secretary first ever visit italian communist leader long career napolitano also served speaker parliaments lower chamber deputies five years lawmaker european parliament predecessor quirinal palace carlo azeglio ciampi conferred one italys greatest honors making senator life year later parliament would make president italy first former communist far one serve head state admirers praised napolitanos balanced attitude gentlemanly ways sometimes dubbed king giorgio critics pointed saw excessive caution still end first seven year term head state bickering lawmakers couldnt reach consensus successor broke tradition agreed elected second term proviso wouldnt serve full term due advancing age napolitano resigned january paving way mattarella former christian democrat elected mattarella would twice elected presidency renewed political gridlock parliament thwarted election fresh candidate,statement issu friday septemb presidenti palac rome confirm italian news report death giorgio napolitano ail hospit capit week current presid sergio mattarella messag hail predecessor head state say napolitano life mirror larg part itali histori second half centuri drama complex goal hope condol telegram napolitano widow clio pope franci said late presid show great gift intellect sincer passion italian polit life well strong interest fate nation pontiff pilgrimag franc note person meet napolitano appreci human long rang vision assum rectitud import choic especi delic moment life countri napolitano first former communist rise itali presid first person elect twice mostli ceremoni post promin member long largest communist parti west napolitano advoc posit often veer parti orthodoxi sought dialogu italian european socialist end parti isol earli backer european integr first gulf war napolitano broke posit leader italian communist parti oppos withdraw itali tini conting amount radic evolut communist politician time soviet invas hungari hail suppress necessari ultim polit reput shape reformist view fall berlin wall napolitano among staunchest support parti reform path would eventu lead chang name drop hammer sickl symbol like mani futur politician gener napolitano fought italian fascist nazi occupi world war war end join communist parti elect parliament offic would hold straight legislatur went unit state parti secretari first ever visit italian communist leader long career napolitano also serv speaker parliament lower chamber deputi five year lawmak european parliament predecessor quirin palac carlo azeglio ciampi confer one itali greatest honor make senat life year later parliament would make presid itali first former communist far one serv head state admir prais napolitano balanc attitud gentlemanli way sometim dub king giorgio critic point saw excess caution still end first seven year term head state bicker lawmak couldnt reach consensu successor broke tradit agre elect second term proviso wouldnt serv full term due advanc age napolitano resign januari pave way mattarella former christian democrat elect mattarella would twice elect presid renew polit gridlock parliament thwart elect fresh candid
Colombian artist Fernando Botero dies aged 91,"    Considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, the Colombian artist was most famous for his voluptuous figures. His death was announced on Friday. ","Colombia's most famous artist, Fernando Botero, who was known for his voluptuous depictions of people and animals, has died aged 91, President Gustavo Petro announced on Friday, September 15.Botero's works of plump and slightly surreal forms became enormously popular and were on display in museums and public spaces in cities around the world, including Bogota, Madrid, Paris, Singapore and Venice.""Fernando Botero, the painter of our traditions and defects, the painter of our virtues, has died,"" the president posted on social media.Botero's hometown, Medellin, declared a week of mourning, with Mayor Daniel Quintero saying his works on display in that city ""will live forever."" Local media hailed Botero as the greatest Colombian artist of all time, reporting his health had deteriorated in recent days as he suffered pneumonia.Botero – who had been dubbed the ""Picasso of Latin America"" – was a passionate and tireless artist, his oeuvre of more than 3,000 paintings and 300 sculptures proof of an insatiable appetite to create.Even in his later years, he said he was working 10 hours a day. ""I work more now perhaps because I know that there is so little time left,"" he said an interview with Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 2012, the year of his 80th birthday. ""I often think about death and it saddens me to leave this world and not be able to paint more. I love it so much.""Botero was drawn to art at a young age and by 15 was selling his paintings of bulls and matadors at the La Macarena bullfighting ring in Colombia's second-largest city, Medellin, where he was born on April 19, 1932, the son of a modest travelling salesman.After a first solo exhibition in the capital Bogota in the 1950s, Botero left for Europe, travelling to Spain, France and Italy, where he discovered classical art.He moved on to Mexico, becoming influenced by its muralists, and then to New York in 1960, arriving with ""$200 in my pocket"", he said in the 2012 interview.It was there that he met a German art curator who organized triumphant exhibitions in Germany in the 1970s, launching his name. ""I went from being a complete unknown without even a New York gallery to being contacted by the biggest merchants in the world,"" he said.The trademark oversized dimensions of his work emerged in 1957 in his painting ""Still Life with Mandolin"". He discovered ""a new dimension that was more voluminous, more monumental, more extravagant, more extreme.""An admirer of Italian Renaissance art, he did not accept the interpretation that his subjects are fat. ""If I paint a woman, a man, a dog or a horse, I always do with this idea of the volume. It is not that I have an obsession with fat women,"" he said in an interview with daily Spanish newspaper El Mundo in 2014.Sculpture became a major component of his work, developed at a renowned Italian center of sculpture, Pietrasanta.Botero said he was inspired by beauty but also the troubles of his native country, gripped by armed conflict for more than 50 years.In 1995 a powerful bomb placed at his sculpture ""The Bird"" in Medellin killed around 30 people and wounded scores. Botero in 2000 donated a replica to stand beside the exploded sculpture and called ""Bird of Peace"".Some of his work portrays scenes of Colombian guerrilla fighters, earthquakes and brothels. In a departure, he produced in the 2000s a series depicting abuse and torture at the US-run Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, saying afterward he was driven by shock and anger.""Themes of power and excess are not entirely new to Mr. Botero's seemingly sunny art,"" The New York Times said in a 2006 review. ""His evocations of obesity itself imply a sinister cluelessness.""Married three times, his last bride being Greek artist Sophia Vari, Botero had four children, one of whom died in an accident aged four.",Obituaries,colombias famous artist fernando botero known voluptuous people animals died aged president gustavo petro announced friday september boteros works plump slightly surreal forms became enormously popular display museums public spaces cities around world including bogota madrid paris singapore venice fernando botero painter traditions defects painter virtues died president posted social media boteros hometown medellin declared week mourning mayor daniel quintero saying works display city live forever local media hailed botero greatest colombian artist time reporting health deteriorated recent days suffered pneumonia botero dubbed latin america passionate tireless artist oeuvre paintings sculptures proof insatiable appetite create even later years said working hours day work perhaps know little time left said interview agence france presse afp year birthday often think death saddens leave world able paint love much botero drawn art young age selling paintings bulls matadors macarena bullfighting ring colombias second largest city medellin born april son modest travelling salesman first solo exhibition capital bogota botero left europe travelling spain france italy discovered classical art moved mexico becoming influenced muralists new york arriving pocket said interview met german art curator organized triumphant exhibitions germany launching name went complete unknown without even new york gallery contacted biggest merchants world said trademark oversized dimensions work emerged painting still life mandolin discovered new dimension voluminous monumental extravagant extreme admirer italian renaissance art accept interpretation subjects fat paint woman man dog horse always idea volume obsession fat women said interview daily spanish newspaper mundo sculpture became major component work developed renowned italian center sculpture pietrasanta botero said inspired beauty also troubles native country gripped armed conflict years powerful bomb placed sculpture bird medellin killed around people wounded scores botero donated replica stand beside exploded sculpture called bird peace work portrays scenes colombian guerrilla fighters earthquakes brothels departure produced series abuse torture run abu ghraib prison iraq saying afterward driven shock anger themes power excess entirely new boteros seemingly sunny art new york times said review evocations obesity imply sinister cluelessness married three times last bride greek artist sophia vari botero four children one died accident aged four,colombia famou artist fernando botero known voluptu peopl anim die age presid gustavo petro announc friday septemb botero work plump slightli surreal form becam enorm popular display museum public space citi around world includ bogota madrid pari singapor venic fernando botero painter tradit defect painter virtu die presid post social media botero hometown medellin declar week mourn mayor daniel quintero say work display citi live forev local media hail botero greatest colombian artist time report health deterior recent day suffer pneumonia botero dub latin america passion tireless artist oeuvr paint sculptur proof insati appetit creat even later year said work hour day work perhap know littl time left said interview agenc franc press afp year birthday often think death sadden leav world abl paint love much botero drawn art young age sell paint bull matador macarena bullfight ring colombia second largest citi medellin born april son modest travel salesman first solo exhibit capit bogota botero left europ travel spain franc itali discov classic art move mexico becom influenc muralist new york arriv pocket said interview met german art curat organ triumphant exhibit germani launch name went complet unknown without even new york galleri contact biggest merchant world said trademark overs dimens work emerg paint still life mandolin discov new dimens volumin monument extravag extrem admir italian renaiss art accept interpret subject fat paint woman man dog hors alway idea volum obsess fat women said interview daili spanish newspap mundo sculptur becam major compon work develop renown italian center sculptur pietrasanta botero said inspir beauti also troubl nativ countri grip arm conflict year power bomb place sculptur bird medellin kill around peopl wound score botero donat replica stand besid explod sculptur call bird peac work portray scene colombian guerrilla fighter earthquak brothel departur produc seri abus tortur run abu ghraib prison iraq say afterward driven shock anger theme power excess entir new botero seemingli sunni art new york time said review evoc obes impli sinist clueless marri three time last bride greek artist sophia vari botero four children one die accid age four
Scottish-born actor David McCallum dies at 90,"    McCallum, who became a teen heartthrob in the hit series 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' in the 1960s – and was the eccentric medical examiner in the popular 'NCIS' 40 years later – passed in New York on Monday, September 25, 2024. ","""David was a gifted actor and author, and beloved by many around the world. He led an incredible life, and his legacy will forever live on through his family and the countless hours on film and television that will never go away,"" said a statement from CBS, announcing the actor's passing on Monday, September 25. He died of natural causes, surrounded by family, at New York Presbyterian Hospital.David McCallum had been doing well appearing in such films A Night to Remember, The Great Escape, and The Greatest Story Ever Told (in which he played the role of the apostle Judas). But it was The Man From U.N.C.L.E. that made the blond actor with the Beatlesque haircut a household name in the mid-'60s.The show, which debuted in 1964, starred Robert Vaughn as Napoleon Solo, an agent in a secretive, high-tech squad of crime fighters whose initials stood for United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. Despite the Cold War, the agency had an international staff, with McCallum as Illya Kuryakin, Solo's Russian sidekick. The role was relatively small at first, McCallum recalled, adding in a 1998 interview that ""I'd never heard of the word ‘sidekick' before."" The show drew mixed reviews but eventually caught on, particularly with teenage girls attracted by McCallum's good looks and enigmatic, intellectual character. By 1965, Illya was a full partner to Vaughn's character and both stars were mobbed during personal appearances. The series lasted until 1968. Vaughn and McCallum reunited in 1983 for a nostalgic TV movie, The Return of the Man From U.N.C.L.E., in which the agents were lured out of retirement to save the world once more.McCallum returned to television in 2003 in another series with an agency known by its initials – CBS' NCIS. He played Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard, a bookish pathologist for the Naval Criminal Investigation Service, an agency handling crimes involving the Navy or the Marines. Mark Harmon played the NCIS boss. McCallum said he thought Ducky, who sported glasses and a bow tie and had an eye for pretty women, ""looked a little silly, but it was great fun to do."" He took the role seriously, too, spending time in the Los Angeles coroner's office to gain insight into how autopsies are conducted.McCallum's work with U.N.C.L.E. brought him two Emmy nominations, and he got a third as an educator struggling with alcoholism in a 1969 Hallmark Hall of Fame drama called Teacher, Teacher.",Obituaries,david gifted actor author beloved many around world led incredible life legacy forever live family countless hours film television never away said statement cbs announcing actors passing monday september died natural causes surrounded family new york presbyterian hospital david mccallum well appearing films night remember great escape greatest story ever told played role apostle judas man made blond actor beatlesque haircut household name mid show debuted starred robert vaughn napoleon solo agent secretive high tech squad crime fighters whose initials stood united network command law enforcement despite cold war agency international staff mccallum illya kuryakin solos russian sidekick role relatively small first mccallum recalled adding interview never heard word sidekick show drew mixed reviews eventually caught particularly teenage girls attracted mccallums good looks enigmatic intellectual character illya full partner vaughns character stars mobbed personal appearances series lasted vaughn mccallum reunited nostalgic movie return man agents lured retirement save world mccallum returned television another series agency known initials cbs ncis played donald ducky mallard bookish pathologist naval criminal investigation service agency handling crimes involving navy marines mark harmon played ncis boss mccallum said thought ducky sported glasses bow tie eye pretty women looked little silly great fun took role seriously spending time los angeles coroners office gain insight autopsies conducted mccallums work brought two emmy nominations got third educator struggling alcoholism hallmark hall fame drama called teacher teacher,david gift actor author belov mani around world led incred life legaci forev live famili countless hour film televis never away said statement cb announc actor pass monday septemb die natur caus surround famili new york presbyterian hospit david mccallum well appear film night rememb great escap greatest stori ever told play role apostl juda man made blond actor beatlesqu haircut household name mid show debut star robert vaughn napoleon solo agent secret high tech squad crime fighter whose initi stood unit network command law enforc despit cold war agenc intern staff mccallum illya kuryakin solo russian sidekick role rel small first mccallum recal ad interview never heard word sidekick show drew mix review eventu caught particularli teenag girl attract mccallum good look enigmat intellectu charact illya full partner vaughn charact star mob person appear seri last vaughn mccallum reunit nostalg movi return man agent lure retir save world mccallum return televis anoth seri agenc known initi cb nci play donald ducki mallard bookish pathologist naval crimin investig servic agenc handl crime involv navi marin mark harmon play nci boss mccallum said thought ducki sport glass bow tie eye pretti women look littl silli great fun took role serious spend time lo angel coron offic gain insight autopsi conduct mccallum work brought two emmi nomin got third educ struggl alcohol hallmark hall fame drama call teacher teacher
Cosa Nostra boss and once most wanted man in Italy dies at 61,"    Matteo Messina Denaro was apprehended earlier this year in a private clinic in Palermo (Italy), after three decades in hiding. He died in his hospital bed in the city of L'Aquila during the night of September 24, 2023. ","Sicilian Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro, aged 61 years old, had colon cancer, for which he had sought treatment while on the run – a decision that brought him to the attention of the authorities, who arrested him at a clinic in Palermo. He was detained in a high-security jail in L'Aquila, central Italy, where he continued treatment for his cancer in his cell, where he died.Messina Denaro was one of the most ruthless bosses in Cosa Nostra, the real-life Sicilian crime syndicate depicted in the Godfather movies. He was convicted by the courts of involvement in the murder of anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone in 1992 and in deadly bombings in Rome, Florence, and Milan in 1993. One of his six life sentences was also handed down for the kidnapping and subsequent murder of the 12-year-old son of a witness in the Falcone case.Messina Denaro disappeared in the summer of 1993 and spent the next 30 years on the run as the Italian state cracked down on the Sicilian mob. But he remained the top name on Italy's most-wanted list and, increasingly became a figure of legend.In a stunning swoop, he was arrested on January 16, 2023, as he visited a health clinic where he was being treated using a fake identity. In August, Messina Denaro was moved to the inmates' ward of the San Salvatore hospital in the central Italian town of L'Aquila, where his condition had declined in recent days. This weekend, media reports said he was in an ""irreversible coma"". Medics had stopped feeding him and he had asked not to be resuscitated, they added.After Messina Denaro went on the run, there was intense speculation that he had gone abroad – and he likely did. But in the end, he was found to have been staying near his hometown of Castelvetrano in western Sicily. Investigators had been combing the Sicilian countryside for Messina Denaro for years, searching for hideouts and wiretapping members of his family and his friends.

"Actor Michael Gambon, famous for playing Dumbledore in 'Harry Potter,' dies aged 82","    Sir Gambon won four BAFTAs over a career spanning television, film, radio and theater. ","Veteran actor Michael Gambon, who was known to many for his portrayal of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore in six of the eight Harry Potter films, has died, his publicist said on Thursday, September 28. He was 82.A statement by his family, issued by his publicist, said he died following ""a bout of pneumonia."" ""We are devastated to announce the loss of Sir Michael Gambon. Beloved husband and father, Michael died peacefully in hospital with his wife Anne and son Fergus at his bedside,"" his family said.No matter what role he took on in a career that lasted more than five decades, Gambon was always instantly recognizable by the deep and drawling tones of his voice. He was cast as the much-loved Dumbledore after the death of his predecessor, Richard Harris, in 2002.He once acknowledged not having read any of J. K. Rowling's best-selling books, arguing that it was safer to follow the script rather than be too influenced by the books. That didn't prevent him from embodying the spirit of Professor Dumbledore, the powerful wizard who fought against evil to protect his students.Although the Potter role raised Gambon's international profile and introduced him to a new generation of fans, he had long been recognized as one of Britain's leading actors. His work spanned TV, theater and radio, and he starred in dozens of films from Gosford Park to The King's Speech and the animated family movie Paddington. Gambon was knighted for services to drama in 1998.Born in Dublin, Ireland, on October 19, 1940, Gambon was raised in London and originally trained as an engineer, following in the footsteps of his father. He made his theater debut in a production of Othello in Dublin.In 1963 he got his first big break with a minor role in Hamlet, the National Theatre Company's opening production, under the directorship of the legendary Laurence Olivier.Gambon soon became a distinguished stage actor and received critical acclaim for his leading performance in Life of Galileo directed by John Dexter. He was frequently nominated for awards and won the Laurence Olivier Award 3 times and the Critics' Circle Theatre Awards twice.A multi-talented actor, Gambon was also the recipient of four coveted British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards for his television work.He became a household name in Britain after his lead role in the 1986 BBC series The Singing Detective, written by Dennis Potter and considered a classic of British television drama. Gambon won the BAFTA for best actor for the role.Gambon was versatile as an actor but once told the BBC of his preference for playing ""villainous characters."" He played gangster Eddie Temple in the British crime thriller Layer Cake – a review of the film by the New York Times referred to Gambon as ""reliably excellent"" – and a Satanic crime boss in Peter Greenaway's The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover.He also had a part as King George V in the 2010 drama film The King's Speech. In 2015 he returned to the works of J.K. Rowling, taking a leading role in the TV adaptation of her book The Casual Vacancy.Gambon retired from the stage in 2015 after struggling to remember his lines in front of an audience due to his advancing age. He once told the Sunday Times Magazine: ""It's a horrible thing to admit, but I can't do it. It breaks my heart.""The actor was always protective when it came to his private life.

"Michael Gambon, Irish-English actor who ruled the stage and halls of Hogwarts, has died","    Although best known internationally for his role as Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series, Gambon was also a stalwart of the theater. He died of pneumonia on September 27 at the age of 82. ","Were it not for the untimely death of Richard Harris in 2002, a week before the release of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, leaving vacant the principal's position at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, this obituary probably would not exist. Michael Gambon, who replaced Harris as Albus Dumbledore from Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) to Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2, owes most of his fame outside the UK to his involvement in the Harry Potter saga.Yet this kindly but shrewd wizard character is not enough to sum up the career of an actor who was not only one of the pillars of British stage, from the 1980s to the turn of the century, but also the star of a seminal series in the history of television – The Singing Detective – and a supporting actor who often overshadowed his leading men on the silver screen. Gambon died of pneumonia in London on Wednesday, September 27, his family announced. He was 82 years old.Gambon was born in Dublin on October 19, 1940. In 1946, he and his mother joined his father, who had crossed the Irish Sea to participate in the rebuilding of London, earning him dual British and Irish citizenship. As a teenager, he took courses in mechanics, which led to a job with the Vickers-Armstrong aircraft manufacturer.It was while helping to build sets for an amateur theatre company that he was bitten by the acting bug. Posing as a London actor, he managed to get hired by an Irish company, then joined Sir Laurence Olivier's National Theatre Company. There, he played supporting parts until Olivier advised him to move away from London, to try his hand at more serious roles. In Birmingham, he played Othello, Macbeth and Coriolan.In 1970, he returned to London and dazzled critics and audiences alike in the lead role in The Life of Galileo, by Bertolt Brecht, directed by John Dexter. He then went on to become one of the stars of the contemporary British stage, playing Harold Pinter (taking part in the creation of Betrayal ), David Hare and Alan Ayckbourn. Ayckbourn directed him in Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge, in 1987, in the role of docker Eddie Carbone. This performance further cemented the actor's reputation.His physique, which he likened to a ""crumpled plastic bag,"" made him unsuitable for certain roles, starting with Hamlet. This did not prevent him from exuding a sort of authority and charm that were at times irresistible, as the students at Hogwarts came to realize.Around the same time, he started working in film and television. In 1986, writer Dennis Potter entrusted Gambon with the dual role of The Singing Detective, a detective, poetic and musical series, where he plays both a writer confined to his hospital bed by a disfiguring illness and the hero of the noir novels born of his imagination. The series helped establish the artistic legitimacy of the serial format. On the silver screen, Gambon played the thief in The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, (1989) by Peter Greenaway, alongside Richard Bohringer and Helen Mirren.",Obituaries,untimely death richard harris week release harry potter chamber secrets leaving vacant principals position hogwarts school witchcraft wizardry obituary probably would exist michael gambon replaced harris albus dumbledore prisoner azkaban deathly hallows parts owes fame outside involvement harry potter saga yet kindly shrewd wizard character enough sum career actor one pillars british stage turn century also star seminal series history television singing detective supporting actor often overshadowed leading men silver screen gambon died pneumonia london wednesday september family announced years old gambon born dublin october mother joined father crossed irish sea participate rebuilding london earning dual british irish citizenship teenager took courses mechanics led job vickers armstrong aircraft manufacturer helping build sets amateur theatre company bitten acting bug posing london actor managed get hired irish company joined sir laurence oliviers national theatre company played supporting parts olivier advised move away london try hand serious roles birmingham played othello macbeth coriolan returned london dazzled critics audiences alike lead role life galileo bertolt brecht directed john dexter went become one stars contemporary british stage playing harold pinter taking part creation betrayal david hare alan ayckbourn ayckbourn directed arthur millers view bridge role docker eddie carbone performance cemented actors reputation physique likened crumpled plastic bag made unsuitable certain roles starting hamlet prevent exuding sort authority charm times irresistible students hogwarts came realize around time started working film television writer dennis potter entrusted gambon dual role singing detective detective poetic musical series plays writer confined hospital bed disfiguring illness hero noir novels born imagination series helped establish artistic legitimacy serial format silver screen gambon played thief cook thief wife lover peter greenaway alongside richard bohringer helen mirren,untim death richard harri week releas harri potter chamber secret leav vacant princip posit hogwart school witchcraft wizardri obituari probabl would exist michael gambon replac harri albu dumbledor prison azkaban deathli hallow part owe fame outsid involv harri potter saga yet kindli shrewd wizard charact enough sum career actor one pillar british stage turn centuri also star semin seri histori televis sing detect support actor often overshadow lead men silver screen gambon die pneumonia london wednesday septemb famili announc year old gambon born dublin octob mother join father cross irish sea particip rebuild london earn dual british irish citizenship teenag took cours mechan led job vicker armstrong aircraft manufactur help build set amateur theatr compani bitten act bug pose london actor manag get hire irish compani join sir laurenc olivi nation theatr compani play support part olivi advis move away london tri hand seriou role birmingham play othello macbeth coriolan return london dazzl critic audienc alik lead role life galileo bertolt brecht direct john dexter went becom one star contemporari british stage play harold pinter take part creation betray david hare alan ayckbourn ayckbourn direct arthur miller view bridg role docker eddi carbon perform cement actor reput physiqu liken crumpl plastic bag made unsuit certain role start hamlet prevent exud sort author charm time irresist student hogwart came realiz around time start work film televis writer denni potter entrust gambon dual role sing detect detect poetic music seri play writer confin hospit bed disfigur ill hero noir novel born imagin seri help establish artist legitimaci serial format silver screen gambon play thief cook thief wife lover peter greenaway alongsid richard bohring helen mirren

"Louise Glück, US poet and Nobel laureate, dies at 80","    Glück, a poet of unblinking candor and perception who wove classical allusions, philosophical reveries, bittersweet memories and humorous asides into indelible portraits of a fallen and heartrending world, passed away on Friday. ","American poet Louise Glück, winner of the Nobel and Pulitzer prizes for her distinctively austere writing, has died, a Yale University spokeswoman told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Friday, October 13. The New York native, 80, most recently taught at Yale as a poetry professor. She died of cancer, The New York Times reported, citing friend and former Yale colleague Richard Deming, on Friday at her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Glück was the 2020 Nobel laureate in literature, the 16th woman to win the award. Her idols included other winners of the same prize, such as William Butler Yeats (1923) and T.S. Eliot (1948). Like theirs, the austerity of her poetry was a source of strength: ""The unsaid, for me, exerts great power,"" she wrote in a collection of essays on poetry, ""Proofs and Theories.""Glück's work was informed by subjects such as nature's simple beauty and a child's experience of the world, coupled with the bold storylines of mythology.

"Hubert Reeves, Canadian-French astrophysicist and science popularizer, dies aged 91","    A specialist in the history of the cosmos, Reeves made science accessible to all. He died in Paris on October 13, aged 91. ","With his patriarchal silhouette – balding head, white beard, sparkling blue eyes – his singing Quebec accent and his precise, colorful words, Hubert Reeves was both the grandfather who could tell us wonderful stories and the wizard who mixed the ingredients of the Universe in his cauldron. A pint of Milky Way, an extract of Moon, a few mysterious grains of dark matter... He explained to us that we were all made of stardust, as most of the elements that make us up, such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, come directly from stellar forges. At the end of his time on Earth, on October 13, the astrophysicist returned to this cosmic dust. He was 91 years old.It was easy to forget he had ever been a child. Yet Reeves, born in Montréal on July 13, 1932, would often travel back in time to his youth. He would evoke the large wooden family home overlooking Lake Saint-Louis, which his grandfather had built at the beginning of the 20th century and where he had so many memories: canoe trips, his mother's call at nightfall (""Have you seen the sky?"") and, last but not least, his maternal grandmother, Charlotte Tourangeau, to whom Hubert owed his storytelling talents, and who must be mentioned here. Charlotte Tourangeau had no equal when it came to embellishing Charles Perrault's stories, extending and even mixing them to suit her imagination.""What you value by saying 'that's interesting', your children find valuable,"" he once told Le Monde during a meeting in 2002. ""My parents loved anything to do with the natural sciences, so the idea that I would work in science came to me very early on."" Fond of mathematics, the young Reeves opted for theoretical physics, which he studied first in Montreal and then in the United States at Cornell University in New York State, where, he recalled, ""the founders of nuclear astrophysics were to be found. There was the magic of the great American universities, where you feel capable of doing great things. There was an infectious creativity that gave you wings."" At Cornell, he completed his thesis under the supervision of Edwin Salpeter (1924-2008), who became famous for showing how stars, by fusing three helium atoms, give rise to a carbon atom.Reeves dived into the Universe's past, understanding that to be an astrophysicist was to become the historian of the cosmos and of matter. He was particularly interested in three light elements – lithium, beryllium and boron – too big to have been made at the time of the big bang, but too fragile to have been conceived in the thermonuclear fire of the stars. With Jean Audouze, the Canadian researcher showed that these elements are created when high-energy cosmic rays break up carbon, oxygen or nitrogen nuclei in space. In 2018, astrophysicist Michel Cassé, one of Hubert Reeves' PhD students, said: ""It's a paper that marked the times. Hubert had a very penetrating way of thinking about things in the sky. He wasn't sophisticated, he wasn't a dandy: he really went straight to the point without getting bogged down in frills.""In the early 1960s, Reeves taught in Montreal and became a scientific advisor to NASA. There, he trained professors for the space science departments that were springing up all over the place in US universities as the conquest of space took off. But, uncomfortable with the nationalist atmosphere in Quebec and eager to explore other horizons, he had his heart set on Europe. In 1964, he took a sabbatical and taught nuclear physics at the Université libre de Bruxelles. He was then invited to share his knowledge in France. It was a turning point in his life. He never looked back.Director of research at the CNRS, France's national scientific research center, and scientific advisor to the French Atomic Energy Commission, Reeves has followed a well-established career path. His second life, that of a media darling and storyteller of the stars, fell into his lap somewhat by chance. Encouraged by friends, he wrote a first manuscript entitled Patience dans l'azur (""Patience in the Blue""), in reference to a poem by Paul Valéry. He presented it to some thirty publishers, all of whom refused to publish it, foolishly believing that astronomy was of no interest to anyone, despite the universal questions about the origins of the world to which it provides answers.Reeves was about to put his manuscript away in a drawer and remain the almost anonymous researcher that he was, until the physicist Jean-Marc Lévy-Leblond, who heads the ""Science ouverte"" collection at Editions du Seuil, suggests that he...write a book. It was already ready: Patience dans l'azur was published in 1981, and the French discovered Reeves who recounted the cosmos like one reads a novel.""I was told I'd be lucky if it sold three thousand copies. Today, we've sold over a million copies and it's been translated into over thirty languages,"" Reeves told Le Monde in 2002. In the early 1980s, fame swooped down on him like a bird of prey on a field mouse, but he knew he had to be wary of it and keep it at arm's length: ""Fame is destabilizing, intoxicating and a little dangerous: you run the risk of getting a big head. Fortunately, my wife and friends keep an eye on me."" The book-television-lecture cycle began. Some thirty books followed Patience dans l'azur, including Dernières nouvelles du cosmos (""Latest news from the Cosmos"", 1994), and his memoirs Je n'aurai pas le temps (""I Won't Have Time"", 2008).A request for a lecture would arrive in the mail everyday and he imposed strict discipline on himself after too much involvement in his work cost him a divorce followed by depression. He gave one lecture a week in France and one a month abroad. In all, he gave more than 2,500 lectures.Reeves also took on the role of environmentalist. In 2001, he succeeded Théodore Monod as the head of the Ligue ROC for the preservation of wildlife. A few years later, the organization was renamed Humanité et biodiversité (Humanity and Biodiversity), and he became its honorary chairman. His love of nature, inherited from his parents, never left him.With his second wife, the journalist Camille Scoffier, he bought ""a dilapidated old farmhouse,"" in northern France, as he recounted in his memoirs. There are century-old oaks there, but Reeves wanted to go further by creating what he called ""the millennium forest, trees that can live for over a thousand years: cedars of Lebanon, redwoods, lime trees, ginkgos.""Distressed by global warming, pollution and the loss of biodiversity that he himself observed in the garden of his country home, he puts his fame at the service of the climate struggle. He wrote articles and called on mayors, members of parliament and candidates in the 2012 presidential election. ""In Malicorne, I had long seen him take a deep interest in plants and birds, which meant a lot to him,"" Michel Cassé told Le Monde in 2018. He summed up his friend's career as follows: ""After skimming the skies, he became passionate about the Earth.""In Je n'aurai pas le temps, Reeves asserted that astronomy and ecology could be seen ""as two facets of the same theme: our existence. Astronomy, by telling us the story of the Universe, tells us where we came from, and how we came to be here today. Ecology, by making us aware of the threats to our future, aims to tell us how to stay there.""",Obituaries,patriarchal silhouette balding head white beard sparkling blue eyes singing quebec accent

"Arras terror attack: The death of Dominique Bernard, a respected literature teacher who 'took his work to heart'",    The 57-year-old teacher was killed by Mohammed M. on Friday. Three other people were injured in the attack. ,"""Monsieur Bernard,"" as the students called him, was ""a very patient teacher, really respectful."" ""And he could be funny too,"" said Anna. This high school student had barricaded herself in her classroom on Friday, October 13 when her ""teacher shouted that we had to close all the doors,"" as the terrorist entered their Gambetta-Carnot high school in the northern town of Arras.In front of the school, parents recalled who Dominique Bernard was, the 57-year-old French teacher who was killed by the assailant. The father of three daughters, who came from a family of teachers and was married to an English teacher, ""took time out for parent-teacher meetings and was a great listener."" ""He died because he tried to protect our children,"" lamented the mother of a high school student.Bernard studied literature in Lille, Northern Franc, and had been teaching there since the 1980s. Bruno Lecat, who shared the university benches with him, remembers him as ""a rich human being, very generous and attentive to others. He was a truly beautiful person."" During his studies, he formed a theater company with Nathalie Raoul, who described him to Agence France-Presse as a ""respectful, a little secretive, very delicate"" man. ""His personality was essential to the functioning of the group, with a great deal of discretion and originality"". At the time, he was a ""very intelligent student, not at all into fads or trends, a very unique person.""Bernard was ""a lover of literature who knew how to pass on his passion,"" and ""a hard-working teacher who took his work very much to heart,"" said philosophy teacher Damien Dousseau. ""He was a very cultured person with many interests. Outside his work here, he regularly gave lectures on literature, as well as cinema and music,"" added a distraught colleague and friend. Fabien Dufay, a sports teacher at Gambetta high school, recalled a ""very friendly colleague, with whom we used to have a lot of fun in the staff room.""In 2002, Bernard was one of the founders of the Université Populaire d'Arras (now closed), an open university created in the spirit of the schools founded by French philosopher Michel Onfray. Paule Orsoni, a retired philosophy teacher who worked alongside him on this project, called him a ""brilliant man with a very keen eye, a great connoisseur of Julien Gracq and René Char."" Bernard was also an avid traveler, taking the opportunity to indulge in another of his passions: cultural heritage and monuments.The students emphasized his personal qualities: ""He was very fair, he respected us. He didn't play favorites and we were all the same to him,"" said 16-year-old Sacha Ahlers. Alysée Lecœur's sister, a student, had him as her main teacher in 2020. She remembers that ""Mr. Bernard succeeded in making (her sister) love French, while before, she rarely opened a book. He knew how to bring life to his lessons and talk about writers in a way that interested students."" ""He was fair and warm,"" she added, and ""didn't need to raise his voice to be respected.""

'Carrie' actress Piper Laurie dies at 91,"    The actress, three-time Academy Award nominee for 'The Hustler,' 'Carrie' and 'Children of a Lesser God,' died early Saturday in her home in Los Angeles. ","Piper Laurie, the strong-willed, Oscar-nominated actor who performed in acclaimed roles despite at one point abandoning acting altogether in search of a ""more meaningful"" life, died early Saturday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91. Laurie died of old age, her manager, Marion Rosenberg, told The Associated Press via email, adding that she was ""a superb talent and a wonderful human being.""Laurie arrived in Hollywood in 1949 as Rosetta Jacobs and was quickly given a contract with Universal-International, a new name that she hated and a string of starring roles with Ronald Reagan, Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis, among others. She went on to receive Academy Award nominations for three distinct films: the 1961 poolroom drama The Hustler; the film version of Stephen King's horror classic Carrie, in 1976; and the romantic drama Children of a Lesser God, in 1986. She also appeared in several acclaimed roles on television and the stage, including in David Lynch's Twin Peaks in the 1990s as the villainous Catherine Martell.Laurie made her debut at 17 in Louisa, playing Reagan's daughter, then appeared opposite Francis the talking mule in Francis Goes to the Races. She made several films with Curtis, whom she once dated, including The Prince Who Was a Thief, No Room for the Groom, Son of Ali Baba and Johnny Dark.Fed up, she walked out on her $2,000-a-week contract in 1955, vowing she wouldn't work again unless offered a decent part. She moved to New York, where she found the roles she was seeking in theater and live television drama.Performances in Days of Wine and Roses, The Deaf Heart and The Road That Led After brought her Emmy nominations and paved the way for a return to films, including in an acclaimed role as Paul Newman's troubled girlfriend in The Hustler.For many years after, Laurie turned her back on acting. She married film critic Joseph Morgenstern, welcomed a daughter, Ann Grace, and moved to a farmhouse in Woodstock, New York. She said later that the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War had influenced her decision to make the change.""I was disenchanted and looking for an existence more meaningful for me,"" she recalled, adding that she never regretted the move. ""My life was full,"" she said in 1990. ""I always liked using my hands, and I always painted."" Laurie also became noted as a baker, with her recipes appearing in The New York Times.Her only performance during that time came when she joined a dozen musicians and actors on a tour of college campuses to support Senator George McGovern's 1972 presidential bid.Laurie was finally ready to return to acting when director Brian De Palma called her about playing the deranged mother of Sissy Spacek in Carrie.At first, she felt the script was junk, and then she decided she should play the role for laughs. Not until De Palma chided her for putting a comedic turn on a scene did she realize he meant the film to be a thriller.Carrie became a box-office smash, launching a craze for movies about teenagers in jeopardy, and Spacek and Laurie were both nominated for Academy Awards.Her desire to act rekindled, Laurie resumed a busy career that spanned decades. On television, she appeared in such series as Matlock, Murder, She Wrote and Frasier and played George Clooney's mother on ER.",Obituaries,piper laurie strong willed oscar nominated actor performed acclaimed roles despite one point abandoning acting altogether search meaningful life died early saturday home los angeles laurie died old age manager marion rosenberg told associated press via email adding superb talent wonderful human laurie arrived hollywood rosetta jacobs quickly given contract universal international new name hated string starring roles ronald reagan rock hudson tony curtis among others went receive academy award nominations three distinct films poolroom drama hustler film version stephen kings horror classic carrie romantic drama children lesser god also appeared several acclaimed roles television stage including david lynchs twin peaks villainous catherine martell laurie made debut louisa playing reagans daughter appeared opposite francis talking mule francis goes races made several films curtis dated including prince thief room groom son ali baba johnny dark fed walked week contract vowing wouldnt work unless offered decent part moved new york found roles seeking theater live television drama performances days wine roses deaf heart road led brought emmy nominations paved way return films including acclaimed role paul newmans troubled girlfriend hustler many years laurie turned back acting married film critic joseph morgenstern welcomed daughter ann grace moved farmhouse woodstock new york said later civil rights movement vietnam war influenced decision make change disenchanted looking existence meaningful recalled adding never regretted move life full said always liked using hands always painted laurie also became noted baker recipes appearing new york times performance time came joined dozen musicians actors tour college campuses support senator george mcgoverns presidential bid laurie finally ready return acting director brian palma called playing deranged mother sissy spacek carrie first felt script junk decided play role laughs palma chided putting comedic turn scene realize meant film thriller carrie became box office smash launching craze movies teenagers jeopardy spacek laurie nominated academy awards desire act rekindled laurie resumed busy career spanned decades television appeared series matlock murder wrote frasier played george clooneys mother,piper lauri strong will oscar nomin actor perform acclaim role despit one point abandon act altogeth search meaning life die earli saturday home lo angel lauri die old age manag marion rosenberg told associ press via email ad superb talent wonder human lauri arriv hollywood rosetta jacob quickli given contract univers intern new name hate string star role ronald reagan rock hudson toni curti among other went receiv academi award nomin three distinct film poolroom drama hustler film version stephen king horror classic carri romant drama children lesser god also appear sever acclaim role televis stage includ david lynch twin peak villain catherin martel lauri made debut louisa play reagan daughter appear opposit franci talk mule franci goe race made sever film curti date includ princ thief room groom son ali baba johnni dark fed walk week contract vow wouldnt work unless offer decent part move new york found role seek theater live televis drama perform day wine rose deaf heart road led brought emmi nomin pave way return film includ acclaim role paul newman troubl girlfriend hustler mani year lauri turn back act marri film critic joseph morgenstern welcom daughter ann grace move farmhous woodstock new york said later civil right movement vietnam war influenc decis make chang disench look exist meaning recal ad never regret move life full said alway like use hand alway paint lauri also becam note baker recip appear new york time perform time came join dozen musician actor tour colleg campus support senat georg mcgovern presidenti bid lauri final readi return act director brian palma call play derang mother sissi spacek carri first felt script junk decid play role laugh palma chide put comed turn scene realiz meant film thriller carri becam box offic smash launch craze movi teenag jeopardi spacek lauri nomin academi award desir act rekindl lauri resum busi career span decad televis appear seri matlock murder wrote frasier play georg clooney mother
"'Three's Company,' 'Step by Step' actress Suzanne Somers dies at 76",    Somers' career took off after playing the blonde driving the white Thunderbird in George Lucas's 1973 film 'American Graffiti.' She had breast cancer for over 23 years and died on Sunday. ,"Suzanne Somers, the effervescent blonde actor known for playing Chrissy Snow on the television show Three's Company as well as her business endeavors, has died. She was 76.Somers had breast cancer for over 23 years and died on Sunday morning, October 15, her family said in a statement provided by her longtime publicist R. Couri Hay. Her husband Alan Hamel, her son Bruce and other immediate family were with her.""Her family was gathered to celebrate her 77th birthday on October 16th,"" the statement read. ""Instead, they will celebrate her extraordinary life, and want to thank her millions of fans and followers who loved her dearly.""In July, Somers shared on Instagram that her breast cancer had returned. ""Like any cancer patient, when you get that dreaded, 'It's back' you get a pit in your stomach. Then I put on my battle gear and go to war,"" she told Entertainment Tonight at the time. ""This is familiar battleground for me and I'm very tough.""She was first diagnosed in 2000, 2000 2000, and also had skin cancer. She faced some backlash for her reliance on what she's described as a chemical-free and organic lifestyle to combat the cancers. She argued against the use of chemotherapy, in books and on platforms like ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" which drew criticism from the American Cancer Society.Somers was born in 1946 in San Bruno, California, to a gardener father and a medical secretary mother. She began acting in the late 1960s, playing the blonde driving the white Thunderbird in George Lucas's 1973 film American Graffiti. Her only line was mouthing the words ""I love you"" to Richard Dreyfuss's character.At her audition, Lucas just asked her if she could drive. She later said that moment ""changed her life forever."" Somers would later stage a one-woman Broadway show entitled The Blonde in the Thunderbird, which drew largely scathing reviews.Somers appeared in many television shows in the 1970s, including The Rockford Files, Starsky and Hutch and The Six Million Dollar Man, but her most famous part came with Three's Company, which aired on ABC from 1977 to 1984 – though her participation ended in 1981.On Three's Company, she was the ditzy blonde opposite John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt in the roommate comedy. In 1980, after four seasons, she asked for a raise from $30,000 an episode to $150,000 an episode, which would have been comparable to what Ritter was getting paid. Hamel, a former television producer, had encouraged the ask.""The show's response was, 'Who do you think you are?'"" Somers told People in 2020. ""They said, 'John Ritter is the star.'""She was soon fired and her character was replaced by two different roommates for the remaining years the show aired. It also led to a rift with her co-stars; They didn't speak for many years. Somers did reconcile with Ritter before his death, and then with DeWitt on her online talk show.But Somers took the break as an opportunity to pursue new avenues, including a Las Vegas act, writing books, hosting a talk show and becoming an entrepreneur.Somers returned to network television in the 1990s, most famously on Step by Step, which aired on ABC's youth-targeted TGIF lineup. The network also aired a biopic of her life, starring her, called Keeping Secrets.",Obituaries,suzanne somers effervescent blonde actor known playing chrissy snow television show threes company well business endeavors died somers breast cancer years died sunday morning october family said statement provided longtime publicist couri hay husband alan hamel son bruce immediate family family gathered celebrate birthday october statement read instead celebrate extraordinary life want thank millions fans followers loved dearly july somers shared instagram breast cancer returned like cancer patient get dreaded back get pit stomach put battle gear war told entertainment tonight time familiar battleground tough first diagnosed also skin cancer faced backlash reliance shes described chemical free organic lifestyle combat cancers argued use chemotherapy books platforms like oprah winfrey show drew criticism american cancer society somers born san bruno california gardener father medical secretary mother began acting late playing blonde driving white thunderbird george lucass film american graffiti line mouthing words love richard dreyfusss character audition lucas asked could drive later said moment changed life forever somers would later stage one woman broadway show entitled blonde thunderbird drew largely scathing reviews somers appeared many television shows including rockford files starsky hutch six million dollar man famous part came threes company aired abc though participation ended threes company ditzy blonde opposite john ritter joyce dewitt roommate comedy four seasons asked raise episode episode would comparable ritter getting paid hamel former television producer encouraged ask shows response think somers told people said john ritter star soon fired character replaced two different roommates remaining years show aired also led rift stars didnt speak many years somers reconcile ritter death dewitt online talk show somers took break opportunity pursue new avenues including las vegas act writing books hosting talk show becoming entrepreneur somers returned network television famously step step aired abcs youth targeted tgif lineup network also aired bio life starring called keeping secrets,suzann somer effervesc blond actor known play chrissi snow televis show three compani well busi endeavor die somer breast cancer year die sunday morn octob famili said statement provid longtim publicist couri hay husband alan hamel son bruce immedi famili famili gather celebr birthday octob statement read instead celebr extraordinari life want thank million fan follow love dearli juli somer share instagram breast cancer return like cancer patient get dread back get pit stomach put battl gear war told entertain tonight time familiar battleground tough first diagnos also skin cancer face backlash relianc she describ chemic free organ lifestyl combat cancer argu use chemotherapi book platform like oprah winfrey show drew critic american cancer societi somer born san bruno california garden father medic secretari mother began act late play blond drive white thunderbird georg lucass film american graffiti line mouth word love richard dreyfusss charact audit luca ask could drive later said moment chang life forev somer would later stage one woman broadway show entitl blond thunderbird drew larg scath review somer appear mani televis show includ rockford file starski hutch six million dollar man famou part came three compani air abc though particip end three compani ditzi blond opposit john ritter joyc dewitt roommat comedi four season ask rais episod episod would compar ritter get paid hamel former televis produc encourag ask show respons think somer told peopl said john ritter star soon fire charact replac two differ roommat remain year show air also led rift star didnt speak mani year somer reconcil ritter death dewitt onlin talk show somer took break opportun pursu new avenu includ la vega act write book host talk show becom entrepreneur somer return network televis famous step step air abc youth target tgif lineup network also air bio life star call keep secret
Former Finnish president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari dies aged 86,"    The global peace broker was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008 for his work to resolve violent conflicts in countries including Kosovo, Serbia and Northern Ireland. ","Martti Ahtisaari, the former president of Finland and global peace broker awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008 for his work to resolve international conflicts, died Monday. He was 86.The foundation he created for preventing and resolving violent conflicts said in a statement it was ""deeply saddened by the loss of its founder and chair of board.""""It is with great sadness that we have received the news of the death of President Martti Ahtisaari,"" Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö said in a statement. ""He was president in times of change, who piloted Finland into a global EU era."" In 2021, it was announced that Ahtisaari had advanced Alzheimer’s disease.Among his most notable achievements, Ahtisaari helped reach peace accords related to Serbia's withdrawal from Kosovo in the late 1990s, Namibia’s bid for independence in the 1980s, and autonomy for Aceh province in Indonesia in 2005. He was also involved with the Northern Ireland peace process in the late 1990s, being tasked with monitoring the terrorist group IRA's disarmament process.When the Norwegian Nobel Peace Committee picked Ahtisaari in October 2008, it cited him ""for his important efforts, on several continents and over more than three decades, to resolve international conflicts.""Ahtisaari who was the Nordic country's president for one six-year term – 1994 until 2000 – later founded the Helsinki-based Crisis Management Initiative, aimed at preventing and resolving violent conflicts through informal dialogue and mediation.Born June 23, 1937, in the eastern town of Viipuri, which is now in Russia, Ahtisaari was a primary school teacher before joining Finland’s Foreign Ministry in 1965. He spent some 20 years abroad, first as ambassador to Tanzania, Sambia and Somalia and then to the United Nations in New York.After that he joined the UN, working at its New York headquarters, before heading the UN operation that brought independence to Namibia in 1990. Ahtisaari had become deeply involved in activities aimed at preparing Namibians for independence during his diplomatic tenure in Africa in the 1970s.He was appointed as the special representative of Namibia by UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim in 1978, and is widely credited for leading the African nation to independence under his mandate as the head of UN peacekeeping forces there in the late 1980s. The Namibian government was grateful for Ahtisaari’s work and later made him an honorary citizen of the country.After returning to Finland in 1991, Ahtisaari worked as a foreign ministry secretary of state before being elected president in 1994 for a six-year term. He was the first Finnish head of state to be elected directly instead of through an electoral college.Having lived abroad for so long, he came into the race as a political outsider and was seen to bring a breath of fresh air to Finnish politics. Ahtisaari was a keen supporter of the European Union and NATO which Finland joined in 1995 and 2023 respectively.His international highlight came in 1999 when he negotiated – alongside Russia’s Balkans envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin – the end to fighting in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. Ahtisaari also hosted Russian President Boris Yeltsin and US President Bill Clinton at a US-Russia summit in Finnish capital, Helsinki, in March 1997.As president, Ahtisaari traveled abroad more widely than any of his predecessors. At home, he often appeared impatient and vexed by media criticism — he was clearly much more comfortable in international circles.He declined to run for a second term in the January 2000 presidential election, saying he wanted to devote the time he would otherwise have used for campaigning to run the rotating EU presidency, which Finland held for the first time in 1999.After the Finnish presidency, he was offered several international positions, including in the United Nations refugee agency, but decided instead to open his own office in Helsinki which has centered on mediating in international crises.In May 2017, Ahtisaari stepped down as chairman of the Crisis Management Initiative he founded in 2000 to help resolve global conflicts but said he would continue working with the organization as an adviser. He was replaced by former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb who is now running himself to become president.Ahtisaari is survived by his wife Eeva and their adult son. CMI said Ahtisaari will be laid to rest in a state funeral.

The death of American Literature Nobel Prize-winning poet Louise Glück,"    The poet and essayist, considered a major voice in contemporary American poetry, was only recently translated into French. She died on October 13, aged 80. ","Having won a Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for The Wild Iris, she went on to win the prestigious National Book Award for Faithful and Virtuous Night 21 years later, before being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020: American poet Louise Glück died of cancer on Friday, October 13, in Cambridge (Massachusetts). She was 80 years old.Apart from a few sporadic translations in magazines, Louise Glück was virtually unknown in France before her crowning achievement in Stockholm. Nevertheless, she is a major voice in American poetry, celebrated throughout the English-speaking world. On Saturday, October 14, at the 40th Les Ecritures Croisées festival in Aix-en-Provence (southern France), South African writer J. M. Coetzee – the festival's guest of honor – told Le Monde of his long-standing interest in her work. ""I discovered Louise Glück through a photo. It was in a publication called The New American Poets from the 1960s. At the time, all the young American poets looked like hippies, but she, by contrast, seemed classic, reserved. For each author, there were a few lines. I read Glück's and have always followed her since. What struck me was the way in which her poetry went its own way, outside of trends. Unlike her contemporaries, who liked to flaunt their difficulties as poets, hers formed the foundations of her work, without ever being apparent in her art.""Stay the course, simply. This was the motto of this poet, born in New York on April 22, 1943, into a family of Hungarian origins. Little is known about her youth. Taken together, the few descriptions she did give us an idea of her personality, as well as her precocious passion for literature. At the age of five, this shy little girl was able to recite a poem by William Blake by heart. Then it was Shakespeare who enchanted her: she couldn't get enough of the song from Cymbeline. In her teens, she devoured Emily Dickinson (1830-1886), one of her great influences. At the age of 25, after studying at Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University in New York, she published the aptly named Firstborn, her first collection.Glück was undoubtedly influenced by Dickinson. But she insisted she belonged to no group. She didn't identify with any particular tradition. ""I admire Stevens and Dickinson,"" she explained to Po&sie magazine in 1985. ""But I feel other proximities, other debts: Eliot, Williams, Pounds, Oppen, Cavafy, etc."" She also cited Rilke and Sylvia Plath.

"Former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, tireless mediator for peace, has died","    The dedicated elder statesman and diplomat, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008, died on Monday, October 16, in Helsinki. He was 86 years old. ","""Peace is a question of will. All conflicts can be settled, and there are no excuses for allowing them to become eternal,"" said former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari on December 10, 2008, in Oslo, where he had just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless role as a mediator in international conflicts. After suffering from Alzheimer's disease, the diplomat passed away on Monday, October 16, at the age of 86.""Finland has lost a remarkable statesman. Europe, a visionary. And the world, a champion of peace,"" was the reaction from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on the social network X (formerly Twitter), while NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg lauded him as the ""world champion of peace, security and conflict prevention.""In Finland, the news prompted considerable emotion. In a live televised address, President Sauli Niinistö hailed him as ""a great Finn."" Even before his death, he had already been elevated to the ranks of the country's ""great historical figures,"" noted former prime minister Alexander Stubb, who chairs the board of the Crisis Management Initiative, created by Ahtisaari in 2005. Every year on November 10, ""Ahtisaari Day"" is celebrated, promoting peace education and conflict prevention in schools.The displacement of his family ""influenced his vision of the world and his actions. Not by tainting them with bitterness, but by enabling him to understand people's destinies and to know the value of peace,"" noted Niinistö. The son of a non-commissioned officer, Ahtisaari was born in 1937 in Karelia, a province annexed by the USSR during the Second World War. ""I was only two years old when (...) war broke out, forcing my family to leave soon thereafter the town of Viipuri. Like several hundred thousand fellow Karelians, we became refugees in our own country as great power politics caused the borders of Finland to be redrawn and left my hometown as part of the Soviet Union,"" he recounted at the Nobel ceremony.Ahtisaari grew up in Kuopio, central Finland. At 19, he joined the Social Democratic Party, then studied to become a primary school teacher. He only taught for one year. Recruited by a Swedish NGO, he was appointed director of a boarding school in Karachi, Pakistan, where he stayed for three years. Upon his return, he joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the Cooperation Department.His diplomatic career began in 1973. At the age of 36, he was appointed Finland's ambassador to Tanzania. There he discovered the situation in Namibia, which was fighting for independence from South Africa. He took part in the decolonization process, which he would later describe as a ""marathon,"" first as UN envoy for Namibia, then as special representative of the UN Secretary-General, until the country finally gained independence in 1990.",Obituaries,peace question conflicts settled excuses allowing become eternal said former finnish president martti ahtisaari december oslo awarded nobel peace prize tireless role mediator international conflicts suffering alzheimers disease diplomat passed away monday october age finland lost remarkable statesman europe visionary world champion peace reaction european commission president ursula von der leyen social network formerly twitter nato secretary general jens stoltenberg lauded world champion peace security conflict prevention finland news prompted considerable emotion live televised address president sauli niinist hailed great finn even death already elevated ranks countrys great historical figures noted former prime minister alexander stubb chairs board crisis management initiative created ahtisaari every year november ahtisaari day celebrated promoting peace education conflict prevention schools displacement family influenced vision world actions tainting bitterness enabling understand peoples destinies know value peace noted niinist son non commissioned officer ahtisaari born karelia province annexed ussr second world war two years old war broke forcing family leave soon thereafter town viipuri like several hundred thousand fellow karelians became refugees country great power politics caused borders finland redrawn left hometown part soviet union recounted nobel ceremony ahtisaari grew kuopio central finland joined social democratic party studied become primary school teacher taught one year recruited swedish ngo appointed director boarding school karachi pakistan stayed three years upon return joined ministry foreign affairs cooperation department diplomatic career began age appointed finlands ambassador tanzania discovered situation namibia fighting independence south africa took part decolonization process would later describe marathon first envoy namibia special representative secretary general country finally gained independence,peac question conflict settl excus allow becom etern said former finnish presid martti ahtisaari decemb oslo award nobel peac prize tireless role mediat intern conflict suffer alzheim diseas diplomat pass away monday octob age finland lost remark statesman europ visionari world champion peac reaction european commiss presid ursula von der leyen social network formerli twitter nato secretari gener jen stoltenberg laud world champion peac secur conflict prevent finland news prompt consider emot live televis address presid sauli niinist hail great finn even death alreadi elev rank countri great histor figur note former prime minist alexand stubb chair board crisi manag initi creat ahtisaari everi year novemb ahtisaari day celebr promot peac educ conflict prevent school displac famili influenc vision world action taint bitter enabl understand peopl destini know valu peac note niinist son non commiss offic ahtisaari born karelia provinc annex ussr second world war two year old war broke forc famili leav soon thereaft town viipuri like sever hundr thousand fellow karelian becam refuge countri great power polit caus border finland redrawn left hometown part soviet union recount nobel ceremoni ahtisaari grew kuopio central finland join social democrat parti studi becom primari school teacher taught one year recruit swedish ngo appoint director board school karachi pakistan stay three year upon return join ministri foreign affair cooper depart diplomat career began age appoint finland ambassador tanzania discov situat namibia fight independ south africa took part decolon process would later describ marathon first envoy namibia special repres secretari gener countri final gain independ

Both were long-standing club records until they were overtaken by Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney respectively.Charlton won three league three titles and one FA Cup at Old Trafford and, after leaving United in 1973 and becoming Preston manager, he returned to Old Trafford 11 years later as a club director. He was knighted for services to football in 1994.""Manchester United are in mourning following the passing of Sir Bobby Charlton, one of the greatest and most beloved players in the history of our club,"" the Premier League club said in a statement.""Sir Bobby was a hero to millions, not just in Manchester, or the United Kingdom, but wherever football is played around the world.""""He was admired as much for his sportsmanship and integrity as he was for his outstanding qualities as a footballer.

"Richard Roundtree, star of hit 'Shaft' films, dies at 81","    Roundtree's major debut, 'Shaft', was hailed as a seminal classic of the 1970s 'Blaxploitation' genre – which fans say addressed questions of race relations in society. ","American actor Richard Roundtree, heralded as ""the first Black action hero"" for his starring role in the iconic 1971 hit ""Shaft,"" died Tuesday at 81, US media reported. Hollywood publication Deadline said that the actor, known for opening doors for other Black artists in the industry, died with his family at his bedside, ""after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer.""""Shaft,"" in which Roundtree played the eponymous private eye John Shaft, sparked a series of sequels and a TV spinoff. Five decades later, Roundtree was still acting, appearing in the television romance drama ""Cherish the Day"" and film comedy ""Moving On"" just last year. ""Richard's work and career served as a turning point for African American leading men in film,"" his manager Patrick McMinn said in a statement to Variety. ""The impact he had on the industry cannot be overstated.""Roundtree's major debut, ""Shaft"" was hailed as a founding classic in the ""Blaxploitation"" genre the 1970s were known for – which fans say tackled race relations while critics blast the style for trafficking in stereotypes.

Oscar-nominated actor Burt Young dies at 83,"    The actor, best known for playing Paulie in the 'Rocky' franchise – for which he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor – died on October 8 in Los Angeles. ","Burt Young, the Oscar-nominated actor who played Paulie, the rough-hewn, mumbling-and-grumbling best friend, corner man and brother-in-law to Sylvester Stallone in the Rocky franchise, has died.Young died on October 8 in Los Angeles, his daughter, Anne Morea Steingieser, told the New York Times on Wednesday, October 18. No cause was given. He was 83.Young had roles in acclaimed films and television shows including Chinatown, Once Upon a Time in America and The Sopranos. But he was always best known for playing Paulie Pennino in six Rocky movies. The short, paunchy, balding Young was the sort of actor who always seemed to play middle-aged no matter his age.When Paulie first appears in 1976's Rocky, he's an angry, foul-mouthed meat packer who is abusive to his sister Adrian (Talia Shire), with whom he shares a small apartment in Philadelphia. He berates the shy, meek Adrian for refusing at first to go on a Thanksgiving-night date with his buddy and co-worker Rocky Balboa, and destroys a turkey she has in the oven.The film became a phenomenon, topping the box office for the year and making a star of lead actor and writer Stallone, who paid tribute to Young on Instagram on Wednesday night. Along with a photo of the two of them on the set of the first film, Stallone wrote ""you were an incredible man's and artist, I and the World will miss you very much.""Rocky was nominated for 10 Oscars, including best supporting actor for Young. It won three, including best picture. Young and co-star Burgess Meredith, who was also nominated, lost to Jason Robards in All the President's Men.As the movies went on, Young's Paulie softened, as the sequels themselves did, and he became their comic relief. In 1985's ""Rocky IV"" he reprograms a robot Rocky gives him into a sexy-voiced servant who dotes on him. Paulie was also an eternal pessimist who was constantly convinced that Rocky was going to get clobbered by his increasingly daunting opponents. His surprise at Rocky’s resilience brought big laughs. ""It was a great ride, and it brought me to the audience in a great way,"" Young said in a 2020 interview with Celebrity Parents magazine. ""I made him a rough guy with a sensitivity. He’s really a marshmallow even though he yells a lot.""Born and raised in Queens, New York, Young served in the Marine Corps, fought as a professional boxer and worked as a carpet layer before taking up acting, studying with legendary teacher Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. On stage, in films and on television, he typically played small-time tough guys or down-on-their-luck working-class men.In a short but memorable scene in 1974's Chinatown, he plays a fisherman who throws a fit when Jack Nicholson's private detective Jake Gittes shows him pictures proving his wife is cheating on him. Young also appeared in director Sergio Leone's 1984 gangster epic Once Upon a Time in America with Robert De Niro, the 1986 comedy Back to School with Rodney Dangerfield, and the 1989 gritty drama Last Exit to Brooklyn with Jennifer Jason Leigh.In a striking appearance in season three of The Sopranos in 2001, he plays Bobby Baccalieri, Sr., an elderly mafioso with lung cancer who pulls off one last hit before a coughing fit leads to him dying in a car accident. He guest-starred on many other TV series including M*A*S*H, Miami Vice and The Equalizer. Later in life, he focused on roles in the theater and on painting, a lifelong pursuit that led to gallery shows and sales.His wife of 13 years, Gloria, died in 1974.

Former Chinese premier Li Keqiang dies of heart attack at 68,"    Li, a reform-minded bureaucrat, was considered a contender to succeed then-Communist Party leader Hu Jintao in 2013 but was passed over in favor of Xi Jinping, under whom he served as premier for 10 years. ","Former Chinese premier Li Keqiang has died after suffering a heart attack at the age of 68, state media reported Friday, October 27. A reform-minded bureaucrat, Li was once tipped as the country's future leader only to be eclipsed by President Xi Jinping, under whom he served as premier for 10 years. Xinhua news agency said Li had a sudden heart attack on Thursday and passed away in the early hours of Friday in Shanghai, where he had been resting.During his time as premier, Li cultivated an image as a more modern apparatchik compared to his stiffer colleagues. A career bureaucrat who spoke fluent English, he had voiced support for economic reforms during his time in office. He showed liberal tendencies in his youth but toed the party line for decades, and his reputation was damaged by his handling of an HIV/AIDS epidemic stemming from a tainted blood donation program while he was party boss in Henan province. Local authorities responded with a clampdown on activists and the media rather than assigning responsibility to the officials involved, and at the national level a stream of health scandals also happened on his watch.Li, the son of a minor party official in eastern China's poor Anhui province, was sent to the countryside to work as a manual laborer during China's tumultuous Cultural Revolution. He went on to gain a law degree from Peking University, where classmates say he embraced Western and liberal political theory, translating a book on the law by a British judge. But he became more orthodox after joining the ranks of officialdom in the mid-80s, working as a bureaucrat while his former classmates protested in Tiananmen Square in 1989.Li rose to become the party's top official in Henan, and in Liaoning province in the northeast – both of which saw economic growth – before being promoted to become a deputy to then-premier Wen Jiabao. But his attempts at tackling China's deep economic challenges were curtailed by the overwhelming authority of Xi Jinping, with whom he was once seen as a rival for the country's leadership.Li was praised for helping to steer the country through the global financial crisis relatively unscathed. But his time in office saw a dramatic shift in power in China from the more consensus-based rule associated with former leader Hu Jintao and his predecessors to the more concentrated power of Xi. It also saw China's economy begin to slow from the dizzying heights experienced in the 1990s and 2000s.When Li left office, the Chinese economy was experiencing some of its lowest growth in decades, battered by a Covid-induced slowdown and a crisis in the housing market. The appointment of Xi ally Li Qiang – a former Shanghai party boss – as his successor this year was seen as a sign that his reformist agenda had fallen by the wayside as Beijing tightens its grip over its slowing economy.But in his final speech as outgoing premier, Li struck a bullish tone, saying China's economy was ""staging a steady recovery and demonstrating vast potential and momentum for further growth"". ""Overcoming great difficulties and challenges, we succeeded in maintaining overall stable economic performance."" ""There was always a feeling that Li was the last bastion of reason and heart in an otherwise ideological age,"" historian Jeremiah Jenne said in a post on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.",Obituaries,former chinese premier keqiang died suffering heart attack age state media reported friday october reform minded bureaucrat tipped countrys future leader eclipsed president jinping served premier years xinhua news agency said sudden heart attack thursday passed away early hours friday shanghai resting time premier cultivated image modern apparatchik compared stiffer colleagues career bureaucrat spoke fluent english voiced support economic reforms time office showed liberal tendencies youth toed party line decades reputation damaged handling hiv aids epidemic stemming tainted blood donation program party boss henan province local authorities responded clampdown activists media rather assigning responsibility officials involved national level stream health scandals also happened watch son minor party official eastern chinas poor anhui province sent countryside work manual laborer chinas tumultuous cultural revolution went gain law degree peking university classmates say embraced western liberal political theory translating book law british judge became orthodox joining ranks officialdom mid working bureaucrat former classmates protested tiananmen square rose become partys top official henan liaoning province northeast saw economic growth promoted become deputy premier wen jiabao attempts tackling chinas deep economic challenges curtailed overwhelming authority jinping seen rival countrys leadership praised helping steer country global financial crisis relatively unscathed time office saw dramatic shift power china consensus based rule associated former leader jintao predecessors concentrated power also saw chinas economy begin slow dizzying heights experienced left office chinese economy experiencing lowest growth decades battered covid induced slowdown crisis housing market appointment ally qiang former shanghai party boss successor year seen sign reformist agenda fallen wayside beijing tightens grip slowing economy final speech outgoing premier struck bullish tone saying chinas economy staging steady recovery demonstrating vast potential momentum growth overcoming great difficulties challenges succeeded maintaining overall stable economic performance always feeling last bastion reason heart otherwise ideological age historian jeremiah jenne said post social media platform formerly twitter,former chines premier keqiang die suffer heart attack age state media report friday octob reform mind bureaucrat tip countri futur leader eclips presid jinp serv premier year xinhua news agenc said sudden heart attack thursday pass away earli hour friday shanghai rest time premier cultiv imag modern apparatchik compar stiffer colleagu career bureaucrat spoke fluent english voic support econom reform time offic show liber tendenc youth to parti line decad reput damag handl hiv aid epidem stem taint blood donat program parti boss henan provinc local author respond clampdown activist media rather assign respons offici involv nation level stream health scandal also happen watch son minor parti offici eastern china poor anhui provinc sent countrysid work manual labor china tumultu cultur revolut went gain law degre peke univers classmat say embrac western liber polit theori translat book law british judg becam orthodox join rank officialdom mid work bureaucrat former classmat protest tiananmen squar rose becom parti top offici henan liaon provinc northeast saw econom growth promot becom deputi premier wen jiabao attempt tackl china deep econom challeng curtail overwhelm author jinp seen rival countri leadership prais help steer countri global financi crisi rel unscath time offic saw dramat shift power china consensu base rule associ former leader jintao predecessor concentr power also saw china economi begin slow dizzi height experienc left offic chines economi experienc lowest growth decad batter covid induc slowdown crisi hous market appoint alli qiang former shanghai parti boss successor year seen sign reformist agenda fallen waysid beij tighten grip slow economi final speech outgo premier struck bullish tone say china economi stage steadi recoveri demonstr vast potenti momentum growth overcom great difficulti challeng succeed maintain overal stabl econom perform alway feel last bastion reason heart otherwis ideolog age historian jeremiah jenn said post social media platform formerli twitter
"Matthew Perry, elegy for a sad clown","The actor, who died on October 28, was the most constructed and endearing character in the cult series 'Friends'.","With the exception of James Michael Tyler (Gunther, the Central Perk barista), who died prematurely of cancer in 2021, Matthew Perry is the first ""friend"" to go, also ahead of his time. Above all, he is the first of the core gang of six, and the emotion that tinges the tributes paid in the media and on the networks speaks volumes about the sympathy that the character Chandler Bing and the actor who personified him continued to elicit. Perry's death on Saturday, October 28, in a way brings the series to a close, almost 20 years after its last episode. Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Joey and Chandler will never be seen together again.The circumstances of his death, while still obscure, hint at a body giving out after much struggle. Audiences realised the extent of the actor's physical deterioration during his participation in the Friends: The Reunion program organized in 2021, although, at the time of recording, Perry had been sober for 18 months. Everyone knew he wasn't well, his state of health filled the pages of celebrity magazines, but to this extent? Opiates, heroin, alcohol. Leafing through the memoirs he wrote – alone, which is rare in the entertainment business – and published in 2022, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, you could be forgiven for wondering above all how he managed to live to 54 on such a regime.Of the six Friends,  Perry's performance was undoubtedly the most immersive. And to say that he never inhabited a role as fully as Chandler Bing's is no slight to him. Especially since this character of a sarcastic financier, clumsy in love, precursor of the cringe and full of strange behaviors (who could possibly forget his habit of dancing every time something important happens to him?), had everything to be less lovable than Joey (Matt LeBlanc), the idiot heartthrob, or Ross (David Schwimmer), the uptight paleontologist.

'Friends' actor Matthew Perry dies aged 54,"    The actor was found dead of an apparent drowning at his Los Angeles home Saturday, according to the Los Angeles Times and celebrity website TMZ. ","Friends star Matthew Perry, the Emmy-nominated actor whose sarcastic, but lovable Chandler Bing was among television’s most famous and most quotable characters, has died at 54.The actor was found dead of an apparent drowning at his Los Angeles home on Saturday, October 28, according to the Los Angeles Times and celebrity website TMZ , which was the first to report the news. Both outlets cited unnamed sources confirming Perry's death.""Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of the Warner Bros. Television Group family,"" the company said in a statement. ""The impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many. This is a heartbreaking day, and we send our love to his family, his loved ones, and all of his devoted fans.""Asked to confirm police response to what was listed as Perry’s home address, LAPD Officer Drake Madison told the AP that officers had gone to that block ""for a death investigation of a male in his 50s.""Perry's 10 seasons on Friends made him one of Hollywood's most recognizable actors, starring opposite Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer as a friend group in New York. As Chandler, he played the quick-witted, insecure and neurotic roommate of LeBlanc's Joey and a close friend of Schwimmer's Ross.Perry had battled for years with addiction to painkillers and alcohol, and attended rehabilitation clinics on multiple occasions. He was open about it, writing at the beginning of his 2022 million-selling memoir: ""Hi, my name is Matthew, although you may know me by another name. My friends call me Matty. And I should be dead.""Friends ran from 1994 until 2004, winning one best comedy series Emmy Award in 2002. The cast notably banded together for later seasons to obtain a salary of $1 million per episode for each. The series was one of television’s biggest hits and has taken on a new life – and found surprising popularity with younger fans – in recent years on streaming services.Perry described reading the Friends script for the first time in his memoir, Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing. ""It was as if someone had followed me around for a year, stealing my jokes, copying my mannerisms, photocopying my world-weary yet witty view of life. One character in particular stood out to me: it wasn’t that I was thought I could ‘play’ Chandler. I ‘was’ Chandler.""Unknown at the time was the struggle Perry had with addiction and an intense desire to please audiences. ""Friends was huge. I couldn’t jeopardize that. I loved the script. I loved my co-actors. I loved the scripts. I loved everything about the show but I was struggling with my addictions which only added to my sense of shame,"" he wrote in his memoir.""I had a secret and no one could know."" ""I felt like I was gonna die if the live audience didn’t laugh, and that’s not healthy for sure. But I could sometimes say a line and the audience wouldn’t laugh and I would sweat and sometimes go into convulsions,"" Perry wrote. ""If I didn’t get the laugh I was supposed to get I would freak out. I felt that every single night. This pressure left me in a bad place. I also knew of the six people making that show, only one of them was sick.""Perry received one Emmy nomination for his Friends role and two more for appearances as an associate White House counsel on The West Wing. Perry also had several notable film roles, starring opposite Salma Hayek in the rom-com Fools Rush In and Bruce Willis in the the crime comedy The Whole Nine Yards. He worked consistently after Friends, though never in a role that brought him as much attention or acclaim.",Obituaries,friends star matthew perry emmy nominated actor whose sarcastic lovable chandler bing among television famous quotable characters died actor found dead apparent drowning los angeles home saturday october according los angeles times celebrity website tmz first report news outlets cited unnamed sources confirming perrys death matthew incredibly gifted actor indelible part warner bros television group family company said statement impact comedic genius felt around world legacy live hearts many heartbreaking day send love family loved ones devoted fans asked confirm police response listed perry home address lapd officer drake madison told officers gone block death investigation male perrys seasons friends made one hollywoods recognizable actors starring opposite jennifer aniston courteney cox matt leblanc lisa kudrow david schwimmer friend group new york chandler played quick witted insecure neurotic roommate leblancs joey close friend schwimmers ross perry battled years addiction painkillers alcohol attended rehabilitation clinics multiple occasions open writing beginning million selling memoir name matthew although may know another name friends call matty dead friends ran winning one best comedy series emmy award cast notably banded together later seasons obtain salary million per episode series one television biggest hits taken new life found surprising popularity younger fans recent years streaming services perry described reading friends script first time memoir friends lovers big terrible thing someone followed around year stealing jokes copying mannerisms photocopying world weary yet witty view life one character particular stood thought could play chandler chandler unknown time struggle perry addiction intense desire please audiences friends huge jeopardize loved script loved actors loved scripts loved everything show struggling addictions added sense shame wrote memoir secret one could know felt like gon die live audience laugh healthy sure could sometimes say line audience laugh would sweat sometimes convulsions perry wrote get laugh supposed get would freak felt every single night pressure left bad place also knew six people making show one sick perry received one emmy nomination friends role two appearances associate white house counsel west wing perry also several notable film roles starring opposite salma hayek rom com fools rush bruce willis crime comedy whole nine yards worked consistently friends though never role brought much attention acclaim,friend star matthew perri emmi nomin actor whose sarcast lovabl chandler bing among televis famou quotabl charact die actor found dead appar drown lo angel home saturday octob accord lo angel time celebr websit tmz first report news outlet cite unnam sourc confirm perri death matthew incred gift actor indel part warner bro televis group famili compani said statement impact comed geniu felt around world legaci live heart mani heartbreak day send love famili love one devot fan ask confirm polic respons list perri home address lapd offic drake madison told offic gone block death investig male perri season friend made one hollywood recogniz actor star opposit jennif aniston courteney cox matt leblanc lisa kudrow david schwimmer friend group new york chandler play quick wit insecur neurot roommat leblanc joey close friend schwimmer ross perri battl year addict painkil alcohol attend rehabilit clinic multipl occas open write begin million sell memoir name matthew although may know anoth name friend call matti dead friend ran win one best comedi seri emmi award cast notabl band togeth later season obtain salari million per episod seri one televis biggest hit taken new life found surpris popular younger fan recent year stream servic perri describ read friend script first time memoir friend lover big terribl thing someon follow around year steal joke copi manner photocopi world weari yet witti view life one charact particular stood thought could play chandler chandler unknown time struggl perri addict intens desir pleas audienc friend huge jeopard love script love actor love script love everyth show struggl addict ad sens shame wrote memoir secret one could know felt like gon die live audienc laugh healthi sure could sometim say line audienc laugh would sweat sometim convuls perri wrote get laugh suppos get would freak felt everi singl night pressur left bad place also knew six peopl make show one sick perri receiv one emmi nomin friend role two appear associ white hous counsel west wing perri also sever notabl film role star opposit salma hayek rom com fool rush bruce willi crime comedi whole nine yard work consist friend though never role brought much attent acclaim
Macron hosts religious leaders to discuss fight against anti-Semitism,"    The French president met with leaders from several faiths one day after a large march 'for the republic and against anti-Semitism,' which he did not attend. ","President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, November 13, hosted religious leaders for talks on combatting anti-Semitism in France, a day after a Paris march rallied tens of thousands to express anxiety over an upsurge in acts against Jews. There have been growing tensions in France, home to large Muslim and Jewish communities, as war rages in the Gaza Strip between the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel.Monday's talks were a ""continuation of the appeal for national unity and brotherhood"" Macron had made in a letter published on Saturday in the newspaper Le Parisien, Macron wrote that ""a France where our Jewish fellow citizens are afraid is not France,"" calling on people to rally around the country's ""values"" and ""universalism.""The country has seen an upsurge in anti-Semitic acts since Hamas's bloody October 7 attack on Israel killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and Israel's response in the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has claimed more than 11,000 lives, mostly civilians and many of them children.While the presidency did not specify who had been invited to Monday's meeting, France's chief rabbi Haïm Korsia, Catholic bishops' conference head Eric de Moulins-Beaufort and rector of the Paris Grand Mosque Chems-Eddine Hafiz were all present. Leaders from other faiths including the Orthodox church, Buddhism and Protestantism were also in attendance.Macron had urged the religious leaders to make an ""educational effort to increase the number of measures addressed to young people,"" Catholic bishops' conference head Eric de Moulins-Beaufort told reporters after the meeting.""The president's aim, which of course we will help pass on, is to spread this message,"" said Elie Korchia, president of France's Central Israelite Consistory. ""Many young people no longer necessarily read the press, no longer watch TV, sometimes they're shut up in a language of their own, without reaching out to others,"" he added.Sunday's march ""should have been made into a battle against racism, that was important,"" Hafiz said, arguing that as well as ""a real increase in anti-Semitism,"" France has seen ""an outburst of remarks made against Muslims."" Nevertheless, ""I don't want to get into a victimhood contest,"" he added.Over 180,000 people turned out across France on Sunday according to police figures, 105,000 of them in Paris, to join marches ""for the republic and against anti-Semitism."" Macron himself has been criticized for staying away from the march.Jordan Bardella, head of the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) – which controversially joined the column – told broadcaster RTL on Monday that the president had ""missed a rendezvous with history.""Sylvain Maillard, leader of Macron's party's Assemblée Nationale group, defended the president, telling Sud Radio that ""a president's place isn't at a demonstration.""Macron ""will be judged on how effective state action against anti-Semitism is, rather than his presence at the head of a one-day demonstration,"" political commentator Guillaume Tabard wrote in the conservative daily Le Figaro.Macron has also been rebuked by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after criticizing Israel's extensive bombing campaign in Gaza in a weekend interview with the BBC. ""Civilians are bombed... these babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed... there is no reason for that and no legitimacy. So we do urge Israel to stop,"" he said.The French leader's office said late Sunday that he had spoken with Israeli President Isaac Herzog by phone in an apparent bid to calm the waters.Macron ""again expressed his solidarity with Israel in the face of the horror of the terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas"" and ""reiterated Israel's right to defend itself and repeated France's solidarity with

"With the death of Matthew Perry, 'Friends' loses its Chandler Bing","    Deliberately funny and ironic about his own weaknesses, weakened by his addictions to alcohol and painkillers, the actor marked the iconic sitcom with his impeccable sense of comic timing. He died on October 28 at the age of 54. ","Matthew Perry appeared in 14 feature films, 33 series and 14 TV movies between 1979 and 2017. But in the eyes of the world, the career of Perry, who was found dead in his jacuzzi in California's Beverly Hills on Sunday, October 28, at the age of 54, could be summed up in two words: Chandler Bing. Over the course of 236 episodes of Friends, hundreds of millions of viewers accompanied him as he transformed from a dynamic, sarcastic, insecure young executive into a good family man ready to leave Manhattan for the suburbs.But, at the same time as Friends was making it to be one of the biggest series in the world, Perry was sinking into addiction, first to alcohol, then to painkillers, involving multiple stays in rehabs. He retraced this path in his autobiography, Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing, published at the end of 2022. The actor had come close to death in 2018, suffering from pancreatitis whose side effects had plunged him into a coma.Perry was born on August 19, 1969 in Williamstown, Massachusetts. His father, John Bennett Perry, is an actor, while his mother, Suzanne Marie Morrison, is a Canadian journalist who worked with former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, father of Justin. Perry's parents separated shortly after his birth, and Perry grew up in Canada, where he developed a passion for tennis. At the age of 15, he joined his father in Los Angeles.As a high-school student, he embarked on an acting career, appearing in a number of series for one episode at a time. In 1988, after finishing high school, he landed his first recurring role, that of a high-school student in Boys Will Be Boys. The series was cancelled after one season. Until 1994, Perry appeared for a few episodes in a number of different successful series (Who's the Boss? Beverly Hills 90210). In the spring of 1993, his luck seemed to change when he landed the lead role, that of an irresponsible young man who still lives with his mother, in Home Free, a family sitcom programmed on Friday nights on ABC, one of the three major American networks. But the series was a flop with the public and went off the air after 13 episodes.In 1991, Perry starred in an episode of Dream On, a series created by David Crane and Martha Kauffman. Three years later, the duo sold their new project, Insomnia Cafe which followed the tribulations of six friends as they enter adulthood together in Manhattan, to the Warner Bros. television subsidiary. NBC then acquired Insomnia Cafe now Friends, which the network planned to air on prime time Thursday evenings. After auditioning, Perry landed the role of Chandler Bing, which he would play for almost 10 years, from September 22, 1994, when the first episode of Friends aired, to May 10, 2004, a dark day for millions of fans, deprived of their weekly dose of friendship and romance.",Obituaries,matthew perry appeared feature films series movies eyes world career perry found dead jacuzzi californias beverly hills sunday october age could summed two words chandler bing course episodes friends hundreds millions viewers accompanied transformed dynamic sarcastic insecure young executive good family man ready leave manhattan suburbs time friends making one biggest series world perry sinking addiction first alcohol painkillers involving multiple stays rehabs retraced path autobiography friends lovers big terrible thing published end actor come close death suffering pancreatitis whose side effects plunged coma perry born august williamstown massachusetts father john bennett perry actor mother suzanne marie morrison canadian journalist worked former prime minister pierre trudeau father justin perrys parents separated shortly birth perry grew canada developed passion tennis age joined father los angeles high school student embarked acting career appearing number series one episode time finishing high school landed first recurring role high school student boys boys series cancelled one season perry appeared episodes number different successful series whos boss beverly hills spring luck seemed change landed lead role irresponsible young man still lives mother home free family sitcom programmed friday nights abc one three major american networks series flop public went air episodes perry starred episode dream series created david crane martha kauffman three years later duo sold new project insomnia cafe followed tribulations six friends enter adulthood together manhattan warner bros television subsidiary nbc acquired insomnia cafe friends network planned air prime time thursday evenings auditioning perry landed role chandler bing would play almost years september first episode friends aired may dark day millions fans deprived weekly dose friendship romance,matthew perri appear featur film seri movi eye world career perri found dead jacuzzi california beverli hill sunday octob age could sum two word chandler bing cours episod friend hundr million viewer accompani transform dynam sarcast insecur young execut good famili man readi leav manhattan suburb time friend make one biggest seri world perri sink addict first alcohol painkil involv multipl stay rehab retrac path autobiographi friend lover big terribl thing publish end actor come close death suffer pancreat whose side effect plung coma perri born august williamstown massachusett father john bennett perri actor mother suzann mari morrison canadian journalist work former prime minist pierr trudeau father justin perri parent separ shortli birth perri grew canada develop passion tenni age join father lo angel high school student embark act career appear number seri one episod time finish high school land first recur role high school student boy boy seri cancel one season perri appear episod number differ success seri who boss beverli hill spring luck seem chang land lead role irrespons young man still live mother home free famili sitcom program friday night abc one three major american network seri flop public went air episod perri star episod dream seri creat david crane martha kauffman three year later duo sold new project insomnia cafe follow tribul six friend enter adulthood togeth manhattan warner bro televis subsidiari nbc acquir insomnia cafe friend network plan air prime time thursday even audit perri land role chandler bing would play almost year septemb first episod friend air may dark day million fan depriv weekli dose friendship romanc
Israel-Hamas war: French tourist bookings to Jordan and Egypt plummet,"    In October, French tourism professionals reported a drop in vacation reservations of up to 80% compared to 2022 over the same holiday period for the destinations closest to the Gaza Strip. ","Since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, Egypt's pyramids, Nile cruises and temples, as well as Jordan's desert, had been enjoying a resurgence in French tourism. In October, though, these two destinations closest to the Gaza Strip quickly came to a halt. ""It's very simple,"" summarized Raouf Ben Slimane, founder of Thalasso no. 1 and Ôvoyages. ""Over the past 10 days or so, as the crisis has intensified, we've seen cancellations and, above all, a real drop in bookings (in the order of 80% compared to 2022 over the same period) for these two countries close to the conflict zone,"" he pointed out, adding that of his 335,000 annual customers, 10,000 travel to these two countries. ""Tourists haven't been flocking to these destinations for over two weeks now,"" confirmed Stéphane Nicolas, Selectour's director of network development, who said he is hoping for ""deferrals"" to other destinations.""Obviously, we are not expecting Jordan to be a roaring success this year,"" admitted Guillaume Linton, CEO of the tour operator Asia Voyages, which has already seen a 60% drop in bookings for the country over the past three weeks, compared with those made in September.As far as cancellations of already-purchased trips, the trend is less pronounced. ""From All Saints' Day [November 1] to the end of December, it was 10%,"" said Linton, who is also counting on a fallback effect toward countries such as India, Thailand and Vietnam. ""We see all sorts of things,"" added Helmut Stuckelschweiger, head of Top of Travel, one of Jordan's leading travel agencies. ""On Tuesday, October 24, a couple was due to leave from Pau for Amman, but the husband refused to board, and his wife left without him.""""During the All Saints' Day vacations, people who had booked a trip to Egypt are going, including those with children,"" said Bruno Abenin, sales director at Travel Evasion. Over the whole of 2023, the number of Egyptian holidays sold by his company is still set to beat a record set over 15 years ago, with 30,000 customers visiting there. But the boom came to an abrupt halt since the murder of French teacher Dominique Bernard in Arras, and the climate of anxiety that followed the airport bomb scares. ""People are taking a wait-and-see attitude,"" he said, noting that since those events, ""sales have cooled"" and that bookings to Egypt for departures in April 2024 have dropped by around 40%.In Israel, which received over 3 million visitors in the first nine months of the year (including 800,000 Americans), there was, not surprisingly, a severe decline in the number of tourists from October 7 onward. Several tour operators and cruise lines have canceled all their trips or stopovers until at least early 2024. The streets of Jerusalem and Bethlehem, which have always been extremely popular with travelers, now stand empty.",Sports,since end covid pandemic egypts pyramids nile cruises temples well jordans desert enjoying resurgence french tourism october though two destinations closest gaza strip quickly came halt simple summarized raouf ben slimane founder thalasso voyages past days crisis intensified weve seen cancellations real drop bookings order compared period two countries close conflict zone pointed adding annual customers travel two countries tourists havent flocking destinations two weeks confirmed phane nicolas selectours director network development said hoping deferrals destinations obviously expecting jordan roaring success year admitted guillaume linton ceo tour operator asia voyages already seen drop bookings country past three weeks compared made september far cancellations already purchased trips trend less pronounced saints day november end december said linton also counting fallback effect toward countries india thailand vietnam see sorts things added helmut stuckelschweiger head top travel one jordans leading travel agencies tuesday october couple due leave pau amman husband refused board wife left without saints day vacations people booked trip egypt going including children said bruno abenin sales director travel evasion whole number egyptian holidays sold company still set beat record set years ago customers visiting boom came abrupt halt since murder french teacher dominique bernard arras climate anxiety followed airport bomb scares people taking wait see attitude said noting since events sales cooled bookings egypt departures april dropped around israel received million visitors first nine months year including americans surprisingly severe decline number tourists october onward several tour operators cruise lines canceled trips stopovers least early streets jerusalem bethlehem always extremely popular travelers stand empty,sinc end covid pandem egypt pyramid nile cruis templ well jordan desert enjoy resurg french tourism octob though two destin closest gaza strip quickli came halt simpl summar raouf ben sliman founder thalasso voyag past day crisi intensifi weve seen cancel real drop book order compar period two countri close conflict zone point ad annual custom travel two countri tourist havent flock destin two week confirm phane nicola selectour director network develop said hope deferr destin obvious expect jordan roar success year admit guillaum linton ceo tour oper asia voyag alreadi seen drop book countri past three week compar made septemb far cancel alreadi purchas trip trend less pronounc saint day novemb end decemb said linton also count fallback effect toward countri india thailand vietnam see sort thing ad helmut stuckelschweig head top travel one jordan lead travel agenc tuesday octob coupl due leav pau amman husband refus board wife left without saint day vacat peopl book trip egypt go includ children said bruno abenin sale director travel evas whole number egyptian holiday sold compani still set beat record set year ago custom visit boom came abrupt halt sinc murder french teacher dominiqu bernard arra climat anxieti follow airport bomb scare peopl take wait see attitud said note sinc event sale cool book egypt departur april drop around israel receiv million visitor first nine month year includ american surprisingli sever declin number tourist octob onward sever tour oper cruis line cancel trip stopov least earli street jerusalem bethlehem alway extrem popular travel stand empti
Messi wins eighth Ballon d'Or as Bonmati claims women's award,"    Lionel Messi received the Ballon d'Or from David Beckham, the co-owner of Inter Miami, on Monday. ","Lionel Messi won the eighth Ballon d'Or of his remarkable career at a glittering ceremony in Paris on Monday, October 31, while Spain's World Cup-winning star Aitana Bonmati took the women's prize.For Messi, the trophy rewards, above all else, his inspirational performances at last year's World Cup in Qatar, when he dragged Argentina to victory, scoring seven goals and being named the tournament's best player. It was the crowning moment of his astonishing career, and it allowed him to see off stiff competition, in particular from Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe, to take the award on the stage of the Chatelet Theatre in Paris. It was a return to the French capital after his departure from Paris Saint-Germain in June and his subsequent move to Inter Miami in Major League Soccer.""This is a gift to the whole Argentina team for what we achieved,"" said Messi on stage after receiving his award from David Beckham, the co-owner of Inter Miami. Messi dedicated the trophy to late Argentina legend Diego Maradona, who would have celebrated his 63rd birthday on Monday. ""Happy birthday Diego. This is for you too,"" he said.Messi benefits from a recent change which means the award is based on a player's record over the last season, rather than over the calendar year. He won despite an underwhelming final season at PSG, even if he was a Ligue 1 title winner.Messi is 36 and won his first Ballon d'Or in 2009. With eight, he is now three ahead of his old rival Cristiano Ronaldo, the next most decorated player in the history of the award. It remains to be seen if Messi will again feature in the running for the prize, which is voted for by one journalist in each of the top 100 nations in the FIFA ranking. ""I am not thinking about the long-term future. I am just enjoying the day-to-day at the moment,"" he said.Messi will struggle to hold off the next wave of superstars, led by Mbappe, Haaland and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham, but his World Cup performances made his victory this time feel inevitable.Mbappe was the star player in that team, scoring 41 goals, and was also the World Cup's top scorer with eight goals, including a hat-trick in the final which France lost to Argentina on penalties. Yet he fell just short of the Ballon d'Or, finishing third, while Norway striker Haaland came second after scoring 52 goals in 53 games for the Manchester City team that won the treble of English Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.The women's prize seemed even more clear cut, as Bonmati was rewarded for starring as Spain won the World Cup in Australia in August. The 25-year-old midfielder was named the best player at the World Cup as the Spanish team overcame off-field turbulence, including protests against their national federation and coach Jorge Vilda, to lift the trophy.Bonmati also starred as Barcelona won the Champions League last season and was recently named as the UEFA Women's Player of the Year. ""It is difficult to improve on this. It has been a unique year,"" she told various media. ""If anyone said to me when I was little that I would play at the Camp Nou, win the World Cup, two Champions Leagues, a Ballon d'Or, a UEFA award, these are extraordinary things.""She was one of four members of the triumphant Spain team to feature among the 30 nominees, with Alba Redondo, Salma Paralluelo and full-back Olga Carmona, who netted the winner in the final, all shortlisted.Last year's Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas, also part of that Spain side, was not nominated after missing almost all of last season with a knee injury. Australia's Sam Kerr came second with Paralluelo in third place. Putellas had won the Ballon d'Or in each of the previous two campaigns. Norway's Ada Hegerberg won the inaugural award in 2018 and USA star Megan Rapinoe succeeded her a year later.Bellingham won the Kopa Trophy for the best player of last season aged under 21. The 20-year-old has started his Madrid career with 13 goals in 13 games, although the prize rewards his performances in his final campaign with Borussia Dortmund. Bellingham's Madrid teammate, the Brazil forward Vinicius Junior, won the Socrates prize in recognition of his off-pitch work. Messi's Argentina colleague Emiliano Martinez won the Yashin Trophy for the best goalkeeper of the season.",Sports,lionel messi eighth ballon dor remarkable career glittering ceremony paris monday

"World Cup 2034: After Australia's withdrawal, Saudi Arabia is sole bidder to host the competition","    On Tuesday, the Australian Football Association announced that it was abandoning its bid to host the 2034 World Cup. The Saudi kingdom has never been so close to becoming the tournament's host country. ","While football federations have until 11:59 pm on Tuesday, October 31, to submit their bids to the Fédération Internationale de Football (FIFA) to host the 2034 World Cup, one of them has just withdrawn. Early this morning, the Australian Football Association announced on X (formerly Twitter) that it was officially withdrawing its bid to host the event. ""We have explored the opportunity to bid to host the FIFA World Cup and – having taken all factors into consideration – we have reached the conclusion not to do so for the 2034 competition,"" the federation announced in its press release.At the beginning of October, Australia announced that it was working on a project to host the World Cup. A week later, it had even envisaged a joint ticket with Indonesia. Indonesian FA President Erick Thohir explained that Australia was in favor of a joint bid with his country, following discussions at the last FIFA Congress, held in Rwanda in March.Eventually, after the Indonesian federation changed its position and lent its support to the Saudi bid 10 days ago, Australia decided to throw in the towel. It justified this decision as a desire to concentrate on the organization of the 2026 Women's Asian Cup and the 2029 Club World Cup. The federation added that ""Achieving this – following the FIFA Women's World Cup Australia and New Zealand 2023 and with the Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games – would represent a truly golden decade for Australian football.""Thanks to this withdrawal, Saudi Arabia is now the short odds favorite to host the World Cup. Following the designation, on October 4, of Spain, Morocco and Portugal as hosts of the 2030 edition (with the organization of three matches in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay), FIFA launched a call for bids for the 2034 tournament. By virtue of the principle of continental rotation, the Asian and Oceanic federations were the ones in the running to host this edition.A few minutes after this call, Saudi Arabia, which had already positioned itself to organize the 2030 World Cup, confirmed that it would bid for the 2034 event. The Saudis immediately received the backing of the Asian Football Confederation, making them the clear favorite to organize the competition.Like Qatar in 2022, the country intends to use the World Cup as a powerful soft power tool. In a press release on October 4, the Saudi Arabian Football Federation announced that it ""intends to deliver a world-class tournament and will draw inspiration from Saudi Arabia's ongoing social and economic transformation and the country's deep-rooted passion for football."" Although the suspense is becoming increasingly thin, the host of the 2034 edition is expected to be officially unveiled by FIFA at the end of 2024.",Sports,football federations tuesday october submit bids ration internationale football fifa host world cup one withdrawn early morning australian football association announced formerly twitter officially withdrawing bid host event explored opportunity bid host fifa world cup taken factors consideration reached conclusion competition federation announced press release beginning october australia announced working project host world cup week later even envisaged joint ticket indonesia indonesian president erick thohir explained australia favor joint bid country following discussions last fifa congress held rwanda march eventually indonesian federation changed position lent support saudi bid days ago australia decided throw towel justified decision desire concentrate organization womens asian cup club world cup federation added achieving following fifa womens world cup australia new zealand brisbane olym would represent truly golden decade australian football thanks withdrawal saudi arabia short odds favorite host world cup following designation october spain morocco portugal hosts edition organization three matches uruguay argentina paraguay fifa launched call bids tournament virtue principle continental rotation asian oceanic federations ones running host edition minutes call saudi arabia already positioned organize world cup confirmed would bid event saudis immediately received backing asian football confederation making clear favorite organize competition like qatar country intends use world cup powerful soft power tool press release october saudi arabian football federation announced intends deliver world class tournament draw inspiration saudi arabias ongoing social economic transformation countrys deep rooted passion football although suspense becoming increasingly thin host edition expected officially unveiled fifa end,footbal feder tuesday octob submit bid ration international footbal fifa host world cup one withdrawn earli morn australian footbal associ announc formerli twitter offici withdraw bid host event explor opportun bid host fifa world cup taken factor consider reach conclus competit feder announc press releas begin octob australia announc work project host world cup week later even envisag joint ticket indonesia indonesian presid erick thohir explain australia favor joint bid countri follow discuss last fifa congress held rwanda march eventu indonesian feder chang posit lent support saudi bid day ago australia decid throw towel justifi decis desir concentr organ women asian cup club world cup feder ad achiev follow fifa women world cup australia new zealand brisban olym would repres truli golden decad australian footbal thank withdraw saudi arabia short odd favorit host world cup follow design octob spain morocco portug host edit organ three match uruguay argentina paraguay fifa launch call bid tournament virtu principl continent rotat asian ocean feder one run host edit minut call saudi arabia alreadi posit organ world cup confirm would bid event saudi immedi receiv back asian footbal confeder make clear favorit organ competit like qatar countri intend use world cup power soft power tool press releas octob saudi arabian footbal feder announc intend deliv world class tournament draw inspir saudi arabia ongo social econom transform countri deep root passion footbal although suspens becom increasingli thin host edit expect offici unveil fifa end
"Paris 2024 opening ceremony: Authorities consider admitting around 300,000 spectators for free","    A defense and security council meeting is scheduled for the end of November. The public authorities are finalizing the arrangements for screening, security controls and crowd control. ","The question of the number of spectators who will be able to access the upper quays of the Seine free of charge to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games on July 26, 2024, is expected to be decided at a defense and security council meeting scheduled for late November. The figure currently being discussed by the public authorities is around 300,000 people maximum, according to a source familiar with the discussions.Initially, the project was more ambitious: 100,000 paying spectators on the lower quays and 500,000 on the upper quays would attend the athletes' river parade, planned on barges over a 6-kilometer stretch between the François-Mitterrand Library and the Eiffel Tower.However, some stakeholders such as the Ile-de-France regional government as well as its public transportation authority, had warned of the difficulties and risks that such an influx could entail, particularly in terms of transportation.Back in May, Amélie Oudéa-Castéra, the French Minister for Sport and the Olympic and Paralympic Games, had already suggested a more limited option, with ""roughly 300,000 to 400,000 seats"" free of charge.International tensions (the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Gaza war), as well as the attack in the northern French city of Arras, where a teacher was killed, exacerbated security concerns for an already complex event.Officially, there are currently no plans to ""relocate"" the opening ceremony or to draw up a plan B: ""Plan A takes into account all of the threats,"" the government and the Paris 2024 Organizing Committee have pointed out in recent days.""Are we paying attention to the context? The answer is obviously yes,"" said Oudéa-Castréa on BFM-TV on October 26, explaining that the government is working on ""adjustment variables."" ""It would be irresponsible not to. But we want to keep the idea of this opening ceremony,"" she added.More than the exact number of spectators who will be able to access the upper quays, the issues that concern the authorities, and for which they must provide answers in the coming weeks, are how to manage crowd control and how to position filtering and control points in the right places.Concerning the first point, the protocol signed in May by the French government, the City of Paris and Paris 2024 stipulated that the free access spectators would be ""channeled and put into boxes demarcated with removable barriers,"" with an ""occupancy ratio of 3 people per m2"" – which corresponded roughly to 400,000 to 500,000 people.Despite this compartmentalization, it will be necessary to guard against the possible flow of spectators along the quays. Some might be tempted to move to follow the progress of the river parade. The risk would then be of a greater or lesser influx of people towards the Eiffel Tower and the Trocadéro Palace, where the parade ends, with the risk of the public being pushed and compressed.As far as filtering and control are concerned, the challenge for the authorities is not only to decide where these points are to be installed, but also to define how entrances and, above all, exits are to be managed and secured.For entrances, the online ticketing/reservation system to be set up by the Ministry of the Interior should allow spectators to be directed to the areas allocated to them.Reminders should be sent out beforehand. The first step will be to check that those who have booked tickets have confirmed their attendance – and, if so, that they have taken note of the area they will have to go to, and have been told which metro station to use, given the security perimeter that will be set up.But the other issue, which has been presented as potentially critical, because it is a possible source of tension, is that of exiting these free zones. The show promises to be long (over three hours), and it's not certain that everyone will make it to the end.Since all exits must be final, it will be necessary to plan how to manage possibly replacing those who have exited with others – a priori without tickets – who have waited for space to become available before being able to enter.",Sports,question number spectators able access upper quays

World Cup 2034: FIFA's sleight of hand,"Saudi Arabia, the likely host of the football World Cup in 2034, is benefiting from the increasingly unclear designation process by the sport's governing body, which seems to disregard all environmental priorities and the interests of teams and spectators.","FIFA's announcement, on Tuesday, October 31, that Saudi Arabia was the sole bidder to host the World Cup in 2034, raises multiple questions about the process of designating the host country for one of the most watched sporting events on the planet.The official awarding of the competition is not expected until the end of 2024, but the outcome seems so obvious that it is more of a fait accompli than the open and transparent competition it is supposed to be. The Saudi kingdom became the lone candidate after Australia's withdrawal. With Indonesia backing Saudi Arabia rather than embarking on a joint bid with Australia, the latter apparently felt that the outcome was already clear.For several years now, FIFA has been issuing a series of decisions that have made the process of awarding World Cups increasingly unclear and predetermined. If Australia and Saudi Arabia seemed to be the only countries in the running, it was because, on October 4, FIFA chose to reserve the 2034 World Cup for Asia-Oceania (which includes the Middle East), having awarded the 2030 World Cup to a group of countries across three continents, breaking the tradition of geographical rotation. Spain, Portugal and Morocco will host the 2030 edition, but three matches will be played in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, with the pretext that this will allow Uruguay to celebrate the centenary of the World Cup, first played in that country in 1930. Thanks to this remarkable sleight of hand, the tournament will take place in Europe, Africa and South America, paving the way for Asia-Oceania in 2034.From then on, Saudi Arabia was in pole position. Its leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as ""MBS,"" wants to make the kingdom one of the great centers of international sporting competition of all kinds: golf, boxing, Formula 1 and, of course, football, a sport that is very popular in the country and the Arab world in general. The hosting of world sports championships and the recruitment by local clubs of international football stars such as Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema have become a major soft power asset for the kingdom and a tool for economic diversification, so much so that MBS has been dubbed the ""king of sportswashing.""The autocrat, who is constantly criticized by human rights NGOs, makes no secret of his ambitions: ""If sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by 1%, then we will continue doing sportswashing,"" he recently said to Fox News. ""I am aiming for another 1.5%. Call it whatever you want.""After the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA chief Gianni Infantino carefully cultivated his relationship with MBS. Beyond the legitimate criticism of the nature of the Saudi regime, however, this new controversy requires that Infantino and FIFA, a huge profit machine, provide a much better explanation as to the process behind decisions that promote the construction of air-conditioned stadiums, disrupt the calendars of national competitions, and force teams and fans to increasingly travel from one continent to another.",Sports,fifas announcement tuesday october saudi arabia sole bidder host world cup raises multiple questions process designating host country one watched sporting events planet official awarding competition expected end outcome seems obvious fait accompli open transparent competition supposed saudi kingdom became lone candidate australias withdrawal indonesia backing saudi arabia rather embarking joint bid australia latter apparently felt outcome already clear several years fifa issuing series decisions made process awarding world cups increasingly unclear predetermined australia saudi arabia seemed countries running october fifa chose reserve world cup asia oceania includes middle east awarded world cup group countries across three continents breaking tradition geographical rotation spain portugal morocco host edition three matches played argentina paraguay uruguay pretext allow uruguay celebrate centenary world cup first played country thanks remarkable sleight hand tournament take place europe africa south america paving way asia oceania saudi arabia pole position leader crown prince mohammed bin salman known mbs wants make kingdom one great centers international sporting competition kinds golf boxing formula course football sport popular country arab world general hosting world sports championships recruitment local clubs international football stars neymar cristiano ronaldo karim benzema become major soft power asset kingdom tool economic diversification much mbs dubbed king sportswashing autocrat constantly criticized human rights ngos makes secret ambitions sportswashing going increase gdp continue sportswashing recently said fox news aiming another call whatever want world cup qatar fifa chief gianni infantino carefully cultivated relationship mbs beyond legitimate criticism nature saudi regime however new controversy requires infantino fifa huge profit machine provide much better explanation process behind decisions promote construction air conditioned stadiums disrupt calendars national competitions force teams fans increasingly travel one continent another,fifa announc tuesday octob saudi arabia sole bidder host world cup rais multipl question process design host countri one watch sport event planet offici award competit expect end outcom seem obviou fait accompli open transpar competit suppos saudi kingdom becam lone candid australia withdraw indonesia back saudi arabia rather embark joint bid australia latter appar felt outcom alreadi clear sever year fifa issu seri decis made process award world cup increasingli unclear predetermin australia saudi arabia seem countri run octob fifa chose reserv world cup asia oceania includ middl east award world cup group countri across three contin break tradit geograph rotat spain portug morocco host edit three match play argentina paraguay uruguay pretext allow uruguay celebr centenari world cup first play countri thank remark sleight hand tournament take place europ africa south america pave way asia oceania saudi arabia pole posit leader crown princ moham bin salman known mb want make kingdom one great center intern sport competit kind golf box formula cours footbal sport popular countri arab world gener host world sport championship recruit local club intern footbal star neymar cristiano ronaldo karim benzema becom major soft power asset kingdom tool econom diversif much mb dub king sportswash autocrat constantli critic human right ngo make secret ambit sportswash go increas gdp continu sportswash recent said fox news aim anoth call whatev want world cup qatar fifa chief gianni infantino care cultiv relationship mb beyond legitim critic natur saudi regim howev new controversi requir infantino fifa huge profit machin provid much better explan process behind decis promot construct air condit stadium disrupt calendar nation competit forc team fan increasingli travel one contin anoth
"Paris 2024 Olympics: After the Games, more than 1,600 housing units will go to students","    During the competition, Olympic organizers are hoping to use student residences in the Paris region. ","In September 2024, the Paris Olympic Games will leave a material legacy: Minister of Higher Education Sylvie Retailleau announced in Le Parisien, on October 26 that, after the international competition, 1,667 housing units that will have hosted athletes and journalists during the Paris Olympic Games will be used for student housing. Eighty percent of these units are located in the department of Seine-Saint-Denis, just north of Paris. The remainder will be in Villeneuve-d'Ascq, in the Lille metropolitan area, in northern France.The management of this accommodation will be entrusted to private organizations, notably social housing associations, rather than the regional centers for university and school services (CROUS), the minister's entourage told Le Monde.Will this unexpected news be enough to restore a somewhat tarnished Olympic image among students? In the spring of 2023, the education authorities were asked by the Olympic Games Organizing Committee to free up 3,000 of the 22,000 university units in student residences in the Paris region during the event, pushing the usual tenants out. This initiative was suspended by the Paris Administrative Court, in a decision dated August 31, on the grounds that it was not permissible for CROUS ""to organize the vacancy of these accommodations"" in advance. Only rooms vacant on July 1, 2024, can be rented to the Committee, according to the provisions made in the law of March 26, 2018, relating to preparations for the event.The Paris CROUS has lodged an appeal with the Council of State, which is still pending, as Le Monde learned from the CROUS, which did not wish to give details of the arguments put forward. The Ministry, for its part, considers that the judge has ""not invalidated the principle on its merit, but on its form,"" and asserted that ""everything will be done according to the rules of law.""The minister confirmed that a maximum of 2,200 students will be relocated. Students will be relocated as close as possible to their place of study, and will receive a lump-sum payment of €100. Two tickets to Olympic events will also be offered to each of the students concerned.Two options were possible, as Minister Retailleau's entourage, who would like to ""put an end to the controversy,"" told Le Monde. The first was to distribute the public servants accredited for the Olympics among the 30% of vacant places in the residences during the summer period. ""But this choice meant having these people, who will be living with staggered schedules according to the rhythm of the competitions, cohabiting with students who are taking exams or working in the summer, which is not ideal,"" they said.",Sports,september paris olym leave material legacy minister higher education sylvie retailleau announced parisien october international competition housing units hosted athletes journalists paris olym used student housing eighty percent units located department seine saint denis north paris remainder villeneuve dascq lille metropolitan area northern france management accommodation entrusted private organizations notably social housing associations rather regional centers university school services crous ministers entourage told monde unexpected news enough restore somewhat tarnished olym among students spring education authorities asked olym organizing committee free university units student residences paris region event pushing usual tenants initiative suspended paris administrative court decision dated august grounds permissible crous organize vacancy accommodations advance rooms vacant july rented committee according provisions made law march relating preparations event paris crous lodged appeal council state still pending monde learned crous wish give details arguments put forward ministry part considers judge invalidated principle merit form asserted everything done according rules law minister confirmed maximum students relocated students relocated close possible place study receive lump sum payment two tickets olym also offered students concerned two options possible minister retailleaus entourage would like put end controversy told monde first distribute public servants accredited olympics among vacant places residences summer period choice meant people living staggered schedules according rhythm competitions cohabiting students taking exams working summer ideal said,septemb pari olym leav materi legaci minist higher educ sylvi retailleau announc parisien octob intern competit hous unit host athlet journalist pari olym use student hous eighti percent unit locat depart sein saint deni north pari remaind villeneuv dascq lill metropolitan area northern franc manag accommod entrust privat organ notabl social hous associ rather region center univers school servic crou minist entourag told mond unexpect news enough restor somewhat tarnish olym among student spring educ author ask olym organ committe free univers unit student resid pari region event push usual tenant initi suspend pari administr court decis date august ground permiss crou organ vacanc accommod advanc room vacant juli rent committe accord provis made law march relat prepar event pari crou lodg appeal council state still pend mond learn crou wish give detail argument put forward ministri part consid judg invalid principl merit form assert everyth done accord rule law minist confirm maximum student reloc student reloc close possibl place studi receiv lump sum payment two ticket olym also offer student concern two option possibl minist retailleau entourag would like put end controversi told mond first distribut public servant accredit olymp among vacant place resid summer period choic meant peopl live stagger schedul accord rhythm competit cohabit student take exam work summer ideal said
Baseball: Texas Rangers win first-ever World Series title,    The Texas Rangers secured their first World Series championship in franchise history on Wednesday with a 5-0 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. ,"The Texas Rangers captured the World Series for the first time in the team's 63-year history on Wednesday, November 1, defeating Arizona 5-0 to complete a historic playoff championship run. Marcus Semien's two-run home run, a run-scoring Mitch Garver single and a pivotal ninth-inning Diamondbacks error produced the runs that enabled Texas to win Major League Baseball's best-of-seven final by 4-1. ""It's just emotional,"" Semien said. ""Everything I have ever worked for is for this moment.""Texas went undefeated in 11 contests on the road away from their suburban Dallas home ballpark, capped by sweeping three games in Phoenix over the Diamondbacks. ""It's such a treat,"" the Rangers' Nathaniel Lowe said. ""We really did a great job of finishing here on the road. Maybe we struggled at home but we've got a special group.""The Rangers, who began as the Washington Senators in 1961 before relocating to Texas in 1972, had reached the World Series in 2010 and 2011, losing first to San Francisco and then St. Louis. ""That's one of the coolest feelings of my life,"" Texas slugger Jonah Heim said. ""It's what your work your whole life for. we accomplished our goals. I'm so proud of this team.""The D-backs suffered their first World Series defeat, having won the 2001 crown in their only prior appearance. Arizona pitcher Zac Gallen kept Texas hitless through six innings, the 28-year-old US right-hander baffling the same batters who blasted out 11 runs on 11 hits the night before. ""He had his good stuff working,"" Lowe said. ""But we finally got to him.""The Rangers pounced, however, in the top of the seventh with three consecutive hits as Corey Seager singled to left field, reached third base on Evan Carter's double and scored on Mitch Garver's single up the middle for a 1-0 lead. ""It was kind of a crazy game,"" Semien said. ""We got no-hit until the sixth or whatever inning it was. But we came through. Once Corey got the first hit everybody kind of woke up.""Texas shortstop Seager homered three times and drove in six runs in the World Series to win the Most Valuable Player award, becoming only the fourth player to take it twice after his MVP role for the 2020 champion Los Angeles Dodgers. ""Just happy to be part of this team,"" Seager said. ""We grind it and play through it. It's awesome right now.""After Texas left the bases loaded in the eighth, Josh Jung and Lowe singled to open the ninth for the Rangers and both scored on an error by Arizona's Alek Thomas on Heim's single to make it 3-0. Semien then blasted a two-run homer into the left-field seats for a 5-0 Rangers lead to all but settle matters.When Josh Sborz struck out Ketel Marte for the final out, ending the Arizona batter's 20-game playoff hit streak, the Rangers began a wild celebration. ""We weren't going to let up until the last out was made,"" Heim said. ""We fought hard. We came out on top.""Bruce Bochy, who came out of retirement last year to manage the Rangers, won his fourth World Series title at age 68 after three with San Francisco. ""To get this call, to be a part of this, I know how blessed I am,"" Bochy said. ""I can't thank these guys enough."" The Rangers had missed the playoffs in six consecutive losing seasons before this year's title run.Arizona advanced runners into scoring position in each of the first five innings but came away empty-handed, going 0-for-10 at the plate with those runners on second or third base. The D-backs then stranded runners at first base in the seventh and eighth innings as well.Rangers US right-handed starting pitcher Nathan Eovaldi, who threw six scoreless innings, was the best in the American League this season at denying hits with runners in scoring position and he mystified the D-backs when it mattered early. In the fifth, Arizona loaded the bases on walks to Ketel Marte and Tommy Pham and a Christian Walker two-out single, but Lourdes Gurriel grounded out and another perfect scoring opportunity slipped away.",Sports,texas rangers captured world series first time teams year history wednesday november defeating arizona complete historic playoff championship run marcus semiens two run home run run

World Cup 2034: Football players remain completely silent on human rights violations in Saudi Arabia,"    The monarchy has attracted a range of stars to its league and now looks set to host the 2034 World Cup. At the heart of this powerful sporting soft power movement, players and governing bodies never express views on the kingdom's politics. ","""Morally, it wouldn't make sense."" In February, the American football player Alex Morgan, her compatriot Megan Rapinoe and Dutchwoman Vivianne Miedema publicly protested against the prospect of the 2023 edition of the Women's World Cup (July 20-August 20) being sponsored by the Saudi Arabian Tourist Board.When it negotiated this lucrative contract, FIFA had not anticipated this outcry. Nor did it anticipate the protests of the Australian and New Zealand federations, co-hosts of the tournament, who wrote to FIFA expressing their disapproval of the partnership. Under pressure, FIFA president Gianni Infantino declared a month later that ""discussions with Visit Saudi"" had, in the end, ""not led to an agreement."" It was an announcement that sounded like a victory for the rebels.But Saudi Arabia has many other trump cards to play. In recent years, sports have become a weapon of mass attraction for the Gulf monarchy. The world's leading oil power organizes major boxing and equestrian events, a world golf circuit and an annual Formula 1 race. In 2029, it will host the Asian Games in Neom, a futuristic megalopolis under construction in the middle of the desert.On Tuesday, October 31, FIFA announced that the Saudi kingdom was the only candidate in the running to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup. The future host country of one of the most watched sporting events on the planet is due to be made official at the end of 2024, but the outcome is already almost beyond doubt.To make its local league globally attractive, Saudi Arabia has relied on the four major clubs of the Saudi Pro League. These are 75% owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), one of the world's richest sovereign wealth funds, already a majority shareholder in England's Newcastle United football club.Karim Benzema, Sadio Mané, Neymar, Kalidou Koulibaly and Riyad Mahrez: In the space of a summer, a host of stars have joined the local league, following in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo, who six months earlier had signed for Al-Nassr, one of two teams in the capital city of Riyadh. These investments, numbering in the billions, are part of the ""Vision 2030"" plan, launched in 2016 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as ""MBS,"" and designed to prepare for the post-oil era.MBS is a reformer with two faces: modernizer and despot. On the one hand, he has expanded moral boundaries by granting fundamental rights to women, such as the right to drive, and by allowing public concerts and cinema. On the other hand, he stifles all forms of political protest.",Sports,morally wouldnt make sense february american football player alex morgan compatriot megan rapinoe dutchwoman vivianne miedema publicly protested prospect edition womens world cup july august sponsored saudi arabian tourist board negotiated lucrative contract fifa anticipated outcry anticipate protests australian new zealand federations hosts tournament wrote fifa expressing disapproval partnership pressure fifa president gianni infantino declared month later discussions visit saudi end led agreement announcement sounded like victory rebels saudi arabia many trump cards play recent years sports become weapon mass attraction gulf monarchy worlds leading oil power organizes major boxing equestrian events world golf circuit annual formula race host asian games neom futuristic megalopolis construction middle desert tuesday october fifa announced saudi kingdom candidate running host fifa world cup future host country one watched sporting events planet due made official end outcome already almost beyond doubt make local league globally attractive saudi arabia relied four major clubs saudi pro league owned public investment fund pif one worlds richest sovereign wealth funds already majority shareholder englands newcastle united football club karim benzema sadio man neymar kalidou koulibaly riyad mahrez space summer host stars joined local league following footsteps cristiano ronaldo six months earlier signed nassr one two teams capital city riyadh investments numbering billions part vision plan launched crown prince mohammed bin salman known mbs designed prepare post oil era mbs reformer two faces modernizer despot one hand expanded moral boundaries granting fundamental rights women right drive allowing public concerts cinema hand stifles forms political protest,moral wouldnt make sens februari american footbal player alex morgan compatriot megan rapino dutchwoman viviann miedema publicli protest prospect edit women world cup juli august sponsor saudi arabian tourist board negoti lucr contract fifa anticip outcri anticip protest australian new zealand feder host tournament wrote fifa express disapprov partnership pressur fifa presid gianni infantino declar month later discuss visit saudi end led agreement announc sound like victori rebel saudi arabia mani trump card play recent year sport becom weapon mass attract gulf monarchi world lead oil power organ major box equestrian event world golf circuit annual formula race host asian game neom futurist megalopoli construct middl desert tuesday octob fifa announc saudi kingdom candid run host fifa world cup futur host countri one watch sport event planet due made offici end outcom alreadi almost beyond doubt make local leagu global attract saudi arabia reli four major club saudi pro leagu own public invest fund pif one world richest sovereign wealth fund alreadi major sharehold england newcastl unit footbal club karim benzema sadio man neymar kalid koulibali riyad mahrez space summer host star join local leagu follow footstep cristiano ronaldo six month earlier sign nassr one two team capit citi riyadh invest number billion part vision plan launch crown princ moham bin salman known mb design prepar post oil era mb reform two face modern despot one hand expand moral boundari grant fundament right women right drive allow public concert cinema hand stifl form polit protest
New York City Marathon: The dark side of the race,"This weekend, 50,000 people will take to the starting line of the New York City Marathon on Staten Island. A crowd that poses major environmental challenges – pee breaks among them.","This Sunday, runners in the New York Marathon will start from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which links Staten Island to Brooklyn and, since 1976, marks the beginning of a race that crosses the city's five boroughs. The location provides spectacular aerial views.But apart from the striking effect of seeing 50,000 participants on a suspension bridge, it's understandable that the camera would want to stay high up at marathon starts: The ground is often disgusting. The runners who start last have to watch their feet to avoid tripping over all the things thrown away by the earlier starters: Sweatshirts, garbage bags, energy gel wrappers and even bottles filled with urine rolling around on the pavement. Yes, you read that right.In New York, the problems posed by poor planning of pre-race fluid consumption are more acute than in other major marathons: the outlying starting point means you need to be taken there several hours in advance, either by ferry or by one of the three hundred buses operating for the occasion. Right from this first challenge of the day, it is not uncommon to hear participants begging for access to a toilet as quickly as possible.With the starting groups distributed over the two levels of the suspension bridge, for a long time, rumor had it that those starting from the lower deck were liable to be splashed by runners relieving themselves from the upper deck. Be it to silence the urban legend or to justify a $300 entry fee, the New York Marathon has steadily increased the number of porta-potties set up at the start (over 1,500 this year), while event partner Dunkin' Donuts is responsible for distributing 50,000 coffees and 6,000 teas at the start to runners whose bladders are already running on empty.There will always be participants who refuse to use the porta-potties to avoid losing strategic places in the starting group. Some have previously been seen donning a garbage bag with holes for the arms as a raincoat, and squatting to relieve themselves at the start, surrounded by runners whose feet they have just urinated on. The organizers have had to write a rule clarifying that ""anyone who is seen urinating or defecating in a corral may be disqualified.""As the marathon takes place in November, participants often pack extra clothes to keep warm until the start of the race, which they discard – at best when setting out, at worst within the first few kilometers. Like most major marathons which are criticized for the pollution they cause, the New York marathon has stated for years that discarded items are donated to charity.",Sports,sunday runners new york marathon start verrazano narrows bridge links staten island brooklyn since marks beginning race crosses citys five boroughs location provides spectacular aerial views apart striking effect seeing participants suspension bridge understandable camera would want stay high marathon starts ground often disgusting runners start last watch feet avoid tripping things thrown away earlier starters sweatshirts garbage bags energy gel wrappers even bottles filled urine rolling around pavement yes read right new york problems posed poor planning pre race fluid consumption acute major marathons outlying starting point means need taken several hours advance either ferry one three hundred buses operating occasion right first challenge day uncommon hear participants begging access toilet quickly possible starting groups distributed two levels suspension bridge long time rumor starting lower deck liable splashed runners relieving upper deck silence urban legend justify entry fee new york marathon steadily increased number porta potties set start year event partner dunkin donuts responsible distributing coffees teas start runners whose bladders already running empty always participants refuse use porta potties avoid losing strategic places starting group previously seen donning garbage bag holes arms raincoat squatting relieve start surrounded runners whose feet urinated organizers write rule clarifying anyone seen urinating defecating corral may disqualified marathon takes place november participants often pack extra clothes keep warm start race discard best setting worst within first kilometers like major marathons criticized pollution cause new york marathon stated years discarded items donated charity,sunday runner new york marathon start verrazano narrow bridg link staten island brooklyn sinc mark begin race cross citi five borough locat provid spectacular aerial view apart strike effect see particip suspens bridg understand camera would want stay high marathon start ground often disgust runner start last watch feet avoid trip thing thrown away earlier starter sweatshirt garbag bag energi gel wrapper even bottl fill urin roll around pavement ye read right new york problem pose poor plan pre race fluid consumpt acut major marathon outli start point mean need taken sever hour advanc either ferri one three hundr buse oper occas right first challeng day uncommon hear particip beg access toilet quickli possibl start group distribut two level suspens bridg long time rumor start lower deck liabl splash runner reliev upper deck silenc urban legend justifi entri fee new york marathon steadili increas number porta potti set start year event partner dunkin donut respons distribut coffe tea start runner whose bladder alreadi run empti alway particip refus use porta potti avoid lose strateg place start group previous seen don garbag bag hole arm raincoat squat reliev start surround runner whose feet urin organ write rule clarifi anyon seen urin defec corral may disqualifi marathon take place novemb particip often pack extra cloth keep warm start race discard best set worst within first kilomet like major marathon critic pollut caus new york marathon state year discard item donat chariti
PSG beats Montpellier to go top of Ligue 1,    Reigning champions PSG moved two points clear of Nice of Friday after a defiant 3-0 win at the Parc de Princes. ,"Paris Saint-Germain beat Montpellier 3-0 to climb provisionally top of France's Ligue 1 on Friday, November 3, with Ousmane Dembélé providing much of the ammunition. Luis Enrique's new-look PSG seem to be clicking into gear with Lee Kang-in, Warren Zaïre-Emery and Vitinha bagging the goals in a dominant win. Reigning champions PSG moved two points clear of Nice at the top.""What I see is positive, the objective is to continue to be effective in each match and improve,"" said coach Luis Enrique. ""I undoubtedly saw at the Parc des Princes this evening one of the most beautiful PSG performances (since the start of the season).""Lee's left-foot shot into the top corner on 10 minutes opened the tally and sparked joy after Kylian Mbappé set him up with a clever dummy. ""He is very likeable for any supporter,"" Luis Enrique said of South Korean international Lee. ""He is young, makes an effort in attack and defense, makes very good decisions and is hungry to play.""Mbappé was largely kept quiet by some robust defending ahead of PSG's visit to AC Milan in the Champions League in midweek. Just before the hour mark, Zaïre-Emery made it 2-0 after a back-heel from Dembélé left the 17-year-old in space on the edge of the six-yard box for a nerveless finish.Substitute Vitinha scored with almost his first touch, slamming home from the edge of the area as goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte dived the right way marginally too late. Dembélé himself came close on 26 minutes and Mbappé, who scored his 250th and 251st goals for the club last week, was wasteful from an ensuing corner. Mbappé nodded one in late on but walked away laughing sheepishly because he was so far offside.Having started their European campaign with a 2-0 home win against Borussia Dortmund, PSG lost at Newcastle but top Group F with six points ahead of their trip to Milan in the Champions League after beating the Italians last week.On Saturday all eyes will be on Marseille's match against Lille, a week after the Lyon bus was pelted with heavy objects by OM fans, one of which left Lyon coach Fabio Grosso with a serious facial injury that caused the game to be called off.Nice can climb back on top of the league when they host Rennes on Sunday with third-placed Monaco hosting Brest the same evening.",Sports,paris saint germain beat montpellier climb provisionally top frances ligue friday november ousmane demb providing much ammunition luis enriques new look psg seem clicking gear lee kang warren emery vitinha bagging goals dominant win reigning champions psg moved two points clear nice top see positive objective continue effective match improve said coach luis enrique undoubtedly saw parc des princes evening one beautiful psg performances since start season lees left foot shot top corner minutes opened tally sparked joy kylian mbapp set clever dummy likeable supporter luis enrique said south korean international lee young makes effort attack defense makes good decisions hungry play mbapp largely kept quiet robust defending ahead psgs visit milan champions league midweek hour mark emery made back heel demb left year old space edge six yard box nerveless finish substitute vitinha scored almost first touch slamming home edge area goalkeeper benjamin lecomte dived right way marginally late demb came close minutes mbapp scored goals club last week wasteful ensuing corner mbapp nodded one late walked away laughing sheepishly far offside started european campaign home win borussia dortmund psg lost newcastle top group six points ahead trip milan champions league beating italians last week saturday eyes marseilles match lille week lyon bus pelted heavy objects fans one left lyon coach fabio grosso serious facial injury caused game called nice climb back top league host rennes sunday third placed monaco hosting brest evening,pari saint germain beat montpelli climb provision top franc ligu friday novemb ousman demb provid much ammunit lui enriqu new look psg seem click gear lee kang warren emeri vitinha bag goal domin win reign champion psg move two point clear nice top see posit object continu effect match improv said coach lui enriqu undoubtedli saw parc de princ even one beauti psg perform sinc start season lee left foot shot top corner minut open talli spark joy kylian mbapp set clever dummi likeabl support lui enriqu said south korean intern lee young make effort attack defens make good decis hungri play mbapp larg kept quiet robust defend ahead psg visit milan champion leagu midweek hour mark emeri made back heel demb left year old space edg six yard box nerveless finish substitut vitinha score almost first touch slam home edg area goalkeep benjamin lecomt dive right way margin late demb came close minut mbapp score goal club last week wast ensu corner mbapp nod one late walk away laugh sheepishli far offsid start european campaign home win borussia dortmund psg lost newcastl top group six point ahead trip milan champion leagu beat italian last week saturday eye marseil match lill week lyon bu pelt heavi object fan one left lyon coach fabio grosso seriou facial injuri caus game call nice climb back top leagu host renn sunday third place monaco host brest even
Football: Real Madrid denies reports about Mbappé negotiations,    The club denied Saturday that they are in negotiations to sign Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappé at the end of his contract in June 2024 after recent reports suggested they were in talks. ,"Real Madrid denied Saturday, November 4, that they are in negotiations to sign Paris Saint-Germain striker Kylian Mbappé at the end of his contract in June 2024 after recent reports suggested they were in talks.""In view of the information issued and published recently by different media outlets, in which there is speculation about alleged negotiations between the player Kylian Mbappé and our club, Real Madrid wishes to state that this information is categorically false and that no such negotiations have taken place with a player who belongs to PSG,"" said Madrid in a statement.Spanish newspaper Marca said Thursday that Madrid envisages Mbappé joining the club next year, with the squad believing ""he will land at the Santiago Bernabeu"". Mbappé has been courted by Madrid for several years but turned Los Blancos down by signing a new contract with PSG in May 2022 despite reports he had agreed to join Real Madrid.In the summer, Mbappé was frozen out by PSG until August 13 after refusing to extend his contract.The 24-year-old was not invited to the pre-season tour in Japan and South Korea and missed the French champions' first Ligue 1 match during the dispute.

Djokovic beats Dimitrov for seventh Paris Masters title,"    Novak Djokovic won 6-4, 6-3 to clinch his 40th Masters 1000 title, and stretching his winning run to 18 matches. ","Novak Djokovic defeated Grigor Dimitrov 6-4, 6-3 in Sunday's final to win a record-extending seventh Paris Masters title and close in on securing the year-end number one ranking for an eighth time. The 36-year-old Djokovic eclipsed his previous record set two years ago as the tournament's oldest champion, capturing his 40th Masters 1000 title and stretching his winning run to 18 matches.Djokovic collected his sixth title of the season to draw level with Carlos Alcaraz, adding to the Masters victory in Cincinnati that set him up for a landmark 24th Grand Slam singles crown at the US Open. He will take a 1,490-point lead over Alcaraz into the season-ending ATP Finals in Turin later this month. Djokovic won the tournament for the sixth time last year after Alcaraz withdrew because of injury.""It's incredible. To be able to win it after quite challenging circumstances for me this week,"" said Djokovic, who was hit by a stomach virus that left him feeling under the weather in Paris. He was taken to three sets in each of his three previous rounds but didn't face a single break point against the 17th-ranked Dimitrov.""Basically, coming back from the brink of losing three matches in a row, on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I was very close to losing those matches and somehow managed to find an extra gear when it was needed,"" said Djokovic. ""I think the match was closer than the scoreline indicates, but another amazing win for me. I'm very proud of this one, considering what I've been through this week.""Dimitrov, 32, was chasing his first title in Paris since winning the ATP Finals in 2017 but suffered a 10th straight loss to Djokovic in a meeting of the two oldest players in the top 20.""I think I'm running out of words for Novak,"" said Dimitrov, whose late-season resurgence had seen him beat Daniil Medvedev, Hubert Hurkacz and Stefanos Tsitsipas this week. ""I just want to say how grateful I am for this amazing week. It's been such a rollercoaster for me the past three months.""The pair held serve largely untroubled until Djokovic landed the first blow at 3-3 in the opening set, when Dimitrov gave his rival his first glimpse with a forehand that drifted long. Dimitrov produced a crunching serve that a scrambling Djokovic could only return shallow into the court, but the Bulgarian dumped his backhand into the net to concede the break. Djokovic followed it up with an easy hold and wrapped up the set in the 10th game on his second set point, after Dimitrov scrapped his way back to deuce before spearing a backhand wide.The second set went on serve before Djokovic's greater consistency told once more, Dimitrov coughing up another break point with a wild forehand and then effectively sealing his fate with an errant backhand. Djokovic consolidated his cushion with another routine hold, and while Dimitrov saved a break point at 2-4, it only delayed the inevitable. Dimitrov clawed his way to 30-all on his opponent's serve in the eighth game but his brave resistance soon ended, Djokovic holding and then going on to break again in the ensuing game to seal his 97th career title.",Sports,novak djokovic defeated grigor dimitrov sundays final win record extending seventh paris masters title close securing year end number one ranking eighth time year old djokovic eclipsed previous record set two years ago tournaments oldest champion capturing masters title stretching winning run matches djokovic collected sixth title season draw level carlos alcaraz adding masters victory cincinnati set landmark grand slam singles crown open take point lead alcaraz season ending atp finals turin later month djokovic tournament sixth time last year alcaraz withdrew injury incredible able win quite challenging circumstances week said djokovic hit stomach virus left feeling weather paris taken three sets three previous rounds didnt face single break point ranked dimitrov basically coming back brink losing three matches row thursday friday saturday close losing matches somehow managed find extra gear needed said djokovic think match closer scoreline indicates another amazing win proud one considering ive week dimitrov chasing first title paris since winning atp finals suffered straight loss djokovic meeting two oldest players top think running words novak said dimitrov whose late season resurgence seen beat daniil medvedev hubert hurkacz stefanos tsitsipas week want say grateful amazing week rollercoaster past three months pair held serve largely untroubled djokovic landed first blow opening set dimitrov gave rival first glimpse forehand drifted long dimitrov produced crunching serve scrambling djokovic could return shallow court bulgarian dumped backhand net concede break djokovic followed easy hold wrapped set game second set point dimitrov scrapped way back deuce spearing backhand wide second set went serve djokovics greater consistency told dimitrov coughing another break point wild forehand effectively sealing fate errant backhand djokovic consolidated cushion another routine hold dimitrov saved break point delayed inevitable dimitrov clawed way opponents serve eighth game brave resistance soon ended djokovic holding going break ensuing game seal career title,novak djokov defeat grigor dimitrov sunday final win record extend seventh pari master titl close secur year end number one rank eighth time year old djokov eclips previou record set two year ago tournament oldest champion captur master titl stretch win run match djokov collect sixth titl season draw level carlo alcaraz ad master victori cincinnati set landmark grand slam singl crown open take point lead alcaraz season end atp final turin later month djokov tournament sixth time last year alcaraz withdrew injuri incred abl win quit challeng circumst week said djokov hit stomach viru left feel weather pari taken three set three previou round didnt face singl break point rank dimitrov basic come back brink lose three match row thursday friday saturday close lose match somehow manag find extra gear need said djokov think match closer scorelin indic anoth amaz win proud one consid ive week dimitrov chase first titl pari sinc win atp final suffer straight loss djokov meet two oldest player top think run word novak said dimitrov whose late season resurg seen beat daniil medvedev hubert hurkacz stefano tsitsipa week want say grate amaz week rollercoast past three month pair held serv larg untroubl djokov land first blow open set dimitrov gave rival first glimps forehand drift long dimitrov produc crunch serv scrambl djokov could return shallow court bulgarian dump backhand net conced break djokov follow easi hold wrap set game second set point dimitrov scrap way back deuc spear backhand wide second set went serv djokov greater consist told dimitrov cough anoth break point wild forehand effect seal fate errant backhand djokov consolid cushion anoth routin hold dimitrov save break point delay inevit dimitrov claw way oppon serv eighth game brave resist soon end djokov hold go break ensu game seal career titl
Paris FC's gamble: Free tickets for all until the end of the season,"    The club, whose men's team competes in Ligue 2 and women's team in Division 1, has announced that 15,000 of the 17,000 seats at Stade Charléty will be available free of charge for all league matches until the end of the season. ","Starting on November 11, you won't need to pull out your wallet to attend a professional football match in Paris. At Stade Charléty, Paris FC's league matches will now be free of charge, the club's president club announced on Friday, November 3. The new ticketing policy applies to both the men's team in Ligue 2 and the women's team, which is currently joint-top of Division 1 and has qualified for this season's Women's Champions League.Until the end of the 2023-2024 season, 15,000 of the stadium's 17,000 seats will be available for free, excluding only VIP packages, premium seats, and the away end. ""This is a first in Europe and even in the world for a professional club,"" Paris FC claimed in a press release.The club's president, Pierre Ferraci, said the aim is twofold: ""To recapture the popular essence of football by making it accessible to as many people as possible,"" and ""to increase the level of attendance at Stade Charléty."" The club hopes to attract new fans to the stadium – which had long been derided for being oversized and having a chilly atmosphere.Attendance is a key factor in attracting new investors, but the question will be whether it compensates for the shortfall in ticket sales, which the club has estimated at ""one million euros over the year.""Freebies are not a complete novelty in professional football: There are one-off operations, invitations, and contests to win tickets. But this is the first time the idea is applied so widely and so openly: at Stade Charléty, all matches will be free, apart from Coupe de France and Women's Champions League, due to rules specific to those competitions.Fortuna Düsseldorf, in Germany's second division, had previously experimented with a similar approach, but less ambitiously. The club announced last April that tickets for at least three of its matches would be free of charge, and has planned to make them completely free over the next five years.On October 21, for this new model's premiere, over 52,000 fans packed into the Merkur Spiel Arena, well above the usual attendance of 29,300. The increase is encouraging for Paris FC, which has an average attendance of 4,135 fans, or 24% of capacity.The Parisian club's situation is ideal for such an experiment: it has a venue capable of hosting a much larger number of spectators than it currently does, and the drop in ticketing revenue will not be a hard blow. Ticket sales only account for 4% of the club's budget, compared with an average of 8 to 10% among other clubs in Ligue 2.""We're not taking a big risk, and we won't lose out,"" said Feracci. ""The balance will be positive, thanks to new sponsorship income and the arrival of new shareholders who have shown themselves to be keen on our vision. I'm confident that we'll soon have a third shareholder from the CAC 40 [stock index].""Luc Arrondel, an economist specializing in football, agreed: ""Good attendance means greater visibility for sponsors, and therefore greater attractiveness for the club, which will be able to generate revenue and finance its sporting campaign."" This strategy has also been adopted by the club, which now targets a wider audience by offering events alongside the match itself. ""Better attendance at home also means better sporting results, with a crowd that encourages its players and pushes them to excel,"" added Arrondel.In his study ""Faut-il payer les supporters?"" (""Should fans be paid?""), the economist questions whether supporters should be rewarded for their preponderant role in a team's performance, which in turn affects the club's main source of revenue, TV rights. That notion is still a long way off, but just a few years ago, this model of free tickets for a season also seemed impossible.Could the model become widespread? ""In Ligue 1, ticketing plays a more important role, accounting for around 10 to 15% of [team] budgets,"" said Arrondel. ""At a PSG [Paris Saint-Germain] match, for example, it represents 50% of the evening's revenue. It really depends on the club, so it's difficult to generalize. We've noticed that it's mainly second-division clubs that are venturing into this area."" Feracci confirmed this: ""If we go up to Ligue 1, which is our objective, the question will come up again.""But first, see you on November 11 at the Stade Charléty, for the 14th matchweek of Ligue 2, when Paris FC will host Bastia for the first match of this new era of free tickets.",Sports,starting november wont need pull wallet attend professional football match paris stade charl paris fcs

"Ethiopia's Tola, Kenya's Obiri the winners at New York City Marathon","    Tamirat Tola won the men's race in a time of 2:4:58, a course record. Reigning Boston Marathon champion Hellen Obiri won the women's race in 2:27:23. ","Tamirat Tola of Ethiopia set a course record to win the New York City Marathon men's race on Sunday, November 5, while Hellen Obiri of Kenya pulled away in the final 400 meters to take the women's title.Tola finished in 2 hours, 4 minutes and 58 seconds, topping the 2:05:06 set by Geoffrey Mutai in 2011. Tola pulled away from countrymate Jemel Yimer when the pair were heading towards the Bronx at mile 20. By the time he headed back into Manhattan a mile later, he was up by 19 seconds and chasing Mutai's mark. Kenya's Albert Korir was second with Ethiopia's Shura Kitata third.While the men’s race was well decided before the last few miles, the women’s race came down to the stretch. Obiri, Letesenbet Gidey of Ethiopia and defending champion Sharon Lokedi of Kenya were all running together exchanging the lead. Obiri made a move as the trio headed back into Central Park for the final half-mile and finished in 2:27:23. Gidey finished second, 6 seconds behind. Lokedi was 10 seconds behind Obiri, who won the Boston Marathon in April.This was a stellar women's field that was expected to potentially take down the course record of 2:22:31 set by Margaret Okayo in 2003. Unlike last year when the weather was unseasonably warm with temperatures in the 20 degrees Celsius, Sunday’s race was much cooler with it being in the low 10°s — ideal conditions for record-breaking times.Instead, the women had a tactical race with 11 runners, including Americans Kellyn Taylor and Molly Huddle in the lead pack for the first 20 miles. Taylor and Huddle both led the group at points before falling back and finishing in eighth and ninth.Once the lead group came back into Manhattan for the final few miles, Obiri, Gidey and Lokedi pushed the pace. As the trio entered Central Park they further distanced themselves from Kenya's Brigid Kosgei, who finished fourth.The men's and women's winners finished within a few minutes of each other. About an hour earlier, Marcel Hug won the men’s wheelchair race, finishing a few seconds short of his own course record by finishing in 1:25:29. It was the Swiss star’s record-extending sixth NYC Marathon victory. ""It’s incredible. I think it takes some time to realize what happened,"" Hug said. ""I’m so happy as well."" He’s the most decorated champion in the wheelchair race at the event, breaking a tie with Tatyana McFadden and Kurt Fearnley for most wins in the division in event history.Catherine Debrunner of Switzerland won her New York debut, shattering the course record in the women's wheelchair race. She finished in 1:39:32, besting the previous mark by over 3 minutes, which was held by American Susannah Scaroni. ""It’s difficult to describe in words. I said to my coach if I win this race, it’s the best performance I ever showed,"" she said. ""Knew it’s the toughest marathon of all. It was the first time. I knew it was going to be so tough.""Debrunner and Tola both earned a $50,000 bonus for topping the previous course records.",Sports,tamirat tola ethiopia set course record win new york city marathon mens race sunday november hellen obiri kenya pulled away final meters take womens title tola finished hours minutes seconds topping set geoffrey mutai tola pulled away countrymate jemel yimer pair heading towards bronx mile time headed back manhattan mile later seconds chasing mutais mark kenyas albert korir second ethiopias shura kitata third men race well decided last miles women race came stretch obiri letesenbet gidey ethiopia defending champion sharon lokedi kenya running together exchanging lead obiri made move trio headed back central park final half mile finished gidey finished second seconds behind lokedi seconds behind obiri boston marathon april stellar womens field expected potentially take course record set margaret okayo unlike last year weather unseasonably warm temperatures degrees celsius sunday race much cooler low ideal conditions record breaking times instead women tactical race runners including americans kellyn taylor molly huddle lead pack first miles taylor huddle led group points falling back finishing eighth ninth lead group came back manhattan final miles obiri gidey lokedi pushed pace trio entered central park distanced kenyas brigid kosgei finished fourth mens womens winners finished within minutes hour earlier marcel hug men wheelchair race finishing seconds short course record finishing swiss star record extending sixth nyc marathon victory incredible think takes time realize happened hug said happy well decorated champion wheelchair race event breaking tie tatyana mcfadden kurt fearnley wins division event history catherine debrunner switzerland new york debut shattering course record womens wheelchair race finished besting previous mark minutes held american susannah scaroni difficult describe words said coach win race best performance ever showed said knew toughest marathon first time knew going tough debrunner tola earned bonus topping previous course records,tamirat tola ethiopia set cours record win new york citi marathon men race sunday novemb hellen obiri kenya pull away final meter take women titl tola finish hour minut second top set geoffrey mutai tola pull away countrym jemel yimer pair head toward bronx mile time head back manhattan mile later second chase mutai mark kenya albert korir second ethiopia shura kitata third men race well decid last mile women race came stretch obiri letesenbet gidey ethiopia defend champion sharon lokedi kenya run togeth exchang lead obiri made move trio head back central park final half mile finish gidey finish second second behind lokedi second behind obiri boston marathon april stellar women field expect potenti take cours record set margaret okayo unlik last year weather unseason warm temperatur degre celsiu sunday race much cooler low ideal condit record break time instead women tactic race runner includ american kellyn taylor molli huddl lead pack first mile taylor huddl led group point fall back finish eighth ninth lead group came back manhattan final mile obiri gidey lokedi push pace trio enter central park distanc kenya brigid kosgei finish fourth men women winner finish within minut hour earlier marcel hug men wheelchair race finish second short cours record finish swiss star record extend sixth nyc marathon victori incred think take time realiz happen hug said happi well decor champion wheelchair race event break tie tatyana mcfadden kurt fearnley win divis event histori catherin debrunn switzerland new york debut shatter cours record women wheelchair race finish best previou mark minut held american susannah scaroni difficult describ word said coach win race best perform ever show said knew toughest marathon first time knew go tough debrunn tola earn bonu top previou cours record
Champions League: AC Milan get crucial win over PSG,    Frenchman Olivier Giroud scored the decisive goal for the Italian side as they picked up a pivotal 2-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain at the San Siro to stay alive in Group F. ,"Olivier Giroud fired AC Milan back into Champions League contention with the decisive goal in a 2-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, November 7. France striker Giroud thumped home a trademark header four minutes after the break at a pulsating San Siro to reignite Milan's chances of reaching the last 16 and turn around a dreadful recent run of form.Stefano Pioli's team started the day bottom of Group F but are now well in contention for the knockout stages, third on five points and just one behind PSG who occupy the second qualification spot. Tuesday's win was revenge for a 3-0 hammering in Paris a fortnight ago and came with Milan's first goals in the competition this season, the hugely impressive Rafael Leao drawing the hosts level in the 12th minute after former Inter Milan defender Milan Skriniar had nodded PSG into an early lead.Giroud's winner was his seventh goal of the season in all competitions and there was a French flavor to the finish that downed Ligue 1 champions PSG, Theo Hernandez supplying the pinpoint cross from which his Les Bleus teammate netted. Milan next face group leaders Borussia Dortmund, who took the top spot by one point from PSG with their 2-0 win over Newcastle United earlier on Tuesday, in a match which could well be crucial to their chances of getting out of the group.Their fans also got revenge on public enemy number one Gianluigi Donnarumma who controversially left Milan for PSG as a free agent two years ago and was greeted with a wave of hate from the packed stands. A day that started with the news that a PSG fan had been stabbed in clashes between both sets of supporters late on Monday night reached fever pitch when the teams took to the field and home fans unloaded on Italy goalkeeper Donnarumma. Milan fans printed thousands of fake dollar bills depicting his face with the word ""mercenary"" and the disparaging nickname ""Dollarumma.""They were launched onto the field after the traditional pre-match display amid loud, insulting chants toward Donnarumma, which only got louder as he had to walk toward the goal nearest Milan's hardcore fans just before kick-off. Some fans rolled the bills into hard balls and pelted them onto the pitch, where they pinged off the grass just by where he was standing.Once the match was finally up and running it was Milan who should have taken the lead first when Ruben Loftus-Cheek smashed a great chance over the bar after Leao's blazing run and cut-back. Skriniar had the away side ahead three minutes later after Loftus-Cheek allowed him to drift away and easily nod in Marquinhos' flick-on from a corner.But Leao was clearly up for it after a series of underwhelming recent performances and another of his trademark bursts brought Milan level almost immediately. The Portugal winger charged down the middle, offloaded to Giroud and after his shot was parried by Donnarumma, flicked in the leveler with an acrobatic overhead kick.PSG was dangerous on almost every attack and, after Mike Maignan had to be quick off his line to stop Kylian Mbappe twice, Ousmane Dembele thwacked the crossbar in the 27th minute. Seconds later Giroud smashed into the side netting after Loftus-Cheek's powerful dribble in a breathless opening period which nearly finished with Milan deservedly ahead when Leao drilled just wide of Donnarumma's near post.Giroud had his moment of glory with a classic center-forward header from Theo Hernandez's cross after Leao nearly poked home. PSG were livid at what they thought was a foul on Achraf Hakimi from Leao, who was still on the ground when Giroud thumped home what turned out to be the winner.Donnarumma denied Milan a more convincing victory when he brilliantly tipped wide Noah Okafor's angled drive with five minutes left. And Lee Kang-in almost made Milan pay when he cut inside and slammed the post in a tense finale which ended with a massive roar of relief at the final whistle.",Sports,olivier giroud fired milan back

French Alps launch bid for 2030 Winter Olympics,"    France, which is hosting the Summer Olympics in 2024 and has hosted the Winter Games three times, would spread the competition among sites across the Alps. ","With Paris about to stage the 2024 Summer Olympics, France officially launched a bid on Tuesday, November 7, for the 2030 Winter Games, spread over sites with existing infrastructure from Nice to the Haute-Savoie.Nice would host the Olympic village, media center and indoor skating events, meaning an ice rink would have to be built at the coastal city. The ski resort Méribel-Courchevel would host the alpine skiing events. Isola 2000, just a 90-minute drive from Nice, would host the snowboard competitions. And the Grand-Bornand is earmarked for the Nordic events.The head of the French Olympic Committee David Lappartient and President of the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur region Renaud Muselier promised the bid would be 95% based on existing sites when they outlined their proposals.Switzerland and Sweden have already declared themselves candidates and France is keen to avoid running over a proposed budget of €1.5 billion.""We will trim down this budget,"" Lappartient, also head of the International Cycling Union, said. ""The world is changing and we need to change too, there is no room for white elephants. As with Paris, we are seeking a durable legacy on viable economic terms to reflect the changing world.""A decision on the hosts for the 2030 and 2034 Winter Games will be made most likely in July 2024.France has hosted the Winter Games three times: at Chamonix in 1924, Grenoble in 1968 and Albertville in 1992.""We have a great chance of winning because of our skiing facilities.

Olympics 2024: French Polynesia president suggests replanning surfing venue,"    Following local opposition to the construction of a metal tower for judges at the famous surfing venue of Teahupo'o, President Moetai Brotherson suggested Taharuu Beach as an alternative. ","The president of the French overseas territory of French Polynesia has suggested an alternative venue for the 2024 Olympics surf competition after plans for a gigantic tower at a planned venue in Tahiti site caused uproar.Surfers are due to catch the first waves of the Paris Games in nine months in Tahiti, some 15,000 kilometers from the French capital, but a plan to build a giant tower in a legendary surf spot is sparking resistance. The organizers of the 2024 Games want to erect a 14-meter aluminum structure in the water for judges to better assess the competition.Local associations have led protests against the tower, saying its installation would damage corals beyond repair. Several hundred people recently joined a peaceful protest at the site near the village of Teahupo'o – one of the world's most famous surfing areas and the designated Olympic venue. An online petition against the project has attracted close to 150,000 signatures.Moetai Brotherson, President of French Polynesia – which comprises more than 100 islands including Tahiti – told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday, November 7, that he shared the environmental concerns, and suggested a different spot for the competition, without the need for a tower.While less well-known than the original venue, the site at Taharuu Beach on Tahiti's west coast was more accessible and already had all the necessary infrastructure on land, he said on the sidelines of a Pacific islands forum on the Cook Islands. Taharuu had been in the running previously but, Brotherson said, ""that choice wasn't possible at the time."" However, he said, ""given the stakes and the protests today, perhaps we could revisit that option."" He said drilling for the tower's foundations would not be possible without ""breaking corals.""Brotherson, who supports independence from France, took up his post in the wake of elections this year won by pro-independence forces who want to negotiate a referendum with Paris on the archipelago's status. French Polynesia is one of several French overseas territories that span the Caribbean and the Pacific and give Paris a global footprint unmatched by any other European nation.Surfing made its bow as an Olympic sport at the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games, when it was held on Tsurigasaki Beach on mainland Japan, and France was keen to keep it on the roster. France's Atlantic coast hosts some of Europe's most famous surfing beaches and local officials had been hopeful of hosting the event.When Tahiti was announced, dignitaries in coastal resorts like Biarritz were unimpressed – not least because of the cost and the carbon emissions involved in putting a chunk of the Olympics on in the South Pacific. The tower alone is expected to cost around 4.4 million euros ($4.7 million).",Sports,president french overseas territory french polynesia suggested alternative venue olympics surf competition plans gigantic tower planned venue tahiti site caused uproar surfers due catch first waves paris games nine months tahiti kilometers french capital plan build giant tower legendary surf spot sparking resistance organizers games want erect meter aluminum structure water judges better assess competition local associations led protests tower saying installation would damage corals beyond repair several hundred people recently joined peaceful protest site near village teahupoo one worlds famous surfing areas designated olym online petition project attracted close signatures moetai brotherson president french polynesia comprises islands including tahiti told agence france presse tuesday november shared environmental concerns suggested different spot competition without need tower less well known original venue site taharuu beach tahitis west coast accessible already necessary infrastructure land said sidelines pacific islands forum cook islands taharuu running previously brotherson said choice wasnt possible time however said given stakes protests today perhaps could revisit option said drilling towers foundations would possible without breaking corals brotherson supports independence france took post wake elections year pro independence forces want negotiate referendum paris archipelagos status french polynesia one several french overseas territories span caribbean pacific give paris global footprint unmatched european nation surfing made bow olym covid delayed tokyo games held tsurigasaki beach mainland japan france keen keep roster frances atlantic coast hosts europes famous surfing beaches local officials hopeful hosting event tahiti announced dignitaries coastal resorts like biarritz unimpressed least cost carbon emissions involved putting chunk olympics south pacific tower alone expected cost around million euros million,presid french oversea territori french polynesia suggest altern venu olymp surf competit plan gigant tower plan venu tahiti site caus uproar surfer due catch first wave pari game nine month tahiti kilomet french capit plan build giant tower legendari surf spot spark resist organ game want erect meter aluminum structur water judg better assess competit local associ led protest tower say instal would damag coral beyond repair sever hundr peopl recent join peac protest site near villag teahupoo one world famou surf area design olym onlin petit project attract close signatur moetai brotherson presid french polynesia compris island includ tahiti told agenc franc press tuesday novemb share environment concern suggest differ spot competit without need tower less well known origin venu site taharuu beach tahiti west coast access alreadi necessari infrastructur land said sidelin pacif island forum cook island taharuu run previous brotherson said choic wasnt possibl time howev said given stake protest today perhap could revisit option said drill tower foundat would possibl without break coral brotherson support independ franc took post wake elect year pro independ forc want negoti referendum pari archipelago statu french polynesia one sever french oversea territori span caribbean pacif give pari global footprint unmatch european nation surf made bow olym covid delay tokyo game held tsurigasaki beach mainland japan franc keen keep roster franc atlant coast host europ famou surf beach local offici hope host event tahiti announc dignitari coastal resort like biarritz unimpress least cost carbon emiss involv put chunk olymp south pacif tower alon expect cost around million euro million
Galthié opens up on 'scar' of failing to win Rugby World Cup,"    Hosts France were one of the favorites to win the tournament but lost a thrilling quarter-final 29-28 to the eventual champions. 'For us, it was a time of mourning,' said French coach Fabien Galthié, who had not spoken to the press since the night of the loss on October 15. ","Over three weeks since their quarter-final exit at the hands of South Africa, France coach Fabien Galthié finally opened up on Wednesday, November 8, about the ""scar that will stay with us for life.""Hosts France were one of the favorites to win the tournament but lost a thrilling quarter-final 29-28 to the eventual champions. ""For us, it was a time of mourning,"" said Galthié, who had not spoken to the press since the night of the loss on October 15. ""It's a huge disappointment after four years of hard work, four years of successful work with 80% wins and all those records. ""The only objective we wanted to achieve was to be world champions. There was no other. It would have been the same disappointment if we'd lost in the semi-final by one point,"" he said. The difference is that we would have had an extra week. The difference is enormous because we wanted to experience these moments that we've been working toward for four years.""Galthié, 54, took over as coach in December 2019 and reinvigorated an under-achieving team. Last month, following France's exit, he signed a new contract until June 2028, along with team manager Raphael Ibanez, defense coach Shaun Edwards and scrum specialist William Servat, allowing him to set his sights on the 2027 World Cup in Australia.French rugby fans can expect more of the high-octane flare that has epitomized his team since taking over.

2030 Winter Olympics: France vows to host 'the first sustainable Olympics',"    The bid submitted by the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur regions, which will use 95% existing infrastructure, was officially submitted to the International Olympic Committee on Tuesday. ","The news is now official. France is a candidate to host the 2030 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. On Tuesday, November 7, the French National Olympic and Sports Committee (CNOSF) submitted the bid submitted by the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (southeast-central) and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (southeastern) regions to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). CNOSF President David Lappartient unveiled the main principles at the Maison du sport français in Paris along with the presidents of the two regional governments, Laurent Wauquiez and Renaud Muselier, and the head of the Paralympic Committee (CPSF), Marie-Amélie Le Fur.""The French Alps are the most beautiful natural setting for reviving the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. The memories of Albertville [1992] are still very strong,"" said Wauquiez enthusiastically. ""We were the last out of the starting gate [compared with rival bids from Switzerland and Sweden], but we hope to be the first to arrive,"" added Lappartient optimistically, who stated during the summer that France ""has a real chance. The timing is right and our infrastructures are very attractive.""Yet the timing is surprising. Hastily put together over the summer, France's bid for the 2030 Winter Olympics comes at a time before the Paris 2024 Games have even begun. With two events so closely scheduled in time, it is reasonable to question France's chances of winning. But Salt Lake City, which was initially a candidate for the 2030 Games, is due to organize the 2034 Games, just six years after the Los Angeles 2028 Summer Games, as part of the double awarding of the Games approved by the IOC. The proximity between consecutive events no longer seems to be an obstacle for the Lausanne-based body when it comes to awarding events.France, which hosted the Winter Games in 1924 in Chamonix, in 1968 in Grenoble and in 1992 Albertville, is promising to organize ""simple and responsible"" Games – ""the first sustainable Olympics"" – in winter 2030, thanks to its use of 95% existing infrastructure, as Wauquiez pointed out. The head of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region wants to ""make the French Alps the first sustainable mountains in the world,"" and the Games will be a ""catalyst"" to help them achieve this.The 2030 project, with an estimated budget of €1.5 billion – ""no higher than Milan-Cortina in 2026,"" promised Lappartient – calls for the construction of just one facility, an ice rink in Nice, where the ice events (field hockey, curling, figure skating) will be held. The various venues for the Games are divided into four geographical hubs, namely Haute-Savoie (eastern), Savoie (southeastern), Briançonnais (southeastern) and Nice Côte d'Azur (southern).",Sports,news official france candidate host olym paralym games tuesday november french national olym sports committee cnosf submitted bid submitted auvergne alpes southeast central provence alpes dazur southeastern regions international olym ioc cnosf president david lappartient unveiled main principles maison sport fran ais paris along presidents two regional governments laurent wauquiez renaud muselier head paralym cpsf marie lie fur french alps beautiful natural setting reviving olym paralym games memories albertville still strong said wauquiez enthusiastically last starting gate compared rival bids switzerland sweden hope first arrive added lappartient optimistically stated summer france real chance timing right infrastructures attractive yet timing surprising hastily put together summer frances bid winter olympics comes time paris games even begun two events closely scheduled time reasonable question frances chances winning salt lake city initially candidate games due organize games six years los angeles summer games part double awarding games approved ioc proximity consecutive events longer seems obstacle lausanne based body comes awarding events france hosted winter games chamonix grenoble albertville promising organize simple responsible games first sustainable olym winter thanks use existing infrastructure wauquiez pointed head auvergne alpes region wants make french alps first sustainable mountains world games catalyst help achieve project estimated budget billion higher milan cortina promised lappartient calls construction one facility ice rink nice ice events field hockey curling figure skating held various venues games divided four geographical hubs namely haute savoie eastern savoie southeastern brian onnais southeastern nice dazur southern,news offici franc candid host olym paralym game tuesday novemb french nation olym sport committe cnosf submit bid submit auvergn alp southeast central provenc alp dazur southeastern region intern olym ioc cnosf presid david lapparti unveil main principl maison sport fran ai pari along presid two region govern laurent wauquiez renaud museli head paralym cpsf mari lie fur french alp beauti natur set reviv olym paralym game memori albertvil still strong said wauquiez enthusiast last start gate compar rival bid switzerland sweden hope first arriv ad lapparti optimist state summer franc real chanc time right infrastructur attract yet time surpris hastili put togeth summer franc bid winter olymp come time pari game even begun two event close schedul time reason question franc chanc win salt lake citi initi candid game due organ game six year lo angel summer game part doubl award game approv ioc proxim consecut event longer seem obstacl lausann base bodi come award event franc host winter game chamonix grenobl albertvil promis organ simpl respons game first sustain olym winter thank use exist infrastructur wauquiez point head auvergn alp region want make french alp first sustain mountain world game catalyst help achiev project estim budget billion higher milan cortina promis lapparti call construct one facil ice rink nice ice event field hockey curl figur skate held variou venu game divid four geograph hub name haut savoi eastern savoi southeastern brian onnai southeastern nice dazur southern
Football: 17-year-old wonderkid Zaïre-Emery called up to France national team,"    Paris Saint-Germain's academy product Warren Zaïre-Emery was called up for France'es matches in November after impressing on the big stage, in Ligue 1 and the Champions League. ","Paris Saint-Germain's highly-rated teenager Warren Zaïre-Emery was called up by France coach Didier Deschamps for the first time on Thursday, November 9.Aged 17, the PSG academy product has been in impressive form since the start of the season despite intense competition in midfield at his club. He has scored two goals and delivered two assists in 10 league matches, and caught the eye last month on Europe's biggest stage with two assists as PSG beat AC Milan 3-0 in the Champions League.""He's here with us because he's got what it takes to perform at the very highest level, even if there is competition at his position,"" Deschamps said. ""What he is capable of achieving with his club at such a young age shows an enormous potential and maturity.""Zaïre-Emery has been called up for upcoming European qualifiers against Gibraltar and Greece. France is already qualified for next year's tournament in Germany and will look to secure top spot in Group B. France hosts Gibraltar on November 18 in the city of Nice and then takes on Greece in Athens three days later.Before his first call-up for the senior team, Zaïre-Emery had captained the under-21 team managed by former France and Arsenal great Thierry Henry.The teenager joined PSG's youth academy in 2014 and won the Euros with the France under-17 team. Former PSG coach Christophe Galtier gave Zaïre-Emery his French league debut last season when he became the youngest player in the club's history.He was included in Deschamps' 23-man squad in the absence of injured Real Madrid midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, but the France coach said he could have been on the list anyway.Goalkeepers: Alphonse Areola (West Ham), Mike Maignan (AC Milan), Brice Samba (Lens)Defenders: Jonathan Clauss (Marseille), Lucas Hernandez (PSG), Theo Hernandez (AC Milan), Ibrahima Konaté (Liverpool), Jules Koundé (Barcelona), William Saliba (Arsenal), Jean-Clair Todibo (Nice), Dayot Upamecano (Bayern Munich)Midfielders: Eduardo Camavinga (Real Madrid), Youssouf Fofana (Monaco), Boubacar Kamara (Aston Villa), Adrien Rabiot (Juventus), Warren Zaïre-Emery (PSG)Forwards: Kingsley Coman (Bayern Munich), Ousmane Dembélé (PSG), Olivier Giroud (AC Milan), Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid), Randal Kolo Muani (PSG), Kylian Mbappé (PSG), Marcus Thuram (Inter Milan)",Sports,paris saint germains highly rated teenager warren emery called france coach didier deschamps first time thursday november aged psg academy product impressive form since start season despite intense competition midfield club scored two goals delivered two assists league matches caught eye last month europes biggest stage two assists psg beat milan champions league hes hes got takes perform highest level even competition position deschamps said capable achieving club young age shows enormous potential maturity emery called upcoming european qualifiers gibraltar greece france already qualified next years tournament germany look secure top spot group france hosts gibraltar november city nice takes greece athens three days later first call senior team emery captained team managed former france arsenal great thierry henry teenager joined psgs youth academy euros france team former psg coach christophe galtier gave emery french league debut last season became youngest player clubs history included deschamps man squad absence injured real madrid midfielder aur lien tchouam france coach said could list anyway goalkeepers alphonse areola west ham mike maignan milan brice samba lens defenders jonathan clauss marseille lucas hernandez psg theo hernandez milan ibrahima konat liverpool jules kound barcelona william saliba arsenal jean clair todibo nice dayot upamecano bayern munich midfielders eduardo camavinga real madrid youssouf fofana monaco boubacar kamara aston villa adrien rabiot juventus warren emery psg forwards kingsley coman bayern munich ousmane demb psg olivier giroud milan antoine griezmann atletico madrid randal kolo muani psg kylian mbapp psg marcus thuram inter milan,pari saint germain highli rate teenag warren emeri call franc coach didier deschamp first time thursday novemb age psg academi product impress form sinc start season despit intens competit midfield club score two goal deliv two assist leagu match caught eye last month europ biggest stage two assist psg beat milan champion leagu he he got take perform highest level even competit posit deschamp said capabl achiev club young age show enorm potenti matur emeri call upcom european qualifi gibraltar greec franc alreadi qualifi next year tournament germani look secur top spot group franc host gibraltar novemb citi nice take greec athen three day later first call senior team emeri captain team manag former franc arsen great thierri henri teenag join psg youth academi euro franc team former psg coach christoph galtier gave emeri french leagu debut last season becam youngest player club histori includ deschamp man squad absenc injur real madrid midfield aur lien tchouam franc coach said could list anyway goalkeep alphons areola west ham mike maignan milan brice samba len defend jonathan clauss marseil luca hernandez psg theo hernandez milan ibrahima konat liverpool jule kound barcelona william saliba arsen jean clair todibo nice dayot upamecano bayern munich midfield eduardo camavinga real madrid youssouf fofana monaco boubacar kamara aston villa adrien rabiot juventu warren emeri psg forward kingsley coman bayern munich ousman demb psg olivi giroud milan antoin griezmann atletico madrid randal kolo muani psg kylian mbapp psg marcu thuram inter milan
Paris tests dismantling of iconic bookstalls ahead of 2024 Olympics ceremony,"    On Friday, four secondhand bookstalls on the banks of the Seine will be dismantled and reassembled to test whether they can be moved in July 2024, before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games on the Seine. ","On Friday, November 10, Paris City Hall is planning to carry out ""a feasibility test to dismantle, empty, reassemble and reinstall a set of four bouquiniste [bookseller] stands and their contents."" The operation is part of the Paris Police Prefecture's strategy to secure the banks of the Seine during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games on July 26, 2024.Starting at 8:15 pm – weather permitting – this test, similar to putting an old Ikea wardrobe back together, will take place between the Tournelle and Sully bridges. According to the Cultural Association of Paris Bouquinistes, the goal is to help the city hall to decide ""whether or not to remove the bouquiniste stands located on the river route"" of the opening ceremony in July.In a working document dated October 23, Paris City Hall envisaged that 500 to 700 bookstalls would be removed between July 13 and 18, depending on the security perimeter selected, and then reinstalled from August 3. The service provider will be chosen based on its ability to ""work with fragile objects (books, but also small antiques, posters, engravings, etc.) and on stands that are sometimes badly damaged,"" whose weight, including contents, is estimated at 250 kilograms each. The city has already identified ""around 100 stands in poor condition"" which ""will have to be repaired.""It's an understatement to say that the bouquinistes are vehemently opposed to such a removal. They have brandished a petition of support, ""Saving the Seine bouquinistes,"" which has gathered over 173,000 signatures as of November 8. The 200 booksellers are awaiting the results of the test, but are ready to launch an interim proceeding before the Paris administrative court in December.For Friday, the city has commissioned a custom-built base for each of the four bookstalls. But there's no guarantee that this will be the case for all of them. ""The idea for this test did not come from us,"" explained Jérôme Callais, president of the Cultural Association of Paris Bouquinistes. ""Our only hope is to demonstrate that the operation isn't feasible."" He fears that some of the dark green bookstalls, which are as much a part of Paris's heritage as Guimard metro entrances or Wallace fountains, will not survive this treatment − and that City Hall will replace them with something ugly.According to him, ""while the Police Prefecture is doing its job, Paris City Hall is getting out a bazooka to kill a mosquito. When Charles III or the Pope pass along the banks (of the Seine) or when the Tour de France arrives, we're not asked to do anything. For the opening ceremony of the Olympics, all we need to do is close the stands the day of and put a security barrier in front of them.""",Sports,friday november paris city hall planning carry feasibility test dismantle empty reassemble reinstall set four bouquiniste bookseller stands contents operation part paris police prefectures strategy secure banks seine opening ceremony olym july starting weather permitting test similar putting old ikea wardrobe back together take place tournelle sully bridges according cultural association paris bouquinistes goal help city hall decide whether remove bouquiniste stands located river route opening ceremony july working document dated october paris city hall envisaged bookstalls would removed july depending security perimeter selected reinstalled august service provider chosen based ability work fragile objects books also small antiques posters engravings etc stands sometimes badly damaged whose weight including contents estimated kilograms city already identified around stands poor condition repaired understatement say bouquinistes vehemently opposed removal brandished petition support saving seine bouquinistes gathered signatures november booksellers awaiting results test ready launch interim proceeding paris administrative court december friday city commissioned custom built base four bookstalls theres guarantee case idea test come explained callais president cultural association paris bouquinistes hope demonstrate operation isnt feasible fears dark green bookstalls much part pariss heritage guimard metro entrances wallace fountains survive treatment city hall replace something ugly according police prefecture job paris city hall getting bazooka kill mosquito charles iii pope pass along banks seine tour france arrives asked anything opening ceremony olym need close stands day put security barrier front,friday novemb pari citi hall plan carri feasibl test dismantl empti reassembl reinstal set four bouquinist booksel stand content oper part pari polic prefectur strategi secur bank sein open ceremoni olym juli start weather permit test similar put old ikea wardrob back togeth take place tournel sulli bridg accord cultur associ pari bouquinist goal help citi hall decid whether remov bouquinist stand locat river rout open ceremoni juli work document date octob pari citi hall envisag bookstal would remov juli depend secur perimet select reinstal august servic provid chosen base abil work fragil object book also small antiqu poster engrav etc stand sometim badli damag whose weight includ content estim kilogram citi alreadi identifi around stand poor condit repair understat say bouquinist vehement oppos remov brandish petit support save sein bouquinist gather signatur novemb booksel await result test readi launch interim proceed pari administr court decemb friday citi commiss custom built base four bookstal there guarante case idea test come explain callai presid cultur associ pari bouquinist hope demonstr oper isnt feasibl fear dark green bookstal much part pariss heritag guimard metro entranc wallac fountain surviv treatment citi hall replac someth ugli accord polic prefectur job pari citi hall get bazooka kill mosquito charl iii pope pass along bank sein tour franc arriv ask anyth open ceremoni olym need close stand day put secur barrier front
Mourad Merzouki sets the Musée d'Orsay dancing,"    As part of the Cultural Olympiad, the choreographer takes to the exhibition spaces on November 11 and 12, with extracts from shows and walkabouts. ","The Musée d'Orsay is tuning in to the Cultural Olympiad and the Olympic Games. With just nine months to go, the Parisian institution is entering the fray of ""art and sport"" events, which are poised to become the theme of the season for many venues and events. ""We will be at the heart of the plan with the construction of a stadium on Place de la Concorde which will host basketball, skateboarding and breaking,"" said Antonine Fulla, director of cultural programming and auditoriums at the Musée d'Orsay. The opening ceremony on the Seine will pass right in front of our premises. It seemed only natural to participate in our own way.""With breaking, an acrobatic hip-hop style appearing for the first time at the Olympic Games, the entire urban dance scene is enjoying a media boost. Until June 22, a series of shows and walkabouts will punctuate the exhibitions. On Saturday, November 11, and Sunday, November 12, star choreographer Mourad Merzouki, whose Kalypso festival runs until December 23 in 23 towns and cities across the Paris region, takes over various spaces. ""It's the first time – for Mourad– that we are holding a so-called 'open museum', offering him every possible venue for him to cross through,"" said Fulla. ""Between 2 and 6 pm, the 13,000 visitors expected on average each day will be able to enjoy choreographic pastilles, according to their mood, scattered throughout the museum.""From the imposing and majestic grand nave, where a cable and elastic bands have been installed for aerial sequences from the show Vertikal, to the Salle des fêtes, gleaming in its crystal chandeliers (which can be entered exceptionally to see the baroque Folia), to the Fumoir with its square of tables conducive to free improvisations, 10 venues will serve as the setting for some 10 excerpts from five shows by Merzouki. ""These are, as it were, singular scenographies that you have to live up to, and for which dance can provide a new reading,"" he commented.In front of Gustave Courbet's monumental and always breathtaking painting Le Rut du printemps. Combat de cerfs, Merzouki embeds a compact block from Boxe Boxe, created in 2010, as well as on the immense model of the Paris Opéra neighborhood, installed at the rear of the nave. The transparent glass floor is transformed into an astonishing, vertiginous natural base for a surge of bodies between stage and ring.

"At the Pole Summit, Emmanuel Macron hones his climate diplomacy ahead of COP28","    After tough negotiations, 32 countries signed the 'Paris Call for Glaciers and Poles' on Friday, expressing alarm at the situation of polar ice caps and explaining that 200,000 glaciers are threatened with 'almost irreversible retreat.' ","Talking about the fate of the poles and the cryosphere at a time when the world is torn apart by conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East wasn't easy. This week, despite the geopolitical crises, Emmanuel Macron held his Peace Forum, a cycle of meetings covering a wide range of themes, including the situation of the civilian population in Gaza, digital technology and artificial intelligence, and the situation of glaciers and ice floes, sentinels of climate change.On Friday, the French president concluded the One Planet Polar Summit with a speech at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (Museum of Natural History) in Paris. ""We are in a multi-crisis world where everything is connected and interrelated,"" Macron told scientists and government leaders gathered in the Grande Galerie de l’Evolution. ""The subjects of biodiversity and climate (...) are the subjects of tomorrow's crises, and they are inseparable from the hottest security issues we face today. We will avoid tomorrow's misfortunes by doing this. Our duty is not to deviate from this agenda.""Gathered since Wednesday, the scientific community from some 40 countries drew up an assessment of a world in danger. Climate change is three times faster in Arctic regions, and at least half the world's glaciers are set to disappear even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.Noting that 1 billion people are threatened by rising sea levels, Macron spoke of an ""unprecedented"" and ""civilizational"" challenge for humanity. And he pledged to mobilize €1 billion to support polar research. His ambition is to build a polar ship bearing the name of Michel Rocard, the former French prime minister and a key player in Antarctic environmental protection.The money will also be used to finance two projects, explorer Jean-Louis Etienne's Polar Pod to study the Southern Ocean and the Tara Foundation's Arctic Station. Starting in 2026, France will rebuild its Dumont d'Urville station and work to renovate the French-Italian Concordia station, both in Antarctica.But the summit was also an important diplomatic rendezvous three weeks before the start of the 28th Conference of the Parties on Climate Change (COP28), to be held in Dubai from November 30 to December 12. After bitter negotiations on certain terms, 32 countries signed the ""Paris Call for Glaciers and Poles,"" which expresses alarm at the situation of polar ice caps and explains that 200,000 glaciers are threatened with ""almost irreversible retreat.""",Sports,talking fate poles cryosphere time world torn apart conflicts ukraine middle east wasnt easy week despite geopolitical crises emmanuel macron held peace forum cycle meetings covering wide range themes including situation civilian population gaza digital technology artificial intelligence situation glaciers ice floes sentinels climate change friday french president concluded one planet polar summit speech mus national dhistoire naturelle museum natural history paris multi crisis world everything connected interrelated macron told scientists government leaders gathered grande galerie evolution subjects biodiversity climate subjects tomorrows crises inseparable hottest security issues face today avoid tomorrows misfortunes duty deviate agenda gathered since wednesday scientific community countries drew assessment world danger climate change three times faster arctic regions least half worlds glaciers set disappear even global warming limited pre industrial levels noting billion people threatened rising sea levels macron spoke unprecedented civilizational challenge humanity pledged mobilize billion support polar research ambition build polar ship bearing name michel rocard former french prime minister key player antarctic environmental protection money also used finance two projects explorer jean louis etiennes polar pod study southern ocean tara foundations arctic station starting france rebuild dumont durville station work renovate french italian concordia station antarctica summit also important diplomatic rendezvous three weeks start conference parties climate change cop held dubai november december bitter negotiations certain terms countries signed paris call glaciers poles expresses alarm situation polar ice caps explains glaciers threatened almost irreversible retreat,talk fate pole cryospher time world torn apart conflict ukrain middl east wasnt easi week despit geopolit crise emmanuel macron held peac forum cycl meet cover wide rang theme includ situat civilian popul gaza digit technolog artifici intellig situat glacier ice floe sentinel climat chang friday french presid conclud one planet polar summit speech mu nation dhistoir naturel museum natur histori pari multi crisi world everyth connect interrel macron told scientist govern leader gather grand galeri evolut subject biodivers climat subject tomorrow crise insepar hottest secur issu face today avoid tomorrow misfortun duti deviat agenda gather sinc wednesday scientif commun countri drew assess world danger climat chang three time faster arctic region least half world glacier set disappear even global warm limit pre industri level note billion peopl threaten rise sea level macron spoke unpreced civiliz challeng human pledg mobil billion support polar research ambit build polar ship bear name michel rocard former french prime minist key player antarct environment protect money also use financ two project explor jean loui etienn polar pod studi southern ocean tara foundat arctic station start franc rebuild dumont durvil station work renov french italian concordia station antarctica summit also import diplomat rendezv three week start confer parti climat chang cop held dubai novemb decemb bitter negoti certain term countri sign pari call glacier pole express alarm situat polar ice cap explain glacier threaten almost irrevers retreat
French MPs failed to declare trips paid by Qatar,"    The president of the France-Qatar friendship group failed to declare two trips to the emirate for the Football World Cup, in December 2022, and delayed doing so for a trip to the Qatar Formula 1 Grand Prix in October. Three other MPs are under similar scrutiny. ","An accomplished boxer, Christophe Naegelen is ""passionate about sport and competition."" The 39-year-old has been an MP for the LIOT group of miscellaneous independents since 2017, and the president of the France-Qatar friendship group at the Assemblée Nationale since 2022. He was invited as part of a ministerial and Elysée delegation to attend the quarter-finals and final of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in December 2022. Le Monde has learned he was also invited to Qatar at the beginning of October, and attended first practice sessions and then the race at the emirate's Formula 1 Grand Prix, on the Losail circuit.Before he was contacted by Le Monde on Wednesday, November 8, Naegelen had not yet officially declared these benefits and travels to the Assemblée Nationale's public register of invitations and trips accepted by MPs. He has confirmed that he has done so, after he spoked with Le Monde. The MP's three declarations were published on Thursday, November 9, with him acknowledging that he made two of them ""belatedly.""On May 30, Naegelen had duly declared in the public register another four-day trip to Doha in June, as part of the France-Qatar friendship group, paid for by the Qatari embassy in France.When contacted by Le Monde, the Assemblée Nationale replied, according to its regulations, elected members must declare, ""within one month of its reception, any donation, invitation to a sporting or cultural event or advantage"" as well as ""any acceptance of an invitation to travel, regardless of the third party, from which they have benefited as a result of their mandate. The declaration, made prior to the trip, must be accompanied by details of the travel plans and details of the travel arrangements.""""These general rules apply to the activities of MPs within the context of friendship groups. The value threshold has been set at 150 euros,"" said the Assemblée Nationale, adding that its ethics officer Jean-Eric Gicquel can monitor certain elected officials more closely in the event of a tip-off, and report breaches to the bureau of the Assemblée, the body that can take disciplinary action.Naegelen received a free seat at the stadium and free accommodation (for two nights) for the 2022 World Cup quarter-finals. Initially invited by the emirate, the MP was part of a delegation led by Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castera (whose accommodation was paid for by Qatar), which notably met with the International Labor Organization and the tournament's organizing committee.

Paris 2024: Tahiti residents question Olympics' impact on surfing spot,"    The choice of Teahupo'o as the venue for the surfing event delighted fans. But many Tahitians are opposed to the construction of new infrastructure on this site for the Games, because of the irreparable damage to the coral reef ecosystem. ","The source of all the discord is the future aluminum tower intended for the Olympic Games judges and a few cameras. Because of the foundations that are to be drilled into the coral, it is the focus of all the opposition in Tahiti, where the surfing events of the Paris 2024 Olympics are due to take place. Environmentalists, surfers, local fishermen; all were hoping to keep the sturdy wooden tower that has officiated for two decades for the annual events of the World Surf League (WSL), the world surfing circuit, at Teahupo'o. ""Even during the 'code red' in 2011, with a series of 15-meter waves, the tower held,"" recalled Tahitian surfer Matahi Drollet, whose video against the aluminum tower, posted at the end of October on Instagram, spread the protests internationally.Until last month, opponents were keeping a low profile. The inhabitants of the small village of Teahupo'o, on the south coast of the Taiarapu peninsula, did express their concern when Paris 2024 selected their emblematic wave – one of the most beautiful on the planet. They live at PK0, point kilometer zero. Beyond that point, there is no road. Their village is the end of the world. Authentic Polynesia, far from the traffic jams of Papeete. A rural life, between fa'a'apu (agriculture) and fishing, at sea and in the lagoon. They were promptly reassured by the Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games (OCOG) that the work would respect their environment and that nothing would alter the character of their village.Teahupo'o's isolation was, however, a blow to the Games' environmental commitments: The athletes will be accommodated on a cruise ship anchored in Vairao Bay, just a stone's throw from the emblematic wave. In the absence of a nearby hotel, this was the only solution for accommodation within 45 minutes of the competition site, as required by the Olympic specifications.And then there was the tower. The old one wasn't up to Olympic standards; the new one had to have an air-conditioned server room, toilets, pipes in the lagoon for their evacuation, and fiber optics. But this tower is taller and twice as heavy as the previous one, so it needs more solid foundations, ones dug into the coral. Surfers fear irreparable destruction of the underwater topography that shapes their waves. If the coral is attacked, fishermen fear ciguatera, a disease transmitted by lagoon fish.

Judge recommends eight-month suspended term for French rugby player Chalureau over racist attack,"    Bastien Chalureau, a second-row lock who was part of France's Rugby World Cup squad earlier this year, was appealing a sentence for 'acts of violence that were 'committed because of the race or ethnicity of the victim.' ","A French judge recommended on Tuesday, March 14, that France lock Bastien Chalureau be handed an eight-month suspended prison sentence for a racially motivated attack in 2020.Second-row Chalureau, 31, who was part of France's Rugby World Cup squad earlier this year, was originally given a six-month suspended sentence but appealed. During his recommendations at the Toulouse Court of Appeal, the judge suggested a heavier sentence, two months longer than Chalureau's original one.""The facts have been established,"" the judge said before adding that the complainants ""spoke of undeniably racist remarks?"" The court's decision regarding the judge's recommendation is expected on January 16, 2024.""I greatly regret what I did, I am not racist,"" Chalureau, who admitted he had consumed a lot of beer, whiskey and vodka the evening of the attack, told the court. ""I have never made an inappropriate comment toward anyone. I have worked on myself with a psychologist, I've changed my lifestyle.""The court case overshadowed the start of France's World Cup campaign, before they were knocked out by eventual winners South Africa in the quarter-finals last month. Chalureau played just half an hour during the campaign after being called up to replace the injured Paul Willemse.Montpellier's Chalureau had accepted he attacked two other rugby players during a night out in January 2020 but denies using racist language during the incident. It took place in Toulouse, when Chalureau played for the town's top-flight club.In November 2020, a Toulouse court sentenced Chalureau to a suspended six-month prison sentence for ""acts of violence (...) committed because of the race or ethnicity of the victim."" Chalureau was sacked by Toulouse after the decision before joining their Top 14 rivals Montpellier.During the World Cup, former France captain Thierry Dusautoir said he had a problem with Chalureau's presence in the national team. Former Toulouse flanker Dusautoir is a close friend of one of the victims.French President Emmanuel Macron had said it would be preferable that Chalureau no longer played for France if his appeal failed. Some politicians had asked for Chalureau to be withdrawn from France's World Cup squad due to the incident.The decision is set to be announced less than three weeks before France's next game, when they start the 2024 Six Nations against Ireland on February 2 in Marseille.",Sports,french judge recommended tuesday march france lock bastien chalureau handed eight month suspended prison sentence racially motivated attack second row chalureau part frances rugby world cup squad earlier year originally given six month suspended sentence appealed recommendations toulouse court appeal judge suggested heavier sentence two months longer chalureaus original one facts established judge said adding complainants spoke undeniably racist remarks courts decision regarding judges recommendation expected january greatly regret racist chalureau admitted consumed lot beer whiskey vodka evening attack told court never made inappropriate comment toward anyone worked psychologist ive changed lifestyle court case overshadowed start frances world cup campaign knocked eventual winners south africa quarter finals last month chalureau played half hour campaign called replace injured paul willemse montpelliers chalureau accepted attacked two rugby players night january denies using racist language incident took place toulouse chalureau played towns top flight club november toulouse court sentenced chalureau suspended six month prison sentence acts violence committed race ethnicity victim chalureau sacked toulouse decision joining top rivals montpellier world cup former france captain thierry dusautoir said problem chalureaus presence national team former toulouse flanker dusautoir close friend one victims french president emmanuel macron said would preferable chalureau longer played france appeal failed politicians asked chalureau withdrawn frances world cup squad due incident decision set announced less three weeks frances next game start six nations ireland february marseille,french judg recommend tuesday march franc lock bastien chalureau hand eight month suspend prison sentenc racial motiv attack second row chalureau part franc rugbi world cup squad earlier year origin given six month suspend sentenc appeal recommend toulous court appeal judg suggest heavier sentenc two month longer chalureau origin one fact establish judg said ad complain spoke undeni racist remark court decis regard judg recommend expect januari greatli regret racist chalureau admit consum lot beer whiskey vodka even attack told court never made inappropri comment toward anyon work psychologist ive chang lifestyl court case overshadow start franc world cup campaign knock eventu winner south africa quarter final last month chalureau play half hour campaign call replac injur paul willems montpelli chalureau accept attack two rugbi player night januari deni use racist languag incid took place toulous chalureau play town top flight club novemb toulous court sentenc chalureau suspend six month prison sentenc act violenc commit race ethnic victim chalureau sack toulous decis join top rival montpelli world cup former franc captain thierri dusautoir said problem chalureau presenc nation team former toulous flanker dusautoir close friend one victim french presid emmanuel macron said would prefer chalureau longer play franc appeal fail politician ask chalureau withdrawn franc world cup squad due incid decis set announc less three week franc next game start six nation ireland februari marseil
US Internal Revenue Service demands Microsoft pay $29 billion in unpaid taxes,"    US tech giants' accounting practices have raised concerns, with governments alleging that firms like Apple, Amazon and Microsoft use low-tax jurisdictions to reduce taxes in their primary markets and boost profits. ","The US Internal Revenue Service is asking that Microsoft pay a whopping $29 billion in unpaid taxes from 2004 to 2013, the company said in an official filing on Wednesday, October 11. The case puts further focus on the international tax practices of major multinationals that have been accused in recent years of shifting revenue to lower tax jurisdictions in an effort to avoid higher taxes in their major markets.""We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the (demand) through the IRS's administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings,"" the company said in its filing to the US markets authority. In a blog post, Microsoft said the issue with the IRS was with its transferring of revenue across international jurisdictions during the period. The practice, called cost-sharing, is used by ""many large multinationals...because it reflects the global nature of their business,"" the company said. ""We strongly believe we have acted in accordance with IRS rules and regulations and that our position is supported by case law,"" the blog post added.Reached by AFP, the IRS said it was against US law for it to either confirm or deny an ongoing tax case. Microsoft said that the appeal process with the IRS would take years and if it failed, the company would fight the claim in the courts. The Windows maker said the demand emerged out of a decade-long discussion with the IRS ""about how we allocated our income and expenses for tax years beginning as far back as 2004."" ""We have changed our corporate structure and practices since the years covered by the audit, and as a result, the issues raised by the IRS are relevant to the past but not to our current practices,"" it said. Microsoft added that ""since 2004, we have paid over $67 billion in taxes to the US.""The accounting practices of US big tech companies have long posed a problem for authorities. Governments have accused companies such as Apple, Amazon or Microsoft of shifting revenue through low or zero-tax jurisdictions in order to escape taxation in their main markets and maximize profits. This spurred a major international agreement among 140 countries brokered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that is designed to better share and regulate the tax revenue of the giants.The OECD on Wednesday published a draft agreement implementing a major part of that deal with hopes of having it ratified by the end of the year. In the EU, authorities in 2016 ordered Apple to pay €13 billion in back taxes over similar accounting practices, but Brussels lost an appeal to Apple and is awaiting the outcome of a further appeal.",Pixels,internal revenue service asking microsoft pay whopping billion unpaid taxes company said official filing wednesday october case puts focus international tax practices major multinationals accused recent years shifting revenue lower tax jurisdictions effort avoid higher taxes major markets disagree proposed adjustments vigorously contest demand irss administrative appeals office necessary judicial proceedings company said filing markets authority blog post microsoft said issue irs transferring revenue across international jurisdictions period practice called cost sharing used many large multinationals reflects global nature business company said strongly believe acted accordance irs rules regulations position supported case law blog post added reached afp irs said law either confirm deny ongoing tax case microsoft said appeal process irs would take years failed company would fight claim courts windows maker said demand emerged decade long discussion irs allocated income expenses tax years beginning far back changed corporate structure practices since years covered audit result issues raised irs relevant past current practices said microsoft added since paid billion taxes accounting practices big tech companies long posed problem authorities governments accused companies apple amazon microsoft shifting revenue low zero tax jurisdictions order escape taxation main markets maximize profits spurred major international agreement among countries brokered organization economic cooperation development oecd designed better share regulate tax revenue giants oecd wednesday published draft agreement implementing major part deal hopes ratified end year authorities ordered apple pay billion back taxes similar accounting practices brussels lost appeal apple awaiting outcome appeal,intern revenu servic ask microsoft pay whop billion unpaid tax compani said offici file wednesday octob case put focu intern tax practic major multin accus recent year shift revenu lower tax jurisdict effort avoid higher tax major market disagre propos adjust vigor contest demand irss administr appeal offic necessari judici proceed compani said file market author blog post microsoft said issu ir transfer revenu across intern jurisdict period practic call cost share use mani larg multin reflect global natur busi compani said strongli believ act accord ir rule regul posit support case law blog post ad reach afp ir said law either confirm deni ongo tax case microsoft said appeal process ir would take year fail compani would fight claim court window maker said demand emerg decad long discuss ir alloc incom expens tax year begin far back chang corpor structur practic sinc year cover audit result issu rais ir relev past current practic said microsoft ad sinc paid billion tax account practic big tech compani long pose problem author govern accus compani appl amazon microsoft shift revenu low zero tax jurisdict order escap taxat main market maxim profit spur major intern agreement among countri broker organ econom cooper develop oecd design better share regul tax revenu giant oecd wednesday publish draft agreement implement major part deal hope ratifi end year author order appl pay billion back tax similar account practic brussel lost appeal appl await outcom appeal

'Marvel's Spider-Man 2' video game is visually stunning but not much else,    Spider-Man's new adventure lets players explore a breath-taking New York City but its plot and gameplay are underwhelming. ,"Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is like catching a glimpse of an old acquaintance whose familiar face, from a distance, has not changed. The latest creation from the California-based Insomniac Games succeeds Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020), the launch title for PlayStation 5 (PS5), and Marvel's Spider-Man (2018), one of the PS4's best-selling games, with over 20 million copies sold.However, it would be wrong to pretend not to have recognized this old friend: While nothing has fundamentally changed in the game, which will be available on PS5 on October 20, there is now an added maturity. It's no longer just one Spider-Man, but two who guide the story: 25-year-old Peter Parker and 17-year-old Miles Morales, whose destinies alternate and intertwine.The world, too, has doubled in size. In addition to the island of Manhattan, there are now neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens. A flying suit takes us from one side of this enlarged map to the other, where we can pick up numerous secondary objectives, glean experience or collect bonuses that will allow our characters to evolve.As nimble as Spider-Man, this blockbuster has shrugged off the weight of time despite its unsurprising specifications. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is striking in its ability to capture the torments of adolescence. We accompany Miles Morales as he tries to cope with the death of his father. But we also follow Peter Parker, now endowed with the dark powers of Venom, as a metaphor for his passage to adulthood.The gameplay, which alternates spectacular action phases, simplistic puzzles, teenage comedy scenes and rooftop exploration of the American metropolis, will appeal to those of the same age as its superheroes. For the rest of us, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is as regressive and comforting as a tub of popcorn with a movie. It will appeal to both fans of teen movies and those who grew up with Sam Raimi's comics or films. The latter fans will appreciate this rather classic but solid retelling of the universe after the experimental – and stunning – approach of the animated film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, released in May.For others, the splendid New York panoramas presented here will arouse some unexpected nostalgia: for all the films and TV series that have used the same skyline. Arriving in Little Odessa brought back memories of James Gray's 1994 film of the same name. It's hard to pass in front of the Washington Square Park arch without thinking of Rob Reiner's When Harry Met Sally (1989), or to refrain from looking for the street on which the Manhattan Bridge in Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America (1984) was filmed.Add to this references to the history of New York music, from jazz (a secondary mission consists of recovering Charlie ""Bird"" Parker's saxophone) to hip-hop. And we find ourselves transformed into a veritable video game tourist within the iconic metropolis, tempted to switch to photo mode at every evocative street corner.It's an exploration full of surprises and details that almost made us forget that the main plot (a story of bloody safari, in which the supervillain Kraven is the hunter and characters endowed with superpowers his prey) seemed a little lacking. In the face of the ambition of other open-world games on offer this year, such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or Starfield, this Spider-Man is in the end rather faithful to the character traits of its original hero Peter Parker: modest but charming.We liked:We liked less:It's more for you if:It's not for you if:6 spider legs out of 8.",Pixels,marvels spider man like catching glimpse old acquaintance whose familiar face distance changed latest creation california based insomniac games succeeds marvels spider man miles morales launch title playstation marvels spider man one best selling games million copies sold however would wrong pretend recognized old friend nothing fundamentally changed game available october added maturity longer one spider man two guide story year old peter parker year old miles morales whose destinies alternate intertwine world doubled size addition island manhattan neighborhoods brooklyn queens flying suit takes one side enlarged map pick numerous secondary objectives glean experience collect bonuses allow characters evolve nimble spider man blockbuster shrugged weight time despite unsurprising specifications marvels spider man striking ability capture torments adolescence accompany miles morales tries cope death father also follow peter parker endowed dark powers venom metaphor passage adulthood gameplay alternates spectacular action phases simplistic puzzles teenage comedy scenes rooftop exploration american metropolis appeal age superheroes rest marvels spider man regressive comforting tub popcorn movie appeal fans teen movies grew sam raimis comics films latter fans appreciate rather classic solid retelling universe experimental stunning approach animated film spider man across spider verse released may others splendid new york panoramas presented arouse unexpected nostalgia films series used skyline arriving little odessa brought back memories james grays film name hard pass front washington square park arch without thinking rob reiners harry met sally refrain looking street manhattan bridge sergio leones upon time america filmed add references history new york music jazz secondary mission consists recovering charlie bird parkers saxophone hip hop find transformed veritable video game tourist within iconic metropolis tempted switch photo mode every evocative street corner exploration full surprises details almost made forget main plot story bloody safari supervillain kraven hunter characters endowed superpowers prey seemed little lacking face ambition open world games offer year legend zelda tears kingdom starfield spider man end rather faithful character traits original hero peter parker modest charming liked liked less spider legs,marvel spider man like catch glimps old acquaint whose familiar face distanc chang latest creation california base insomniac game succe marvel spider man mile moral launch titl playstat marvel spider man one best sell game million copi sold howev would wrong pretend recogn old friend noth fundament chang game avail octob ad matur longer one spider man two guid stori year old peter parker year old mile moral whose destini altern intertwin world doubl size addit island manhattan neighborhood brooklyn queen fli suit take one side enlarg map pick numer secondari object glean experi collect bonus allow charact evolv nimbl spider man blockbust shrug weight time despit unsurpris specif marvel spider man strike abil captur torment adolesc accompani mile moral tri cope death father also follow peter parker endow dark power venom metaphor passag adulthood gameplay altern spectacular action phase simplist puzzl teenag comedi scene rooftop explor american metropoli appeal age superhero rest marvel spider man regress comfort tub popcorn movi appeal fan teen movi grew sam raimi comic film latter fan appreci rather classic solid retel univers experiment stun approach anim film spider man across spider vers releas may other splendid new york panorama present arous unexpect nostalgia film seri use skylin arriv littl odessa brought back memori jame gray film name hard pass front washington squar park arch without think rob reiner harri met salli refrain look street manhattan bridg sergio leon upon time america film add refer histori new york music jazz secondari mission consist recov charli bird parker saxophon hip hop find transform verit video game tourist within icon metropoli tempt switch photo mode everi evoc street corner explor full surpris detail almost made forget main plot stori bloodi safari supervillain kraven hunter charact endow superpow prey seem littl lack face ambit open world game offer year legend zelda tear kingdom starfield spider man end rather faith charact trait origin hero peter parker modest charm like like less spider leg
Israel-Hamas war: Social media platforms caught up in accusations of 'partisan' moderation,"    For the past 10 days, Facebook, X, YouTube and TikTok have been accused of alternately 'censoring' pro-Palestinian accounts or of inaction against Hamas. ","Since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, and even more so since the start of the Israeli strikes on Gaza, social networks have been accused of siding either with the Palestinians or, more often, with Israel. There have been accusations of ""censorship"" or, at the very least, unequal treatment. As early as October 10, Elon Musk, the chairman of X (formerly Twitter), posted a meme on his personal account mocking the ""mainstream media,"" which, he claimed, simultaneously accused his platform of being ""an anti-Semitic cesspool"" and ""a Zionist propaganda machine.""More than the media, it is above all the users of the major social media platforms, and mainly Palestinians and defenders of the Palestinian cause, who have been behind the proliferation of ""censorship"" accusations leveled at platforms over the past week. A simple search on any social media network will bring up hundreds of accounts from users claiming to have been shadow banned: a practice that consists of not closing an account but reducing its visibility by limiting its appearance in news feeds or searches.The practice of shadow banning exists on all the leading platforms, even if they all dispute the term, which is considered too loaded. On X, YouTube, Facebook or TikTok, accounts that have been the subject of numerous reports or have been repeatedly sanctioned for breaking the rules can find themselves partly made ""invisible."" Similarly, a post containing violent images or suspicious keywords will automatically be less widely circulated than average.For the past week, it's mainly been TikTok and Instagram – two platforms very popular with teenagers and young adults – that have been accused of hiding pro-Palestinian messages, or even of ""doing Israel's bidding."" ""The suggestion that we're trying to suppress a particular community or point of view is categorically untrue,"" replied Meta (owner of Instagram). ""Our policies are designed to give everyone a voice while keeping people safe on our apps, and we apply these policies regardless of who is posting or their personal beliefs."" The company also explained that it has corrected a bug that made certain Stories not very visible, but asserted that the problem had been widespread.With the exception of the special case of Telegram, which does little or no moderation, all the major platforms have announced that they have applied very similar rules since the Hamas attack. TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube explain that they have deployed more moderators, including Hebrew or Arabic speakers; taken steps to limit live video broadcasts, which are more difficult to moderate; and say they apply ""public interest rules"" on a case-by-case basis. This may lead them to leave normally forbidden content online – typically graphic images that are evidence of an incident. X is the only major social media platform not to have announced an increase in its moderation staff. Since Elon Musk's takeover of the company a year ago, most of the service providers handling the site's moderation have not been retained.",Pixels,since hamas attack israel october even since start israeli strikes gaza social networks accused siding either palestinians often israel accusations censorship least unequal treatment early october elon musk chairman formerly twitter posted meme personal account mocking mainstream media claimed simultaneously accused platform anti semitic cesspool zionist propaganda machine media users major social media platforms mainly palestinians defenders palestinian cause behind proliferation censorship accusations leveled platforms past week simple search social media network bring hundreds accounts users claiming shadow banned practice consists closing account reducing visibility limiting appearance news feeds searches practice shadow banning exists leading platforms even dispute term considered loaded youtube facebook tiktok accounts subject numerous reports repeatedly sanctioned breaking rules find partly made invisible similarly post containing violent images sus keywords automatically less widely circulated average past week mainly tiktok instagram two platforms popular teenagers young adults accused hiding pro palestinian messages even israels bidding suggestion trying suppress particular community point view categorically untrue replied meta owner instagram policies designed give everyone voice keeping people safe apps apply policies regardless posting personal beliefs company also explained corrected bug made certain stories visible asserted problem widespread exception special case telegram little moderation major platforms announced applied similar rules since hamas attack tiktok instagram facebook youtube explain deployed moderators including hebrew arabic speakers taken steps limit live video broadcasts difficult moderate say apply public interest rules case case basis may lead leave normally forbidden content online graphic images evidence incident major social media platform announced increase moderation staff since elon musks takeover company year ago service providers handling sites moderation retained,sinc hama attack israel octob even sinc start isra strike gaza social network accus side either palestinian often israel accus censorship least unequ treatment earli octob elon musk chairman formerli twitter post meme person account mock mainstream media claim simultan accus platform anti semit cesspool zionist propaganda machin media user major social media platform mainli palestinian defend palestinian caus behind prolifer censorship accus level platform past week simpl search social media network bring hundr account user claim shadow ban practic consist close account reduc visibl limit appear news feed search practic shadow ban exist lead platform even disput term consid load youtub facebook tiktok account subject numer report repeatedli sanction break rule find partli made invis similarli post contain violent imag su keyword automat less wide circul averag past week mainli tiktok instagram two platform popular teenag young adult accus hide pro palestinian messag even israel bid suggest tri suppress particular commun point view categor untru repli meta owner instagram polici design give everyon voic keep peopl safe app appli polici regardless post person belief compani also explain correct bug made certain stori visibl assert problem widespread except special case telegram littl moder major platform announc appli similar rule sinc hama attack tiktok instagram facebook youtub explain deploy moder includ hebrew arab speaker taken step limit live video broadcast difficult moder say appli public interest rule case case basi may lead leav normal forbidden content onlin graphic imag evid incid major social media platform announc increas moder staff sinc elon musk takeov compani year ago servic provid handl site moder retain
US states sue Meta over harm to youth mental health,    Dozens of US states have filed a lawsuit accusing the company of contributing to the youth mental health crisis by designing features on its social media platforms to be addictive for young users. ,"Dozens of US states on Tuesday, October 24, accused Facebook and Instagram owner Meta of profiting ""from children's pain,"" damaging their mental health and misleading people about the safety of its platforms. ""In seeking to maximize its financial gains, Meta has repeatedly misled the public about the substantial dangers of its Social Media Platforms,"" argued a joint lawsuit filed in federal court in California.In total more than 40 states are suing Meta, though some opted to file in local courts rather than join in the federal case. Meta has exploited young users by creating a business model designed to maximize the time they spend on the platform despite harm to their health, the legal filing argued.""Kids and teenagers are suffering from record levels of poor mental health and social media companies like Meta are to blame,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement announcing the suit. ""Meta has profited from children's pain by intentionally designing its platforms with manipulative features that make children addicted to their platforms while lowering their self-esteem.""The suit accuses Meta of deceptive and unlawful conduct harming vulnerable youth for financial gain. The suit urges the federal court to order Meta to stop manipulative tactics and pay hefty financial penalties along with restitution, according to James. ""Social media companies, including Meta, have contributed to a national youth mental health crisis and they must be held accountable,"" James said.Meta said it was ""disappointed"" by the suit and that the states were not working with the array of social media companies to create age-appropriate standards. Meta maintained that it has developed more than 30 tools in its apps to support teenage users, and made it easier for parents to ""shape"" online activity.The Silicon Valley tech firm contended it is disappointing that attorneys general have singled out Meta instead of seeking industry-wide solutions given the popularity of rivals including TikTok, YouTube and Snap. Social media can also be a place where young people struggling with other issues in their lives go to find support of community, Meta maintained.The legal complaints resulted from a nationwide investigation announced in November of 2021, according to California attorney general Rob Bonta. ""Our bipartisan investigation has arrived at a solemn conclusion: Meta has been harming our children and teens, cultivating addiction to boost corporate profits,"" Bonta said in a release.

The EU and the UK diverge in strategies to regulate AI,"    On October 24, the EU aims to finalize the Artificial Intelligence Act. In November, the UK and Japan will host AI summits. However, despite their shared interest in AI, national strategies vary. ","OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Meta aren't the only ones racing to play leading roles in artificial intelligence (AI). Political leaders are also vying with each other to create frameworks for – and to promote – software capable of performing human tasks, such as text and image generators ChatGPT and Midjourney. On Tuesday, October 24, the European Union hopes to reach a political agreement on the Artificial Intelligence Act, or at least compromise on the main points of this draft regulation.Then, on November 1 and 2, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will welcome representatives of foreign governments and tech giants to London for an ""international AI safety summit."" Later in November, the G7 countries will gather for a meeting on the ""Hiroshima Process,"" an AI discussion that began in Japan in May.This convergence illustrates a sense of political urgency to take hold of a technology considered at once highly promising and worrying. But in this frenzy – the US, the OECD and China are also active – strategies differ.In 2021, Brussels launched the world's first major legislative project on AI: The AI Act prohibits certain uses (""social rating"" systems, ""subliminal techniques"" for manipulation), and for uses deemed ""high-risk"" (autonomous driving, screening resumes, granting bank loans), it imposes obligations, such as minimizing error rates and discriminatory biases, checking the quality of training data, etc.On the controversial point of ""general-purpose"" AI models (such as those generating text or images), the path of compromise between the European Parliament and the member states consists of imposing obligations on the largest models (above a threshold of computing used for training, or a number of users or corporate clients in the EU, according to a document cited by Contexte). Software manufacturers should also ensure that they have taken steps to respect the ""copyright"" of content used for training.As for London, which wants to become an AI capital, it has chosen to focus on the risks deemed most existential. According to a draft joint declaration from the summit, reviewed by Euractiv, these are linked to ""intentional misuse"" – to generate computer attacks or biological weapons – or to ""issues of control"" of an AI that could escape humans. The statement is reminiscent of alarmist letters calling for AI to be ""paused,"" or deeming it as dangerous as ""pandemics or nuclear war.""The British approach also matches the rhetoric of the industry giants: The summit focuses on ""frontier AI models,"" the term used by OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Anthropic when they created an industry group of the most powerful software manufacturers in June. London also aims to create a kind of ""IPCC of AI,"" a panel of experts inspired by the one charged with informing governments about climate – an idea also championed, in an op-ed in the Financial Times, by several executives working in the field of AI.",Pixels,openai google microsoft meta arent ones racing play leading roles artificial intelligence political leaders also vying create frameworks promote software capable performing human tasks text image generators chatgpt midjourney tuesday october european union hopes reach political agreement artificial intelligence act least compromise main points draft regulation november british prime minister rishi sunak welcome representatives foreign governments tech giants london international safety summit later november countries gather meeting hiroshima process discussion began japan may convergence illustrates sense political urgency take hold technology considered highly promising worrying frenzy oecd china also active strategies differ brussels launched worlds first major legislative project act prohibits certain uses social rating systems subliminal techniques manipulation uses deemed high risk autonomous driving screening resumes granting bank loans imposes obligations minimizing error rates discriminatory biases checking quality training data etc controversial point general purpose models generating text images path compromise european parliament member states consists imposing obligations largest models threshold computing used training number users corporate clients according document cited contexte software manufacturers also ensure taken steps respect copyright content used training london wants become capital chosen focus risks deemed existential according draft joint declaration summit reviewed euractiv linked intentional misuse generate computer attacks biological weapons issues control could escape humans statement reminiscent alarmist letters calling paused deeming dangerous pandemics nuclear war british approach also matches rhetoric industry giants summit focuses frontier models term used openai google microsoft anthro created industry group powerful software manufacturers june london also aims create kind ipcc panel experts inspired one charged informing governments climate idea also championed financial times several executives working field,openai googl microsoft meta arent one race play lead role artifici intellig polit leader also vy creat framework promot softwar capabl perform human task text imag gener chatgpt midjourney tuesday octob european union hope reach polit agreement artifici intellig act least compromis main point draft regul novemb british prime minist rishi sunak welcom repres foreign govern tech giant london intern safeti summit later novemb countri gather meet hiroshima process discuss began japan may converg illustr sens polit urgenc take hold technolog consid highli promis worri frenzi oecd china also activ strategi differ brussel launch world first major legisl project act prohibit certain use social rate system sublimin techniqu manipul use deem high risk autonom drive screen resum grant bank loan impos oblig minim error rate discriminatori bias check qualiti train data etc controversi point gener purpos model gener text imag path compromis european parliament member state consist impos oblig largest model threshold comput use train number user corpor client accord document cite context softwar manufactur also ensur taken step respect copyright content use train london want becom capit chosen focu risk deem existenti accord draft joint declar summit review euractiv link intent misus gener comput attack biolog weapon issu control could escap human statement reminisc alarmist letter call paus deem danger pandem nuclear war british approach also match rhetor industri giant summit focus frontier model term use openai googl microsoft anthro creat industri group power softwar manufactur june london also aim creat kind ipcc panel expert inspir one charg inform govern climat idea also champion financi time sever execut work field
"Encryption 'backdoors,' an unenforceable yet recurring political objective","French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said that he would like to force encrypted messaging services to introduce 'backdoors' to make them available to authorities. Although this proposal regularly crops up in political discussions, it remains impossible to implement.","Interviewed on BFM-TV on Thursday, October 19, Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin pointed to a convenient target to explain why the terrorist who murdered French teacher Dominique Bernard in Arras on Friday, October 13, was able to act even though he was under close surveillance by intelligence services: messaging applications.""Until recently, traditional phone tapping gave us information about serious crime and terrorism. Today, people use Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, Facebook, etc. (...) These are encrypted messaging systems (...) We need to be able to negotiate what you call a 'back door' with these companies. We need to be able to say, 'Mr. Whatsapp, Mr. Telegram, I suspect that Mr. X may be about to do something, give me his conversations.'""The argument seems to be based on common sense, and Darmanin has said he is in favor of changing the law to require platforms to provide the content of encrypted messages when requested by the authorities. The problem, however, is that these requests run counter to laws that are far more difficult to change than those of the France: the laws of mathematics.The ""end-to-end"" encryption used by applications such as Signal and WhatsApp works on a simple principle: it makes messages readable only by the sender and the recipient. When you send a photo, a link or a few words to a friend on Signal, for example, only the recipient has the ""key"" to open the virtual padlock which makes the message unreadable. Not even the messaging app administrator knows the key.If a message is intercepted in transit from one phone or computer to another, it will only be possible to see a sequence of incomprehensible numbers and letters that are virtually impossible to decipher, given the robustness of today's algorithms. What's more, these applications do not keep copies of transmitted messages. It is therefore impossible to ask ""Mr. Whatsapp"" or ""Mr. Telegram"" to provide messages after the fact.As things stand, the only effective way for investigators to read the content of WhatsApp or Signal conversations is simply to gain access to the phones or computers used by one or more participants in a conversation. In fact, Darmanin pointed out that this is what the agents monitoring the perpetrator of the Arras attack had tried to do, by stopping him the day before the attack in the hope of getting their hands on his cell phone, without success.The process is random, which is why Darmanin – like a long list of politicians around the world before him – is calling for the creation of a ""back door."" In practical terms, this means requiring companies that manage messaging applications to provide the authorities with a ""secret key"" that can decrypt any message, or intentionally slip a loophole into the encryption algorithm to then give government services access.",Pixels,interviewed bfm thursday october interior minister rald darmanin pointed convenient target explain terrorist murdered french teacher dominique bernard arras friday october able act even though close surveillance intelligence services messaging applications recently traditional phone tapping gave information serious crime terrorism today people use telegram whatsapp signal facebook etc encrypted messaging systems need able negotiate call back door companies need able say whatsapp telegram suspect may something give conversations argument seems based common sense darmanin said favor changing law require platforms provide content encrypted messages requested authorities problem however requests run counter laws far difficult change france laws mathematics end end encryption used applications signal whatsapp works simple principle makes messages readable sender recipient send photo link words friend signal example recipient key open virtual padlock makes message unreadable even messaging app administrator knows key message intercepted transit one phone computer another possible see sequence incomprehensible numbers letters virtually impossible decipher given robustness todays algorithms whats applications keep copies transmitted messages therefore impossible ask whatsapp telegram provide messages fact things stand effective way investigators read content whatsapp signal conversations simply gain access phones computers used one participants conversation fact darmanin pointed agents monitoring perpetrator arras attack tried stopping day attack hope getting hands cell phone without success process random darmanin like long list politicians around world calling creation back door practical terms means requiring companies manage messaging applications provide authorities secret key decrypt message intentionally slip loophole encryption algorithm give government services access,interview bfm thursday octob interior minist rald darmanin point conveni target explain terrorist murder french teacher dominiqu bernard arra friday octob abl act even though close surveil intellig servic messag applic recent tradit phone tap gave inform seriou crime terror today peopl use telegram whatsapp signal facebook etc encrypt messag system need abl negoti call back door compani need abl say whatsapp telegram suspect may someth give convers argument seem base common sens darmanin said favor chang law requir platform provid content encrypt messag request author problem howev request run counter law far difficult chang franc law mathemat end end encrypt use applic signal whatsapp work simpl principl make messag readabl sender recipi send photo link word friend signal exampl recipi key open virtual padlock make messag unread even messag app administr know key messag intercept transit one phone comput anoth possibl see sequenc incomprehens number letter virtual imposs deciph given robust today algorithm what applic keep copi transmit messag therefor imposs ask whatsapp telegram provid messag fact thing stand effect way investig read content whatsapp signal convers simpli gain access phone comput use one particip convers fact darmanin point agent monitor perpetr arra attack tri stop day attack hope get hand cell phone without success process random darmanin like long list politician around world call creation back door practic term mean requir compani manag messag applic provid author secret key decrypt messag intent slip loophol encrypt algorithm give govern servic access
Alphabet and Microsoft report strong profits driven by AI and cloud computing,"    While Microsoft's Azure cloud service outpaces expectations with 29% revenue growth, Alphabet faces challenges in its cloud division, prompting various investor reactions. ","Google parent Alphabet and computing colossus Microsoft Tuesday, October 24, reported that quarterly profits climbed on demand for cloud computing enhanced with artificial intelligence. Microsoft saw its shares rise more than 3 percent to $341.11 on earnings which underscored the momentum of its cloud business. Alphabet share prices, however, slipped more than 5 percent to $129.67 in after-market trades Tuesday despite beating overall earnings expectations as investors had evidently hoped Google Cloud would be doing better.""Google Cloud missed consensus revenue expectations on slowing growth, and we believe consistent with the view that newer (generative artificial intelligence) workloads will take time to move the needle,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note to investors. Alphabet reported a quarterly profit of $19.7 billion, powered by money taken in from ads, YouTube, and cloud services. Alphabet logged $76.7 billion in revenue, versus $69 billion in the same period a year earlier.""We see AI as a foundational platform shift and are excited about the opportunities across our business,"" Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai said during an earnings call. ""Through it all we are making sure the product works well and we are generating value."" Consumers and investors have been keenly watching how companies take advantage of artificial intelligence, and Google along with Microsoft and OpenAI are considered leaders in the technology.But Alphabet has largely been seen as playing catch up with Microsoft, with questions over whether the mighty Google search engine will withstand developments in AI. Microsoft was quick to beef up its Bing search engine with AI powers, but Google's search has yet to see a real threat to its dominance and continues to hold about 90 percent of the market worldwide.Google, like most big tech companies, saw its share price rise steeply in 2023 as investors expected AI to generate new revenue and open new markets. ""It is a testament to the nature of Google's market dominance in search and ads that it can beat (earnings) estimates and have its stock sag immediately afterwards,"" said Insider Intelligence analyst Max Willens. ""Cloud computing is a much lumpier business than advertising, and one where Google is facing stiff competition.""While Google may gain traction making money from AI in the long run, its Cloud unit for now is not enough to sate investors, Willens added. Revenue in Alphabet's cloud division, which infuses AI into its services, was $8.4 billion in the quarter, compared to $6.7 billion in the same period a year earlier.Tech giant Microsoft said Tuesday its profits rose in the latest quarter, boosted by its strength in the closely watched cloud services segment. The company exceeded expectations to report a net income of $22.3 billion for the July to September period, up 27 percent from a year ago. All eyes have been on Microsoft's artificial intelligence and cloud computing performance, and a key aspect is the Azure cloud service, which competes with Amazon's AWS and Google Cloud.""We're making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere,"" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said on an earnings call. ""We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role in the business process to drive productivity gains.""In the latest quarter, revenue growth for Azure and other cloud services came in at 29 percent from a year ago, a slightly faster pace than the three months prior. Overall, the company reported $56.5 billion in sales for the quarter, also higher than anticipated. Microsoft shares surged by 4.6 percent in after-hours trading.The latest earnings report comes shortly after Microsoft closed its blockbuster acquisition of Activision Blizzard, whose video games

UN chief establishes panel to advise on global governance of artificial intelligence,"    UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Thursday announced the appointment of a global advisory panel to report on international governance of artificial intelligence and its risks, challenges and key opportunities. ","The UN secretary-general on Thursday, October 26, set up a panel of experts to make recommendations in the field of artificial intelligence, a technology with ""transformative potential"" yet also great risks to democracy and human rights. ""The last year has seen an extraordinary advance in the capabilities and use of artificial intelligence (AI), through chatbots, voice cloning, image generators, video apps and more,"" Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.He called on the panel to race ""against the clock"" and make recommendations on how to govern the use of AI by the end of 2023, identifying the risks it poses and the opportunities it presents. ""In our challenging times, AI could power extraordinary progress for humanity,"" Guterres said, referring to advances in areas like public health, education and even the fight against climate change. ""But all this depends on AI technologies being harnessed responsibly.""He said the groundbreaking technology is ""concentrated in a handful of companies and countries."" ""The potential harms of AI extend to serious concerns over misinformation and disinformation; the entrenching of bias and discrimination; surveillance and invasion of privacy; fraud, and other violations of human rights,"" he warned. Guterres said he didn't want to enter into doomsday scenarios, but noted that ""AI could undermine trust in institutions, weaken social cohesion, and threaten democracy itself.""Guterres picked some 40 experts in technology, law and personal data protection – coming from academia, government and the private sector – to sit on the panel.

"One year after his Twitter takeover, has Elon Musk kept his promises?",News analysis,"On October 26, 2022, Elon Musk entered Twitter headquarters in San Francisco, California, laughing, carrying a washbasin. After several months of a rocky soap opera, the richest man in the world (at the time) was about to finalize the takeover of the social media network for $44 billion (€41.6 billion) and take possession of the platform.In previous months, the creator of SpaceX set out his vision for relaunching the firm with the bluebird logo and made a whole series of commitments. A year on, these promises, as is often the case with Musk, have not really been kept.Before, during and after the Twitter takeover, Musk said again and again: Transparency is the cardinal virtue that conditions all others, especially for a social media network. Under his leadership, the platform would post moderation sanctions transparently, and he would make the source code of its algorithms public.Above all, over the past year, the billionaire has demonstrated a rather peculiar, even partisan, conception of transparency. In December 2022, he gave internal company documents and messages from the time under the previous management to a handful of conservative or libertarian journalists that he selected. The ""Twitter Files,"" as he then called them, were intended to show that his precursors had censored conservative users and responded favorably to US government requisitions well beyond what the law required.The published articles do reveal mistakes and questionable choices on the part of Twitter's top executives, as well as possibly outrageous demands on the part of the US federal government. But most of the information contained in the ""Twitter Files"" was already known.Since then, Musk has not engaged in any transparency operations on his social media network. The entire staff of the communications department was dismissed and the company no longer responds to any media requests. For several months, any e-mail sent to his press department received an automated ""poop"" emoji as a response.If Musk is to be believed, freedom of speech was his main motivation for buying Twitter: to put an end to the ""censorship"" that he felt affected many users, particularly conservatives. ""I'm against censorship that goes far beyond the law,"" he explained in April 2022. From his very first days at the head of the social media network, he reinstated the accounts of several people who had been banned – unfairly in his eyes, including comedians or journalists, former president Donald Trump, along with neo-Nazi and conspiracy activists.",Pixels,october elon musk entered twitter headquarters san francisco california laughing carrying washbasin several months rocky soap opera richest man world time finalize takeover social media network billion billion take possession platform previous months creator spacex set vision relaunching firm bluebird logo made whole series commitments year promises often case musk really kept twitter takeover musk said transparency cardinal virtue conditions others especially social media network leadership platform would post moderation sanctions transparently would make source code algorithms public past year billionaire demonstrated rather peculiar even partisan conception transparency december gave internal company documents messages time previous management handful conservative libertarian journalists selected twitter files called intended show precursors censored conservative users responded favorably government requisitions well beyond law required published articles reveal mistakes questionable choices part twitters top executives well possibly outrageous demands part federal government information contained twitter files already known since musk engaged transparency operations social media network entire staff communications department dismissed company longer responds media requests several months mail sent press department received automated poop emoji response musk believed freedom speech main motivation buying twitter put end censorship felt affected many users particularly conservatives censorship goes far beyond law explained april first days head social media network reinstated accounts several people banned unfairly eyes including comedians journalists former president donald trump along neo nazi conspiracy activists,octob elon musk enter twitter headquart san francisco california laugh carri washbasin sever month rocki soap opera richest man world time final takeov social media network billion billion take possess platform previou month creator spacex set vision relaunch firm bluebird logo made whole seri commit year promis often case musk realli kept twitter takeov musk said transpar cardin virtu condit other especi social media network leadership platform would post moder sanction transpar would make sourc code algorithm public past year billionair demonstr rather peculiar even partisan concept transpar decemb gave intern compani document messag time previou manag hand conserv libertarian journalist select twitter file call intend show precursor censor conserv user respond favor govern requisit well beyond law requir publish articl reveal mistak question choic part twitter top execut well possibl outrag demand part feder govern inform contain twitter file alreadi known sinc musk engag transpar oper social media network entir staff commun depart dismiss compani longer respond media request sever month mail sent press depart receiv autom poop emoji respons musk believ freedom speech main motiv buy twitter put end censorship felt affect mani user particularli conserv censorship goe far beyond law explain april first day head social media network reinstat account sever peopl ban unfairli eye includ comedian journalist former presid donald trump along neo nazi conspiraci activist
"In Montreal too, being a woman in tech is not that easy","    In this Quebec hub of artificial intelligence research, women hold only 22% of sector positions, mostly in human resources, not in developer roles. Gender stereotypes are a major barrier to recruitment, although female success stories do exist. ","""Let's take power!"" Marie-José Montpetit, a doctor of electrical and computer engineering, was invited to participate in a discussion in Montreal in March focusing on the role of women in the fields of science, technology, and artificial intelligence (AI). She promoted the idea that ""jobs in innovation are fascinating because it's here that we have the power to change the world.""To hear this sexagenarian from Quebec with a dazzling career behind her – 20 years working for the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) computer science laboratory in Boston –, ""it's time to act."" In fact, women have already begun attacking the stronghold that is the high-tech world, a powerful business sector in the Quebec metropolis. MILA, Quebec's artificial intelligence institute, was set up there in 2017, headed by charismatic director Yoshua Bengio. The result is one of the largest concentrations of academic deep-learning researchers in the world.Some 30 technology giants, including Meta, Google, Ericsson and Microsoft, have also established their research centers in Montreal, and hundreds of start-ups have joined this ecosystem. By 2022, this high-tech sector, from video games to AI, accounted for nearly 263,000 jobs across Quebec, largely concentrated in the city of lights. Women held 22% of the positions.That's not a lot, yet it's better than in France, where 25% of students who choose a degree in the digital field are female but only 13% of them decide to make it their profession. It's also better than 20 years ago in Quebec, it should be noted.The Quebec government and the province's universities, along with the many associations involved in promoting women in this buoyant economic sector, are stepping up initiatives: on the one hand, to attract young women to these scientific fields – scholarships and computer coding courses are specifically aimed at them – and, on the other, to encourage companies to recruit them.Yet even those who have reached the most prestigious roles in this sector agree: certain clichés die hard. The image of the geek, with his hood up engrossed in coding in his basement before becoming Mark Zuckerberg (founder of Meta, formerly Facebook), Elon Musk (X, formerly Twitter) or Steve Jobs (Apple), promoted by the entire film industry since the early 2000s, is so deeply rooted in everyone's mind that it remains difficult for a woman to imagine herself in this world of men, to sneak in after them and then stay there.",Pixels,lets take power marie jos montpetit doctor electrical computer engineering invited participate discussion montreal march focusing role women fields science technology artificial intelligence promoted idea jobs innovation fascinating power change world hear sexagenarian quebec dazzling career behind years working prestigious massachusetts institute technology mit computer science laboratory boston time act fact women already begun attacking stronghold high tech world powerful business sector quebec metropolis mila quebecs artificial intelligence institute set headed charismatic director yoshua bengio result one largest concentrations academic deep learning researchers world technology giants including meta google ericsson microsoft also established research centers montreal hundreds start ups joined ecosystem high tech sector video games accounted nearly jobs across quebec largely concentrated city lights women held positions thats lot yet better france students choose degree digital field female decide make profession also better years ago quebec noted quebec government provinces universities along many associations involved promoting women buoyant economic sector stepping initiatives one hand attract young women scientific fields scholarships computer coding courses specifically aimed encourage companies recruit yet even reached prestigious roles sector agree certain clich die hard image geek hood engrossed coding basement becoming mark zuckerberg founder meta formerly facebook elon musk formerly twitter steve jobs apple promoted entire film industry since early deeply rooted everyones mind remains difficult woman imagine world men sneak stay,let take power mari jo montpetit doctor electr comput engin invit particip discuss montreal march focus role women field scienc technolog artifici intellig promot idea job innov fascin power chang world hear sexagenarian quebec dazzl career behind year work prestigi massachusett institut technolog mit comput scienc laboratori boston time act fact women alreadi begun attack stronghold high tech world power busi sector quebec metropoli mila quebec artifici intellig institut set head charismat director yoshua bengio result one largest concentr academ deep learn research world technolog giant includ meta googl ericsson microsoft also establish research center montreal hundr start up join ecosystem high tech sector video game account nearli job across quebec larg concentr citi light women held posit that lot yet better franc student choos degre digit field femal decid make profess also better year ago quebec note quebec govern provinc univers along mani associ involv promot women buoyant econom sector step initi one hand attract young women scientif field scholarship comput code cours specif aim encourag compani recruit yet even reach prestigi role sector agre certain clich die hard imag geek hood engross code basement becom mark zuckerberg founder meta formerli facebook elon musk formerli twitter steve job appl promot entir film industri sinc earli deepli root everyon mind remain difficult woman imagin world men sneak stay
"Elon Musk, the disinformed disinformer","    In just one year, the Tesla and SpaceX boss has transformed Twitter into X, a social media network where fake news proliferates. But he himself is a victim of this ecosystem, with his naiveté and gullibility shining through. ","It is possible to become the key master and then use those keys to lock yourself up in a narrow prison. This is the paradox of Elon Musk, who became owner and boss of Twitter (becoming X in July) on October 27, 2022, and a year later, seemed in every way to be a mental prisoner of the platform.Of course, when the capricious boss of Tesla Motors and SpaceX got his hands on the social media network with the blue bird, the former was not a rumor-proof genius, nor the latter a haven for measured discussion. Twitter was already known for its chaos, and the former world's richest man was known for his immoderate use of the platform – so much so that after being accused of manipulating Tesla's stock price through inconsistent posts, Musk pledged to the Wall Street watchdog in 2019, to stop tweeting about his company.But the marriage between the most politically scrutinized social media network and the most unpredictable billionaire soon gave birth to a festival of fanciful, tendentious and provocative allegations. No sooner had Twitter been bought out than the polarizing entrepreneur released a homophobic conspiracy theory, which he'd found on a far-right conspiracy site (something for which he later apologized). A few weeks later, as his brutal management sowed discord, he insinuated that a former Twitter employee, with whom he was in conflict, promoted the sexualization of children. He had already called a cave diver a pedophile after the man had the misfortune to criticize Musk's ideas in 2018. Conciliatory, American justice had seen this as mere invective.But for Musk, falsehood isn't just a way of managing his conflicts. It's a garment he sheds increasingly rarely. Without batting an eyelid, the internet entrepreneur shares everything from fake news articles, as from apocryphal quotes, without ever seeming to question their authenticity.In this respect, nothing is more unsettling than studying Musk's sometimes unfiltered reactions to vile assertions. A Trumpist influencer shared a manipulative video, attempting to make it appear against all evidence that the Capitol assailants on January 6, 2021, were escorted in by colluding police. The platform's boss jumped headlong into the trap and wrote ""it's crazy. The public has been misled.""Another far-right influencer – a certain Kanekoa the Great – pondered a graph about the evolution of flu, and pretended to wonder ""where it went in 2020 and 2021?""  Without the slightest critical distance, Musk then commented: ""Good question"" – as if it were not his responsibility to do his own research when picking up the conspiracy refrain. ""Strange,"" he again responded to another far-right account that had just shared a manipulative graphic about racist crime in the US.",Pixels,possible become key master use keys lock narrow prison paradox elon musk became owner boss twitter becoming july october year later seemed every way mental prisoner platform course capricious boss tesla motors spacex got hands social media network blue bird former rumor proof genius latter measured discussion twitter already known chaos former worlds richest man known immoderate use platform much accused manipulating teslas stock price inconsistent posts musk pledged wall street watchdog stop tweeting company marriage politically scrutinized social media network unpredictable billionaire soon gave birth festival fanciful tendentious provocative allegations sooner twitter bought polarizing entrepreneur released homophobic conspiracy theory hed found far right conspiracy site something later apologized weeks later brutal management sowed discord insinuated former twitter employee conflict promoted sexualization children already called cave diver pedophile man misfortune criticize musks ideas conciliatory american justice seen mere invective musk falsehood isnt way managing conflicts garment sheds increasingly rarely without batting eyelid internet entrepreneur shares everything fake news articles apocryphal quotes without ever seeming question authenticity respect nothing unsettling studying musks sometimes unfiltered reactions vile assertions trumpist influencer shared manipulative video attempting make appear evidence capitol assailants january escorted colluding police platforms boss jumped headlong trap wrote crazy public misled another far right influencer certain kanekoa great pondered graph evolution flu pretended wonder went without slightest critical distance musk commented good question responsibility research conspiracy refrain strange responded another far right account shared manipulative graphic racist crime,possibl becom key master use key lock narrow prison paradox elon musk becam owner boss twitter becom juli octob year later seem everi way mental prison platform cours caprici boss tesla motor spacex got hand social media network blue bird former rumor proof geniu latter measur discuss twitter alreadi known chao former world richest man known immoder use platform much accus manipul tesla stock price inconsist post musk pledg wall street watchdog stop tweet compani marriag polit scrutin social media network unpredict billionair soon gave birth festiv fanci tendenti provoc alleg sooner twitter bought polar entrepreneur releas homophob conspiraci theori hed found far right conspiraci site someth later apolog week later brutal manag sow discord insinu former twitter employe conflict promot sexual children alreadi call cave diver pedophil man misfortun critic musk idea conciliatori american justic seen mere invect musk falsehood isnt way manag conflict garment shed increasingli rare without bat eyelid internet entrepreneur share everyth fake news articl apocryph quot without ever seem question authent respect noth unsettl studi musk sometim unfilt reaction vile assert trumpist influenc share manipul video attempt make appear evid capitol assail januari escort collud polic platform boss jump headlong trap wrote crazi public misl anoth far right influenc certain kanekoa great ponder graph evolut flu pretend wonder went without slightest critic distanc musk comment good question respons research conspiraci refrain strang respond anoth far right account share manipul graphic racist crime
Crypto entrepreneur Bankman-Fried denies fraud in court,"    While the FTX founder acknowledged some of his failures early in his testimony in federal court on Friday, he has denied that he defrauded anyone and pled not guilty. ","FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried testified at his New York trial on Friday, denying that he defrauded anyone but acknowledging that the innovative business he had hoped would move the cryptocurrency ecosystem forward ended up hurting customers instead.The one-time cryptocurrency golden boy lost his businesses and his reputation as a pioneering entrepreneur in an emerging facet of finance when a rush of customers withdrew their money last year, exposing that billions of dollars were missing.Bankman-Fried, 31, acknowledged some of his failures early in his testimony in Manhattan federal court, saying he made mistakes, large and small. ""We thought we might be able to build the best product on the market"" and move the cryptocurrency system forward, he said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that,"" and a lot of customers and others got hurt, Bankman-Fried said.Asked by his lawyer, Mark Cohen, if he defrauded anyone or took customers' funds, Bankman-Fried answered, ""No I did not."" The California entrepreneur has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy charges accusing him of diverting billions of dollars from his clients and investors to make risky investments, buy luxury housing, engage in a star-studded publicity campaign, and make large political and charitable donations.His much-anticipated testimony became the centerpiece of a defense that has tried to convey that Bankman-Fried had no criminal intent as he took actions that prosecutors say were directly to blame for the collapse last November of businesses Bankman-Fried began creating in 2017 and eventually ran from the Bahamas.Before Bankman-Fried began testifying Friday, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan mostly shut down his lawyers' attempts to suggest to jurors that Bankman-Fried made many decisions about his businesses after consulting with lawyers.  After the jury was sent home Thursday, Bankman-Fried testified in front of the judge about his communications with lawyers as he built his cryptocurrency empire. ""That evidence would, in my judgment, be confusing and highly prejudicial by falsely implying, given testimony yesterday, that lawyers with full knowledge of the facts – all of the facts – blessed what the defendant is alleged to have done. And I didn’t hear that at all yesterday,"" Kaplan said.He did, though, grant a defense request to permit testimony about the involvement of lawyers in data retention policies at Bankman-Fried's businesses that required the frequent deletion of some communications.He was extradited from the Bahamas to New York in December to face fraud charges. Though he was initially granted a $250 million personal recognizance bond and allowed to live with his parents in Palo Alto, California, the bond was revoked in August and he was jailed when Kaplan concluded that he had tried to influence potential witnesses at his upcoming trial.Prosecutors built their case against Bankman-Fried for three weeks, relying largely on his former top executives, an inner circle of individuals who shared a penthouse apartment in the Bahamas with Bankman-Fried. The executives testified that Bankman-Fried directed them to spend billions of dollars taken from the accounts of FTX customers and funneled through Alameda Research, a hedge fund he started in 2017, two years before he created the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.",Pixels,ftx founder sam bankman fried testified new york trial friday denying defrauded anyone acknowledging innovative business hoped would move cryptocurrency ecosystem forward ended hurting customers instead one time cryptocurrency golden boy lost businesses reputation pioneering entrepreneur emerging facet finance rush customers withdrew money last year exposing billions dollars missing bankman fried acknowledged failures early testimony manhattan federal court saying made mistakes large small thought might able build best product market move cryptocurrency system forward said turned basically opposite lot customers others got hurt bankman fried said asked lawyer mark cohen defrauded anyone took customers funds bankman fried answered california entrepreneur pleaded guilty conspiracy charges accusing diverting billions dollars clients investors make risky investments buy luxury housing engage star studded publicity campaign make large political charitable donations much anticipated testimony became centerpiece defense tried convey bankman fried criminal intent took actions prosecutors say directly blame collapse last november businesses bankman fried began creating eventually ran bahamas bankman fried began testifying friday judge lewis kaplan mostly shut lawyers attempts suggest jurors bankman fried made many decisions businesses consulting lawyers jury sent home thursday bankman fried testified front judge communications lawyers built cryptocurrency empire evidence would judgment confusing highly prejudicial falsely implying given testimony yesterday lawyers full knowledge facts facts blessed defendant alleged done hear yesterday kaplan said though grant defense request permit testimony involvement lawyers data retention policies bankman frieds businesses required frequent deletion communications extradited bahamas new york december face fraud charges though initially granted million personal recognizance bond allowed live parents palo alto california bond revoked august jailed kaplan concluded tried influence potential witnesses upcoming trial prosecutors built case bankman fried three weeks relying largely former top executives inner circle individuals shared penthouse apartment bahamas bankman fried executives testified bankman fried directed spend billions dollars taken accounts ftx customers funneled alameda research hedge fund started two years created ftx cryptocurrency exchange,ftx founder sam bankman fri testifi new york trial friday deni defraud anyon acknowledg innov busi hope would move cryptocurr ecosystem forward end hurt custom instead one time cryptocurr golden boy lost busi reput pioneer entrepreneur emerg facet financ rush custom withdrew money last year expos billion dollar miss bankman fri acknowledg failur earli testimoni manhattan feder court say made mistak larg small thought might abl build best product market move cryptocurr system forward said turn basic opposit lot custom other got hurt bankman fri said ask lawyer mark cohen defraud anyon took custom fund bankman fri answer california entrepreneur plead guilti conspiraci charg accus divert billion dollar client investor make riski invest buy luxuri hous engag star stud public campaign make larg polit charit donat much anticip testimoni becam centerpiec defens tri convey bankman fri crimin intent took action prosecutor say directli blame collaps last novemb busi bankman fri began creat eventu ran bahama bankman fri began testifi friday judg lewi kaplan mostli shut lawyer attempt suggest juror bankman fri made mani decis busi consult lawyer juri sent home thursday bankman fri testifi front judg commun lawyer built cryptocurr empir evid would judgment confus highli prejudici fals impli given testimoni yesterday lawyer full knowledg fact fact bless defend alleg done hear yesterday kaplan said though grant defens request permit testimoni involv lawyer data retent polici bankman fri busi requir frequent delet commun extradit bahama new york decemb face fraud charg though initi grant million person recogniz bond allow live parent palo alto california bond revok august jail kaplan conclud tri influenc potenti wit upcom trial prosecutor built case bankman fri three week reli larg former top execut inner circl individu share penthous apart bahama bankman fri execut testifi bankman fri direct spend billion dollar taken account ftx custom funnel alameda research hedg fund start two year creat ftx cryptocurr exchang
Bluesky: What you need to know before signing up for Twitter's competitor,"    Still unknown just a few months ago, the platform – currently in its beta testing phase – is attracting more and more users tired of the lack of moderation on X (formerly Twitter). ","A doomed experiment or a credible alternative to X (formerly Twitter)? Since its launch in the spring, Bluesky has been attracting more and more users – at least those who manage to get themselves invited. What does this new social media platform look like? Who's behind it? How does it differ from Twitter or Mastodon? What does it intend to achieve? Le Monde tries to answer all your questions.Bluesky is virtually identical to the Twitter interface. You can post short messages, 300-character posts, and images, and subscribe to other users' accounts. Unsurprisingly, you can ""repost"" someone else's message to share it with your followers, or ""like"" it to show your support.The site had 100,000 users at the end of May, rising today to 1.6 million. Yet this sharp rise should be put into perspective: There are still 225 million active accounts on X – though this figure is falling – and Mastodon, a Twitter alternative that launched in 2016, lists 14 million accounts (1.7 million of which are active).Bluesky is still in its beta testing phase and is deliberately limiting the number of accounts through an invitation system. To join the platform, you have to sign up for a waiting list or obtain a code from one of the users already there. Every 10 days or so, they receive one of these golden tickets to distribute.There are, however, already a few large accounts, notably from media outlets such as the Washington Post, the New York Times, Bloomberg, and the American public radio station NPR. Le Monde is also on Bluesky, but it isn't posting anything there.The social media platform has seen waves of registrations, often correlated with announcements by the very polarizing owner of X, Elon Musk. They accelerated with the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, as violent images and videos of the conflict were being widely circulated on X – sometimes manipulated, rarely moderated.In previous months, Bluesky's early users were already praising its good-natured atmosphere, reminiscent of ""Twitter's golden days,"" according to the nostalgic ones. Others, however, have criticized it for this frivolity and a certain cliquishness. Bluesky is also said to be easier to use than Mastodon, a comparable platform in many respects, but with an interface less directly modeled on Twitter.For the time being, Bluesky includes the basic Twitter functionalities, but it's still missing many options that are generally considered basic. Animated GIFs and videos don't work at the moment, as the service's teams acknowledge that they don't yet have the means to moderate them. Nor is it possible to send private messages or create a poll.But even in its prototype state, Bluesky isn't just ""Twitter but worse."" While on X, the algorithm decides what content you'll see, according to rather nebulous criteria, Bluesky allows anyone to create and share their own algorithms – here called ""feeds.""It's possible to subscribe to different feeds and navigate from one to the next in the same way you would switch tabs in your web browser. Among the most popular are ""Top skeets FR,"" which shows the most popular French-language posts; ""Followers,"" which lets you see what your subscribers are posting; ""What's Science,"" which highlights scientific content; and ""Blacksky,"" which aims to amplify messages by the platform's Black users.Note that it is also possible to go without these feeds and simply follow the posts of your subscribers, with no algorithms or advertising.In 2019, Jack Dorsey, then CEO of Twitter, commissioned a team led by Parag Agrawal to devise a technology that would enable social media networks to operate in a decentralized way, connected yet autonomous. One of the theoretical interests of this technology dubbed the ""AT Protocol,"" was to enable more effective moderation, exercised at the level of each network rather than by a central authority. Accordingly, Bluesky is a simplified version of Twitter compatible with the AT Protocol – it will become its showcase.In 2021, when Agrawal replaced Dorsey at the head of Twitter, Bluesky took off and became an independent company. Today, its president is Jay Graber, although Dorsey retains a seat on the board. Bluesky remained funded by Twitter until the end of 2022 and Musk's takeover.Today, it's impossible for users of platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to interact directly with each other: Networks of this kind operate in a vacuum. The proponents of decentralized social media want to develop a protocol that would enable communication from one platform to another, in the same way, that you can have an ""@gmail.com"" mailbox and exchange with the owners of ""@outlook.com"" addresses in a transparent way.Bluesky is not the first to explore this avenue with its AT Protocol. A competing technology, ActivityPub, has enabled users of social media platforms Mastodon and Misskey and the video streaming platform PeerTube to communicate with each other for years. Such an approach has seduced even Facebook: Threads, its new social media platform still officially unavailable in Europe, is destined to join this decentralized galaxy. In the firmament of another galaxy, that of the AT Protocol, a single star shines for the time being: Bluesky. Nevertheless, the engineers behind the project have promised that by early 2024, AT will also be able to accommodate a whole host of applications.But what's the point of launching a new technology, rather than working in concert with the existing one? For the developers of Bluesky and AT, the answer is simple: They emphasize their desire to offer users unprecedented control over their data. The idea is that everyone will be the true owner of their data, and if they decide, for example, to leave Bluesky and join one of its future competitors, they'll be able to take it with them. The downside is that, for the time being, Bluesky offers very little protection for its users' data, and a great deal of normally hidden information is public.The troublesome Dorsey (he actively supports the conspiracy-theorist presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr) is not Bluesky's CEO, but he does sit on its board of directors. However, he deleted his Bluesky account in September and hasn't posted on Twitter since then.Instead, he makes daily use of Nostr, a decentralized social media technology that competes with the ActivityPub and AT protocols and openly relies on the blockchain. Some have seen one of his public pronouncements – ""The only solution is to build on unowned protocols like Nostr and bitcoin"" – as an implicit disavowal of Bluesky. The latter's developers have promised that, while the AT Protocol will be compatible with the blockchain and their competitors will be able to take advantage of it if they wish, Bluesky will not use it.That's the big question. For the moment, no business model is emerging. The only thing you can pay for is a personalized, forgery-proof domain name. While usernames on Bluesky are built on the ""@XXX.bsky.social"" model, it is possible to use a perhaps more elegant domain name, which has the added advantage of proving that you are the person, media, or service you claim to be.For example, the username for Le Monde on Bluesky is not @lemonde.bsky.social, but @lemonde.fr, indicating that the account administrators are the same as the owners of the domain name www.lemonde.fr.Bluesky can be accessed via the official app available on iOS or Android, or on the Bsky.app website. Other alternative tools exist, such as Deck.blue, which reproduces the experience of Twitter's TweetDeck, and the Graysky app, which already lets you post animated GIFs.

The UK hosts the first global summit on the risks associated with artificial intelligence,    Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wants to propose the creation of a group of international experts tasked with publishing a report on the state of AI. ,"The British media have dubbed it the ""doom summit."" On Wednesday and Thursday, November 1 and 2, at Bletchley Park north of London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government will hold the first global conference devoted to the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). On this former base for British intelligence services – where mathematician Alan Turing managed to decipher the German encryption machine Enigma during World War II – around a hundred executives, business leaders and experts will discuss the existential risks posed by ""Frontier AI"": the most advanced generative AI models, capable of creating extremely elaborate content (video, images, sound, text) in record time.Ahead of the summit, Downing Street, which has surrounded itself with experts of undisputed renown to prepare for this meeting (such as Yoshua Bengio, professor of computer science at the University of Montreal), published its own particularly gloomy conclusions on the risks associated with ""Frontier AI."" From 2030 onward, future generations of these models could help terrorist groups foment chemical attacks, enable cyberattacks of unprecedented scale and effectiveness, manipulate public opinion on a massive scale, and increase unemployment and poverty. They could even escape human control.""I don't want to be alarmist [...] some experts think it will never happen at all. But [...] if they did manifest themselves, the consequences would be incredibly serious. [...] We could look the other way, but we think it's better to face up to this reality, because it's the best thing to do to protect the British people,"" explained Sunak on Thursday, October 26, from the site of the Royal Society of London, one of the world's oldest learned societies. For the 43-year-old leader, who did part of his studies at Stanford University in California and maintains a good network in Silicon Valley, claiming to be ""pro-technology,"" it's not just a matter of scaremongering in an already anxiety-inducing climate.With this summit, which he has instigated and devoted much energy to, the Conservative leader hopes to put the UK firmly on the map with regard to the field of artificial intelligence, as generative models advance at breakneck speed with obvious economic and geopolitical implications. The two giants of AI are China and the US – the latter home to the sector's leading companies (Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Amazon) – but Sunak stressed on Thursday that the UK is ""the best place in Europe to raise capital, all of the leading AI companies choosing the UK as their European headquarters.

French telecom group Altice is on a precipice,"Patrick Drahi may be playing down Altice's colossal debt, but inflation and rising interest rates are forcing him to take on more debt. The company is teetering on the brink. His business partner's arrest in July, SFR's stagnation and this financial risk may push it over the edge.","""Debt is a zero issue."" On October 17, speaking to staff representatives at Altice France (the parent company of telecoms company SFR and the TV channel BFM-TV) for the first time since the July 13 arrest of his long-time partner Armando Pereira for alleged corruption, Drahi played things down: The company's €24 billion debt would not keep him up at night.Aged 60, the businessman has learned to juggle with bank loans since he went into business in the mid-1990s. He has felt the vertigo of imminent collapse up close. In 2007, for instance, his then-company Numericable was crumbling under €3 billion in debt on just €1 billion in sales. But Drahi never foundered. Each time, he found the financial acrobatics that enabled him to return to equilibrium.In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, in order to stimulate the economy, the major central banks constantly lowered interest rates, even to the point of going negative in the eurozone. And since that was not sufficient, they even went so far as to buy government and corporate debt to ease their burden. It was as if a household purchasing an apartment saw the European Central Bank buy back part of its mortgage.Drahi took advantage of this comfort to do business according to the classic leveraged buy-out (LBO) model developed by investment funds: buying a company on maximum credit and using its profits to pay the interest on debt. It was thanks to cheap money that the businessman managed to buy SFR from Vivendi in 2014 for €13.5 billion, 100% on credit.It was a bold stunt for which the operator is now paying the price. The environment has changed. With the return of inflation, central banks have raised rates to slow economic activity and bring down overheated prices. As a result, money is becoming increasingly expensive. Drahi has realized as much. Even Altice International, his empire's healthiest subsidiary, borrowed €800 million on the financial markets in early October, at a rate of 10.5%, to replace a soon-to-expire line of credit from a loan contracted in July 2020, at a rate of just 2.25%. Altice is paying four times more for its debt than it was three years ago.To reassure, Drahi repeats that Altice France has no repayments scheduled in the short term.

Disney to complete takeover of Hulu with $8.6 billion deal,"    The deal values Hulu at $27.5 billion in total, according to Disney, which said the transaction will be concluded by December 1. ","The Walt Disney Company on Wednesday, November 1, announced it will buy Comcast's $8.6 billion stake in Hulu, completing its takeover of the streaming service. The acquisition will ""further Disney's streaming objectives,"" the company said in a press release and comes as it strives to boost subscriber numbers at its Disney+ streaming service.The deal values Hulu at $27.5 billion in total, according to Disney, which said the transaction will be concluded by December 1. The California-based entertainment giant already sells Hulu as part of bundled offerings with its Disney+ and ESPN+ platforms. An ad-subsidized bundle of the three services is priced at $15 monthly in the United States, with an ad-free version costing $25 per month.The company will release its latest quarterly earnings next week, providing a look at how its cable and streaming services are doing in the fiercely competitive market. Disney in August reported that Disney+ lost more than 10 million subscribers in the recently ended quarter, in large part in the Indian market. Disney+ finished the second three months of this year with 146.1 million subscribers, compared with just shy of 158 million in the prior quarter, the group said.Disney rival Netflix last month said subscriber numbers grew nearly 11% to 247 million as it cracked down on password sharing and refined an ad-supported tier. The leading streaming service increased prices on some of its plans, perhaps creating an opportunity for competitors such as Disney. Netflix said in an earnings report that its nascent ad-supported offering was gaining traction, and the coming Disney earnings should provide insight into whether the same is true for its ad-supported tier.Meanwhile, film and television makers see productions halted by an actors strike in the United States, meaning a potential lack of fresh content needed to attract and keep streaming subscribers.Hulu was founded in 2007 as a joint venture between News Corporation and NBC Universal, with Disney joining soon after as a partner, according to its website. Disney chief executive Bob Iger said during an earnings call in August that he was confident in the company's long-term trajectory ""despite near-term headwinds."" Iger told financial analysts that streaming, film studios and theme parks will drive its growth in the coming five years.All but a sliver of the loss in Disney+ subscribers took place in India, where the entertainment titan early this year lost rights to stream popular Premier League cricket matches. Disney will release details of upcoming streaming price increases late Wednesday and will make an ad-supported Disney+ tier available in Canada and parts of Europe, according to Iger.",Pixels,walt disney company wednesday november announced buy comcasts billion stake hulu completing takeover streaming service acquisition disneys streaming objectives company said press release comes strives boost subscriber numbers disney streaming service deal values hulu billion total according disney said transaction concluded december california based entertainment giant already sells hulu part bundled offerings disney espn platforms subsidized bundle three services priced monthly united states free version costing per month company release latest quarterly earnings next week providing look cable streaming services fiercely competitive market disney august reported disney lost million subscribers recently ended quarter large part indian market disney finished second three months year million subscribers compared shy million prior quarter group said disney rival netflix last month said subscriber numbers grew nearly million cracked password sharing refined supported tier leading streaming service increased prices plans perhaps creating opportunity competitors disney netflix said earnings report nascent supported offering gaining traction coming disney earnings provide insight whether true supported tier meanwhile film television makers see productions halted actors strike united states meaning potential lack fresh content needed attract keep streaming subscribers hulu founded joint venture news corporation nbc universal disney joining soon partner according website disney chief executive bob iger said earnings call august confident companys long term trajectory despite near term headwinds iger told financial analysts streaming film studios theme parks drive growth coming five years sliver loss disney subscribers took place india entertainment titan early year lost rights stream popular premier league cricket matches disney release details upcoming streaming price increases late wednesday make supported disney tier available canada parts europe according iger,walt disney compani wednesday novemb announc buy comcast billion stake hulu complet takeov stream servic acquisit disney stream object compani said press releas come strive boost subscrib number disney stream servic deal valu hulu billion total accord disney said transact conclud decemb california base entertain giant alreadi sell hulu part bundl offer disney espn platform subsid bundl three servic price monthli unit state free version cost per month compani releas latest quarterli earn next week provid look cabl stream servic fierc competit market disney august report disney lost million subscrib recent end quarter larg part indian market disney finish second three month year million subscrib compar shi million prior quarter group said disney rival netflix last month said subscrib number grew nearli million crack password share refin support tier lead stream servic increas price plan perhap creat opportun competitor disney netflix said earn report nascent support offer gain traction come disney earn provid insight whether true support tier meanwhil film televis maker see product halt actor strike unit state mean potenti lack fresh content need attract keep stream subscrib hulu found joint ventur news corpor nbc univers disney join soon partner accord websit disney chief execut bob iger said earn call august confid compani long term trajectori despit near term headwind iger told financi analyst stream film studio theme park drive growth come five year sliver loss disney subscrib took place india entertain titan earli year lost right stream popular premier leagu cricket match disney releas detail upcom stream price increas late wednesday make support disney tier avail canada part europ accord iger
Crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty on all counts at FTX fraud trial,    The spectacular rise and fall of the FTX founder hit rock bottom Thursday when a New York jury convicted him of fraud in a scheme that cheated customers and investors of at least $10 billion. The 30-year-old now faces up to 110 years in prison. ,"Sam Bankman-Fried, the one-time cryptocurrency golden boy accused by US prosecutors of stealing billions of dollars of his customers' money, was found guilty on Thursday, November 2, on all counts and now faces up to 110 years behind bars. Following five weeks of trial in New York, the jury reached its decision in just five hours. Sentencing for a man widely known as ""SBF"" will take place at a later date.US Attorney Damian Williams, in a statement after the verdict was announced, said Bankman-Fried had ""perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history, a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the king of crypto."" ""The cryptocurrency industry might be new, players like SBF might be new, but this kind of fraud, this kind of corruption is as old as time and we have no patience for it."" Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried's lawyer, said they were ""very disappointed with the result."" ""Mr. Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and will continue to vigorously fight the charges against him,"" he added.A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a billionaire before the age of 30, Bankman-Fried conquered the crypto world at breakneck speed, turning FTX, a small start-up he co-founded in 2019, into the world's second-largest exchange platform. But in November 2022, the FTX empire imploded, unable to cope with massive withdrawal requests from customers panicked to learn that some of the funds stored at the company had been committed to risky operations at Bankman Fried's personal hedge fund, Alameda Research.During the weeks-long trial, some of his closest associates testified that he was key to all the decisions that saw $8 billion vanish from his FTX trading platform. In closing arguments, prosecutors portrayed the defendant as an extremely smart man consumed by greed who knew what he was doing when FTX funds were secretly funneled to Alameda. The defense said their client had acted in ""good faith"" and was overtaken by circumstances and the financial ineptitude of close associates who testified against him to gain leniency from prosecutors.The star witness in the trial was Caroline Ellison, the former Alameda CEO and Bankman-Fried's on-and-off-again girlfriend. She told the jury that they had stolen ""around $14 billion"" from FTX clients and that Bankman-Fried, as owner of Alameda, ""directed me to commit those crimes."" That money was used to finance venture capital deals, political contributions and swanky real estate in the Bahamas. It also went toward paying tens of millions of dollars to celebrities, including Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen, to gain their endorsement of FTX, as well as buying the naming rights for the Miami Heat's home arena. According to prosecutors, at the time of FTX's collapse, just over $8 billion belonging to customers had vanished into bad investments at Alameda.During his trial, Bankman-Fried admitted he had made ""mistakes"" but denied that he had ever tried to defraud anyone. Prosecutor Nicholas Roos told the jury it had to decide whether ""the defendant knew taking the money was wrong."" ""He knew it was wrong. He did it anyway (and) thought because he was smart he could get away with it,"" the prosecutor argued. Roos pointed out that three witnesses, Ellison and other close associates, each claimed that the ex-cryptocurrency genius had given instructions for Alameda to pilfer the coffers of FTX, virtually without limit.The crypto world was shaken by the rapid collapse of FTX and is just beginning to recover. Underlining the high level of interest in the case, US Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a statement after the verdict thanking prosecutors and the FBI for their ""outstanding work in bringing Mr Bankman-Fried to justice."" ""This case should send a clear message to anyone who tries to hide their crimes behind a shiny new thing they claim no one else is smart enough to understand: the Justice Department will hold you accountable,"" he said.",Pixels,sam bankman fried one time cryptocurrency golden boy accused prosecutors stealing billions dollars customers money found guilty thursday november counts faces years

FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty of fraud,    The federal prosecutor declared that the case was a 'a warning to every fraudster who thinks they're untouchable.' The cryptocurrency platform's former CEO faces up to 110 years in prison. ,"The verdict came in less than five hours: guilty. Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the FTX cryptocurrency empire, which went bankrupt in November 2022, was found guilty on seven counts by a New York jury on Thursday, November 2, including fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. The 31-year-old former financial whiz, known for his black hair and Bermuda shorts, faces up to 110 years in prison. The sentence will be handed down later, on March 28, 2024, by federal judge Lewis Kaplan, in line with standard US practice.The trial, which opened in early October, went very badly for the entrepreneur, founder of a cryptocurrency exchange platform FTX, which was still valued at $26 billion (€24.5 billion) less than two years ago. First, Bankman-Fried appeared from prison, his bail having been revoked by the court this summer for his attempt to influence Caroline Ellison, his former girlfriend. She was the head of Alameda, the FTX subsidiary that orchestrated all the fraudulent speculation with FTX clients' funds from the Bahamas.The prosecutor got a guilty plea from Ellison, who testified against Bankman-Fried, and explained how she lived in terror during the months of fraud before the edifice collapsed. The lying and stealing had, in her words, left her in ""a constant state of dread."" Two other employees, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, also pleaded guilty and testified against their former boss. A childhood friend of Bankman-Fried and former FTX engineering director, Singh testified that he learned in September 2022 that Alameda had used $13 billion of FTX customer funds and was unable to repay them.Finally, Bankman-Fried took the risk of testifying at his own trial, which is not mandatory – defendants have the right to remain silent – and is even highly unusual. ""Bankman-Fried made the risky decision of testifying, and it does not appear to have helped him at all,"" wrote the New York Times on Thursday evening. Indeed, the defendant lost points when the prosecutor confronted him with the statements he was making in his heyday and the fraud orchestrated during that time. Refusing to admit blame or acknowledge his misdeeds, Bankman-Fried answered ""I don't remember"" more than 140 times to the prosecutor who was questioning him, according to a count by the New York Times. He said he had never cheated any customers but regretted not having implemented better risk management at FTX. ""We sure should have,"" he said.His lawyers tried to explain that their client was not the evil swindler described by legend, but a math nerd, overwhelmed by the new industry and the business he had been trying to create since 2019 in a new and chaotic universe. ""In the real world, unlike the movie world, things can get messy,"" his lawyer Mark Cohen assured the jury.",Pixels,verdict came less five hours guilty sam bankman fried founder ftx cryptocurrency empire went bankrupt november found guilty seven counts new york jury thursday november including fraud conspiracy money laundering year old former financial whiz known black hair bermuda shorts faces years prison sentence handed later march federal judge lewis kaplan line standard practice trial opened early october went badly entrepreneur founder cryptocurrency exchange platform ftx still valued billion billion less two years ago first bankman fried appeared prison bail revoked court summer attempt influence caroline ellison former girlfriend head alameda ftx subsidiary orchestrated fraudulent speculation ftx clients funds bahamas prosecutor got guilty plea ellison testified bankman fried explained lived terror months fraud edifice collapsed lying stealing words left constant state dread two employees gary wang nishad singh also pleaded guilty testified former boss childhood friend bankman fried former ftx engineering director singh testified learned september alameda used billion ftx customer funds unable repay finally bankman fried took risk testifying trial mandatory defendants right remain silent even highly unusual bankman fried made risky decision testifying appear helped wrote new york times thursday evening indeed defendant lost points prosecutor confronted statements making heyday fraud orchestrated time refusing admit blame acknowledge misdeeds bankman fried answered dont remember times prosecutor questioning according count new york times said never cheated customers regretted implemented better risk management ftx sure said lawyers tried explain client evil swindler described legend math nerd overwhelmed new industry business trying create since new chaotic universe real world unlike movie world things get messy lawyer mark cohen assured jury,verdict came less five hour guilti sam bankman fri founder ftx cryptocurr empir went bankrupt novemb found guilti seven count new york juri thursday novemb includ fraud conspiraci money launder year old former financi whiz known black hair bermuda short face year prison sentenc hand later march feder judg lewi kaplan line standard practic trial open earli octob went badli entrepreneur founder cryptocurr exchang platform ftx still valu billion billion less two year ago first bankman fri appear prison bail revok court summer attempt influenc carolin ellison former girlfriend head alameda ftx subsidiari orchestr fraudul specul ftx client fund bahama prosecutor got guilti plea ellison testifi bankman fri explain live terror month fraud edific collaps lie steal word left constant state dread two employe gari wang nishad singh also plead guilti testifi former boss childhood friend bankman fri former ftx engin director singh testifi learn septemb alameda use billion ftx custom fund unabl repay final bankman fri took risk testifi trial mandatori defend right remain silent even highli unusu bankman fri made riski decis testifi appear help wrote new york time thursday even inde defend lost point prosecutor confront statement make heyday fraud orchestr time refus admit blame acknowledg misde bankman fri answer dont rememb time prosecutor question accord count new york time said never cheat custom regret implement better risk manag ftx sure said lawyer tri explain client evil swindler describ legend math nerd overwhelm new industri busi tri creat sinc new chaotic univers real world unlik movi world thing get messi lawyer mark cohen assur juri
Macron backs French Youtuber's video game museum project,"    In a video published on Sunday, the French president said he was giving his support to the Tev project, from the Twitch channel IciJaponCorp. The online crowdfunding campaign has already raised over €1.7 million. ","""I simply wanted to give you my support and high endorsement for your video game museum project, an active museum, a living city,"" declared Emmanuel Macron in a video broadcast on the Twitch channel IciJaponCorp on Sunday, November 5. On the same day, the crowdfunding campaign was due to close for the Odyssée project, an initiative launched by the channel's host, video artist and entrepreneur Benoît Theveny (known by his pseudonym Tev) to create a video game museum in the town of Bussy-Saint-Georges, in the Paris region. At the time of the French president's speech, the fund, launched on September 20, had exceeded €1.7 million.This message to the channel's audience was aimed more broadly at the gaming community and industry professionals. In his video, Macron began by congratulating viewers of the IciJaponCorp channel for their ""mobilization,"" then went on to thank visitors to Paris Games Week (PGW), France's biggest video game trade show, which ran until Sunday in the capital. The two events were not linked, however, as PGW is organized by the industry's main representative of commercial interests, the Syndicat des Editeurs de Logiciel de Loisir.In his message, the president also paid tribute to French professionals in the sector, which represents ""thousands of jobs, 600 studios in our country, and remarkable schools."" The press release also put forward the e-sport sector, highlighting the recent reduction in VAT to 5.5% on competitive video game events. The measure was in the finance bill for 2024.The idea for a private video game museum has been championed for a number of months by Tev, a Youtuber who also runs a company based in Japan and France, specializing in e-commerce, tourism and communications. Back in February, he was keen to find a place to display the collection of video game-related objects belonging to another French entrepreneur, Ludovic Charles. Speaking to Le Monde, Charles said he owned more than 2,000 consoles and tens of thousands of game boxes and vintage computers, all of which could be added to the museum's collections.The two men accepted a proposal from the mayor of Bussy-Saint-Georges, a town some 30 kilometers east of Paris, to install their private museum within a real estate project dedicated to sports and entertainment activities. The initiators of the Odyssée project hope to create ""the largest video game museum in the world.""According to the local councilor in charge of the project who spoke with Le Monde, the plans for the building have yet to be defined and the building permit should be submitted in early 2024. Built by a real-estate developer, the museum will have its rent financed by revenues from a commercial space themed on Japanese culture, located on the same site, explained Charles. The money collected from internet users should only be used to pay for the decor of the exhibition space, he added.While there is currently no museum specializing in video games in France, a number of similar projects have been attempted but have failed to come to fruition or to survive. For example, the video game museum in Schiltigheim (in the eastern French region of Alsace) had to close its doors in 2020 and relocate to Belgium. Institutions, including the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (CNAM, National Conservatory of Arts ad Crafts) and the Institut National de Recherche en Sciences et Technologies du Numérique (INRIA, National Institute for Research in Science and Digital Technologies), as well as organizations, such as the Paris-based Mo5, are campaigning for a national public museum for computing and video games.The high patronage label granted to the Odyssée project by Macron is purely honorary and does not entail any material support. It does, however, lend credibility and media visibility to the project and reflects ""a mark of interest from the head of state,"" according to the Elysée. It can also help in the search for financing: ""We'll be there to make things easier for you, to support you, to see this project through to the end,"" said Macron in his message.With his endorsement, the French president was making a new commitment to the video game industry. In a message published on X on September 16, he admitted that he had made the gamers see red: He was talking about his statement from June 30, during the urban riots that followed the death of Nahel M, who was killed by a police officer during a traffic stop. At that time, he lamented that ""certain young people"" had become ""intoxicated"" by video games.",Pixels,simply wanted give support high endorsement video game museum project active museum living

ChatGPT maker OpenAI announces customizable chatbots and enhanced AI models,    The San Francisco-based start-up presented its latest innovations on Monday while promising 'superpowers on demand' for all. ,"ChatGPT maker OpenAI on Monday, November 6, enticed developers with lower prices and the ability to easily tailor artificial intelligence ""agents"" to help with anything from laundry advice to contract negotiations. Dreams of the benefits of generative AI along with fears of the technology's risks have been hot topics in the tech world since ChatGPT made its blockbuster debut a year ago.""We will be able to do more; to create more, and to have more,"" Open AI chief executive Sam Altman told developers at the gathering in San Francisco. ""As intelligence is integrated everywhere, we will all have superpowers on demand."" More than two million developers are building on the OpenAI platform, while more than 100 million people use ChatGPT weekly, according to the San Francisco-based startup. ""About a year ago, November 30, we shipped ChatGPT as a low-key research preview,"" Altman said. ""That went pretty well,"" he quipped. The launch of ChatGPT ignited an AI race with contenders including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta.Altman has testified before US Congress about AI and spoken with heads of state about the technology. Pressure has ramped steadily to regulate AI to control for risks such as its use in bioweapons, misinformation and other threats. President Joe Biden issued an executive order just weeks ago on regulating artificial intelligence, aiming for the United States to ""lead the way"" in global efforts at managing the new technology's risks. The order directs federal agencies to set new safety standards for AI systems and requires developers to ""share their safety test results and other critical information with the US government,"" according to a White House statement. The world's first major summit on artificial AI safety took place last week in the UK with political and tech leaders discussing possible responses to the society-changing technology.Altman announced a ""Turbo"" version of OpenAI's leading software along with reduced pricing in moves that could fuel the spread of the technology. ""It's a smarter model,"" Altman said of ChatGPT Turbo. ""We decided to prioritize price first, but we're going to work on speed next."" OpenAI is rolling out the ability to create custom ""agents"" called ""GPTs"" capable of handling specific tasks, such as business negotiation advice, tips on removing stains from laundry, help with homework and tech support, it said in a blog post. ""Anyone can easily build their own GPT - no coding is required,"" OpenAI said. ""You can make them for yourself, just for your company's internal use, or for everyone.""Later this month, OpenAI will launch a GPT Store and plans to add a way for developers to make money based on how many people use their GPTs, according to the company.

Co-working giant WeWork files for bankruptcy,"    Once valued at $49 billion, WeWork has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a stunning fall for the office-sharing company once seen as a Wall Street darling that promised to change the way people went to work around the world. ","Beleaguered shared office giant WeWork, which has been in dire financial straits for years, announced on Monday, November 6, that it had filed for bankruptcy in a bid to negotiate down its debt. The coworking company said its bankruptcy impacts operations in the United States and Canada, but ""global operations are expected to continue as usual.""The bankruptcy filing was a stark turn of events for the New York-based company, which was once a startup darling promising to reshape the office sector globally. It at one point attracted huge infusions from investors, including SoftBank and venture capital firm Benchmark. WeWork was considered the most valuable US startup as recently as 2019, worth $49 billion.But elusive profitability, the rise of telecommuting, a drop in tenants and years of massive costs have hit the company hard. In early August, WeWork warned the US stock market regulator (SEC) that it feared for its survival: ""Substantial doubt exists about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.""Nonetheless, the company put a positive spin on the bankruptcy news. ""Now is the time for us to pull the future forward by aggressively addressing our legacy leases and dramatically improving our balance sheet,"" WeWork chief executive David Tolley said in a statement. ""We defined a new category of working, and these steps will enable us to remain the global leader in flexible work.""In practical terms, Chapter 11 proceedings enable a company to renegotiate its debt with creditors and present a plan to reorganize its business, while remaining under the protection of the law for a period that can extend over several years.WeWork hopes to negotiate a ""significant"" reduction in its debt. In particular, the group hopes to ""terminate the leases on a number of locations"" that are not making enough money, pointing out that the owner companies ""have received advance notice."" Ratings agency S&P said on November 1 that WeWork was in ""selective default"" after failing to meet conditions set by debt holders.WeWork had been a celebrated star in the sharing economy, laying down a mammoth footprint in the commercial real estate sectors of major cities around the globe. But investors tired of its messianic then-chief executive Adam Neumann, massive operating costs and lack of profits in 2019, when it tried to go public.The flamboyant Neumann, who started WeWork in 2010, was axed after the initial public offering failed. WeWork's slide only accelerated during the Coronavirus pandemic, which led to office closures and the rise of work from home.The company has scrambled to sell off part of its business, renegotiate leases and shut branches, but it still lost more than $1 billion in the first half of 2023.WeWork's downfall also severely destabilized the Japanese SoftBank Group and its Vision Fund, which had invested heavily in the company, thereby denting the visionary image of its CEO, Masayoshi Son.WeWork eventually did go public in 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company. WeWork's shares were worth just 80 cents at the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday evening, for a market capitalization of $44.5 million.",Pixels,beleaguered shared office giant wework dire financial straits years announced monday november filed bankruptcy bid negotiate debt coworking company said bankruptcy impacts operations united states canada global operations expected continue usual bankruptcy filing stark turn events new york based company startup darling promising reshape office sector globally one point attracted huge infusions investors including softbank venture capital firm benchmark wework considered valuable startup recently worth billion elusive profitability rise telecommuting drop tenants years massive costs hit company hard early august wework warned stock market regulator sec feared survival substantial doubt exists companys ability continue going concern nonetheless company put positive spin bankruptcy news time pull future forward aggressively addressing legacy leases dramatically improving balance sheet wework chief executive david tolley said statement defined new category working steps enable remain global leader flexible work practical terms chapter proceedings enable company renegotiate debt creditors present plan reorganize business remaining protection law period extend several years wework hopes negotiate significant reduction debt particular group hopes terminate leases number locations making enough money pointing owner companies received advance notice ratings agency said november wework selective default failing meet conditions set debt holders wework celebrated star sharing economy laying mammoth footprint commercial real estate sectors major cities around globe investors tired messianic chief executive adam neumann massive operating costs lack profits tried public flamboyant neumann started wework axed initial public offering failed weworks slide accelerated coronavirus pandemic led office closures rise work home company scrambled sell part business renegotiate leases shut branches still lost billion first half weworks downfall also severely destabilized japanese softbank group vision fund invested heavily company thereby denting visionary image ceo masayoshi son wework eventually public special purpose acquisition company weworks shares worth cents close trading new york stock exchange monday evening market capitalization million,beleagu share offic giant wework dire financi strait year announc monday novemb file bankruptci bid negoti debt cowork compani said bankruptci impact oper unit state canada global oper expect continu usual bankruptci file stark turn event new york base compani startup darl promis reshap offic sector global one point attract huge infus investor includ softbank ventur capit firm benchmark wework consid valuabl startup recent worth billion elus profit rise telecommut drop tenant year massiv cost hit compani hard earli august wework warn stock market regul sec fear surviv substanti doubt exist compani abil continu go concern nonetheless compani put posit spin bankruptci news time pull futur forward aggress address legaci leas dramat improv balanc sheet wework chief execut david tolley said statement defin new categori work step enabl remain global leader flexibl work practic term chapter proceed enabl compani renegoti debt creditor present plan reorgan busi remain protect law period extend sever year wework hope negoti signific reduct debt particular group hope termin leas number locat make enough money point owner compani receiv advanc notic rate agenc said novemb wework select default fail meet condit set debt holder wework celebr star share economi lay mammoth footprint commerci real estat sector major citi around globe investor tire messian chief execut adam neumann massiv oper cost lack profit tri public flamboy neumann start wework axe initi public offer fail wework slide acceler coronaviru pandem led offic closur rise work home compani scrambl sell part busi renegoti leas shut branch still lost billion first half wework downfal also sever destabil japanes softbank group vision fund invest heavili compani therebi dent visionari imag ceo masayoshi son wework eventu public special purpos acquisit compani wework share worth cent close trade new york stock exchang monday even market capit million
Stars of David graffiti in Paris: Russian interference suspected,    French intelligence services believe the act was commissioned by the Moldovan businessman Anatolii Prizenko. Images were widely shared by the 'Doppelgänger' pro-Russian propaganda network. ,"Four Moldovan nationals are strongly suspected of being behind some of the 250 Star of David tags found on walls in Paris and its suburbs over the past 10 days. One couple was arrested on October 27, another is on the run. French intelligence agencies now firmly believe it was an external attempt at destabilization. In a press release issued on Tuesday, November 7, the Paris prosecutor said that the examination of telephone data ""suggests that the two pairs of perpetrators were in touch with the same third person."" The prosecutor also stated that ""at this stage, it cannot be ruled out that the marking of the blue Stars of David in the Paris region was carried out at the express request of a person living abroad."" The investigation has now been handed to an investigating magistrate.Le Monde's analysis, confirmed by two independent experts, finds that the operation was exploited by the ""Doppelgänger"" network, also known as RRN (for Reliable Recent News). On October 28, a large number of accounts affiliated with this network started sharing on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook two photos of the blue tags on the walls of a building on Rue de Rocroy, in Paris's 10th arrondissement. The vandalism from that night led to the arrest of a couple of Moldovan nationals, aged 28 and 33.The RRN propaganda infrastructure – which, in addition to bots publishing large quantities of messages on social media, also runs fake news sites in French and has previously created fake copies of major news websites (including Le Monde) – had been publicly denounced by the French government on June 13. In a rare statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry had attributed the disinformation operation to Russia, seeing it as ""a new illustration of the hybrid strategy that Russia is implementing to undermine the conditions for a peaceful democratic debate and thus undermine our democratic institutions.""The photos of Star of David tags posted by accounts linked to the ""Doppelgänger"" network don't appear to have been published by anyone else. They were not published by any news media and Le Monde has not been able to find any other source for them on social media. In the meantime, the Moldovan couple was arrested. Preliminary findings from investigators suggest that, following the principle of compartmentalization of any clandestine action, a third party was tasked with capturing photographs of the tags. These images were then sent to the operation's sponsor as evidence of mission completion, enabling them to share them online.",Pixels,four moldovan nationals strongly suspected behind star david tags found walls paris suburbs past days one couple arrested october another run french intelligence agencies firmly believe external attempt destabilization press release issued tuesday november paris prosecutor said examination telephone data suggests two pairs perpetrators touch third person prosecutor also stated stage ruled marking blue stars david paris region carried express request person living abroad investigation handed investigating magistrate mondes analysis confirmed two independent experts finds operation exploited doppelg nger network also known rrn reliable recent news october large number accounts affiliated network started sharing formerly twitter facebook two photos blue tags walls building rue rocroy pariss arrondissement vandalism night led arrest couple moldovan nationals aged rrn propaganda infrastructure addition bots publishing large quantities messages social media also runs fake news sites french previously created fake copies major news websites including monde publicly denounced french government june rare statement foreign affairs ministry attributed disinformation operation russia seeing new illustration hybrid strategy russia implementing undermine conditions peaceful democratic debate thus undermine democratic institutions photos star david tags posted accounts linked doppelg nger network dont appear published anyone else published news media monde able find source social media meantime moldovan couple arrested preliminary findings investigators suggest following principle compartmentalization clandestine action third party tasked capturing photographs tags images sent operations sponsor evidence mission completion enabling share online,four moldovan nation strongli suspect behind star david tag found wall pari suburb past day one coupl arrest octob anoth run french intellig agenc firmli believ extern attempt destabil press releas issu tuesday novemb pari prosecutor said examin telephon data suggest two pair perpetr touch third person prosecutor also state stage rule mark blue star david pari region carri express request person live abroad investig hand investig magistr mond analysi confirm two independ expert find oper exploit doppelg nger network also known rrn reliabl recent news octob larg number account affili network start share formerli twitter facebook two photo blue tag wall build rue rocroy pariss arrondiss vandal night led arrest coupl moldovan nation age rrn propaganda infrastructur addit bot publish larg quantiti messag social media also run fake news site french previous creat fake copi major news websit includ mond publicli denounc french govern june rare statement foreign affair ministri attribut disinform oper russia see new illustr hybrid strategi russia implement undermin condit peac democrat debat thu undermin democrat institut photo star david tag post account link doppelg nger network dont appear publish anyon els publish news media mond abl find sourc social media meantim moldovan coupl arrest preliminari find investig suggest follow principl compartment clandestin action third parti task captur photograph tag imag sent oper sponsor evid mission complet enabl share onlin
Quantum computers: French start-up Quandela raises €50 million,"    This funding, which comes less than a year after the $100 million raised by its competitor Pasqal, illustrates the advances made by this technology. ","The promise of quantum computing is increasingly reflected in the figures. Quandela, one of the French start-ups involved in the manufacture of these new-generation supercomputers, announced on Tuesday, November 7, that it had secured €50 million in funding. The new funds come in addition to the first €15 million raised in 2021. This amount, which makes the deal one of the year's 15 largest rounds of funding for a French start-up, confirms the growing appeal of quantum computing to investors. In January, Pasqal, one of Quandela's competitors, raised €100 million for its second funding round just a year and a half after an initial round of €25 million.Of this amount, €9.5 million, from the ""First Factory"" initiative of the France 2030 state investment plan, will pay for the Quandela factory in Massy (in the Paris region), inaugurated in June, from which Europe's very first quantum computer has just been delivered to a private industrial customer. It has been installed in a data center belonging to the French OVHcloud group, which can then rent out its computing capacity to its own customers.The balance of €50 million was paid by Quandela's four historical shareholders: Bpifrance and the Quantonation, Omnes and Serena funds. Crédit Mutuel Innovation took advantage of the transaction to acquire a stake in Quandela. Lastly, Europe, through the European Innovation Council fund, made a contribution, ""giving Quandela an international dimension,"" according to Niccolo Somaschi, one of Quandela's three founders and current chief technology officer.In addition to financing the ramp-up of production at the Massy plant (Quandela plans to assemble three new machines in 2024), the aim of this second round of funding since the company was founded in 2017 is also to give it a foothold abroad, in countries like South Korea and Canada, where national quantum plans have been launched.Subsequently, Quandela is not ruling out options in the United States. ""The entry barrier there is high but we think there's one trick left to play. We're going to start working on a dedicated strategy,"" explained Somaschi. In his opinion ""France has a high-quality quantum ecosystem, with excellent researchers and entrepreneurs. We shouldn't have any complications."" The international aura of Alain Aspect, winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on quantum physics, also lends credibility to French expertise in this field. He is one of the co-founders of Pasqal and a member of Quandela's scientific advisory board.",Pixels,promise quantum computing increasingly reflected figures quandela one french start ups involved manufacture new generation supercomputers announced tuesday november secured million funding new funds come addition first million raised amount makes deal one years largest rounds funding french start confirms growing appeal quantum computing investors january pasqal one quandelas competitors raised million second funding round year half initial round million amount million first factory initiative france state investment plan pay quandela factory massy paris region inaugurated june europes first quantum computer delivered private industrial customer installed data center belonging french ovhcloud group rent computing capacity customers balance million paid quandelas four historical shareholders bpifrance quantonation omnes serena funds dit mutuel innovation took advantage transaction acquire stake quandela lastly europe european innovation council fund made contribution giving quandela international dimension according niccolo somaschi one quandelas three founders current chief technology officer addition financing ramp production massy plant quandela plans assemble three new machines aim second round funding since company founded also give foothold abroad countries like south korea canada national quantum plans launched subsequently quandela ruling options united states entry barrier high think theres one trick left play going start working dedicated strategy explained somaschi opinion france high quality quantum ecosystem excellent researchers entrepreneurs shouldnt complications international aura alain aspect winner nobel prize physics work quantum physics also lends credibility french expertise field one founders pasqal member quandelas scientific advisory board,promis quantum comput increasingli reflect figur quandela one french start up involv manufactur new gener supercomput announc tuesday novemb secur million fund new fund come addit first million rais amount make deal one year largest round fund french start confirm grow appeal quantum comput investor januari pasqal one quandela competitor rais million second fund round year half initi round million amount million first factori initi franc state invest plan pay quandela factori massi pari region inaugur june europ first quantum comput deliv privat industri custom instal data center belong french ovhcloud group rent comput capac custom balanc million paid quandela four histor sharehold bpifranc quanton omn serena fund dit mutuel innov took advantag transact acquir stake quandela lastli europ european innov council fund made contribut give quandela intern dimens accord niccolo somaschi one quandela three founder current chief technolog offic addit financ ramp product massi plant quandela plan assembl three new machin aim second round fund sinc compani found also give foothold abroad countri like south korea canada nation quantum plan launch subsequ quandela rule option unit state entri barrier high think there one trick left play go start work dedic strategi explain somaschi opinion franc high qualiti quantum ecosystem excel research entrepreneur shouldnt complic intern aura alain aspect winner nobel prize physic work quantum physic also lend credibl french expertis field one founder pasqal member quandela scientif advisori board
Hollywood actors and studios reach tentative deal to end strike,    The Screen Actors Guild called off its 118-day strike from midnight on Thursday after finally reaching an agreement with the likes of Disney and Netflix for a new contract including higher pay and protections against the use of AI. ,"Hollywood actors and studios reached a tentative deal on Wednesday, November 8, to end a months-long strike that has crippled the entertainment industry, delayed hundreds of popular shows and films, and cost billions to the US economy.The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) called off its 118-day strike from midnight after finally reaching an agreement with the likes of Disney and Netflix for a new contract including higher pay and protections against the use of artificial intelligence.The announcement paves the way for actors to head back to movie sets, an end to picket lines outside studios and a return to employment for thousands of other jobs linked to the entertainment industry. ""In a unanimous vote this afternoon, the SAG-AFTRA TV/Theatrical Committee approved a tentative agreement (...) bringing an end to the 118-day strike,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement.In a message sent to union members, negotiators said the contract was valued at more than $1 billion and would enable members ""to build sustainable careers.""The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, said it was ""pleased"" to have reached a deal, and trumpeted a ""brand new residual for streaming programs,"" without offering details. Residuals are long-term payments for shows after their initial release. The deal still needs to be ratified. That process could take weeks, but the agreement is widely expected to pass.Talks between the two sides had taken place almost daily for the past two weeks, with CEOs of studios including Disney, Netflix, Warner and Universal often attending personally, as the clamor for a deal grew. Given the duration of the strike, studios already face gaping holes in their release schedules for next year and beyond, while many actors have been forced to find second jobs or quit the business.The news spread instantly across Hollywood, with celebrities expressing joy and relief. ""Incredible! I'm so happy we were all able to come to an agreement. Let's get back to work! Let's go! I'm so stoked,"" Zac Efron told reporters at a premiere of The Iron Claw. ""Perseverance pays off!"" wrote Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis on Instagram.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass welcomed the ""fair agreement"" that had been reached, noting that the strikes had ""impacted millions in Los Angeles and throughout the country."" ""Now, we must lean in on local production to ensure that our entertainment industry rebounds stronger than ever and our economy is able to get back on its feet,"" she said in a statement.When SAG-AFTRA walked out in mid-July, Hollywood writers were also on strike, but they have since resolved their contract dispute.In resolving the standoff between actors and studios on Wednesday, both sides compromised on minimum pay, settling on an increase from the previous contract of around 8%. That is less than actors originally wanted but higher than writers obtained, and the biggest increase in decades. An improved bonus structure for starring in hit shows or films was also eventually agreed.The growth of streaming platforms, which typically pay minimal ""residuals"" when a hit show gets rewatched, has severely eroded actors' incomes. AI proved a major sticking point in the final stretch of negotiations, with talks often struggling to keep pace with the rapid advances in the technology.Actors fear AI could be used to clone their voices and likenesses, and wanted stricter rules about the compensation and consent studios would need to obtain than the companies were willing to give. Details of the deal will be published following a SAG-AFTRA board meeting to review the terms on Friday, the union said.",Pixels,hollywood actors studios reached tentative deal wednesday november end

"EU launches investigation into YouTube, TikTok over child protection","    The European Union said it wanted to know what measures the video-sharing platforms have taken to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA), in particular regarding the risks posed to children's mental and physical health. ","The EU announced investigations on Thursday, November 9, into YouTube and TikTok to find out what action the US and Chinese-owned platforms are taking to ensure the safety of minors on their platforms.The European Commission said it had sent formal requests for information to TikTok and YouTube respectively, the first step in procedures launched under the EU's new law on digital content.The EU's executive arm said it wanted to know what measures the video-sharing platforms have taken to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA), especially regarding the risks posed to children's mental and physical health.The DSA is part of the European Union's powerful armory to bring big tech to heel, and demands that digital giants do more to counter the spread of illegal and harmful content as well as disinformation. Platforms face fines that can go up to 6% of global turnover for violations.TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is particularly popular with younger users, while YouTube is part of the Alphabet digital empire that includes Google. Both companies must respond by November 30.The EU's top tech enforcer, Thierry Breton, said in August that ""child protection will be an enforcement priority"" for the DSA. The law has also banned targeted advertising to minors aged 17 and under.The EU already launched probes into TikTok, X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook-parent Meta over disinformation following the October 7 Hamas attack in Israel.The DSA also demands tech behemoths do more to counter the spread of illegal goods. The commission on Monday announced it kickstarted an investigation into China's AliExpress over what actions it is taking to protect consumers online from illegal products, including fake medicines, as part of DSA compliance.The DSA came into force in August for 19 sites designated by the EU as ""very large"" platforms that have more than 45 million monthly active users, including Google Search, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Amazon and Apple's AppStore.Smaller digital firms will have to comply with the DSA from February next year, when EU member states will have set up national supervisory authorities.TikTok and YouTube are also among 22 services listed by the EU in September that face stricter curbs on how they do business under the DSA's sister law, the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

'Phobos' ransomware: Two Russians arrested following a dozen attacks in France,"    The couple, arrested in Italy, is suspected of working with this group since at least 2020. Little known, Phobos has nonetheless affected 200 recorded victims throughout France. ","Three years since the start of a series of ransomware attacks, police operations have increased manifold. Ransomware is the name for any malicious tool used by hackers to paralyze computer networks and demand a ransom for their release. This time, France has managed to nab two suspects whose profiles are highly sought-after. A Russian couple living in Saint Petersburg were arrested at Milan airport this summer. The arrest was in connection with a European arrest warrant issued by the French authorities, Le Monde has learned from corroborating sources.The two suspects, a man and a woman in their 30s, are suspected of working on behalf of the Phobos ransomware group. They were brought before an investigating magistrate in Paris and indicted on October 27 on charges of fraudulent access, maintenance, obstruction and modification of an automated data processing system, extortion and aggravated money laundering as part of an organized group, and criminal conspiracy. Both have been placed in pre-trial detention.They are suspected of being so-called ""affiliates"" of the Phobos group, i.e. hackers recruited in certain chatrooms or forums, who rent the ransomware, penetrate their victims’ networks themselves and then share the ransom with the virus' developers. While it is always difficult to trace the perpetrators of this type of operation, in this case, investigators from the cybercrime unit of the Police Prefecture (BL2C) were first able, over the course of the year, to link several attacks committed on French territory to two actors with very similar methods. Then, thanks to cooperation with other international investigation services, they were able to identify these two people and issue a European arrest warrant.Analysis of cryptocurrency flows has linked the pair to at least 150 ransomware payments worldwide, including a dozen actions against French entities since 2020.

Digital giants' AI domination already raises concerns,"    American digital firms Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have seized the lion's share of the AI market, raising the question of government regulation of this strategic sector. ","""Historically, we've seen that these moments of technological inflection points can be really important for injecting competition into the market. Right? If you have incumbents, one way to actually have competition is for there to be totally new technology that renders those incumbents obsolete. I think with AI [artificial intelligence], we are already hearing some concerns."" This observation was made on November 3 by Lina Khan, president of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the US competition agency, in an interview with Bloomberg Telvision, which had asked her about the risk of seeing the digital domination already established by Google, Microsoft, Meta (Facebook, Instagram), and Amazon replicated with AI.This issue also came up at the summit on the risks associated with AI organized by the UK at the beginning of November, though it was initially focused on the possibility of seeing software overcome human control or encourage the launch of cyber or biological attacks: ""We run the risk of seeing the dominance of a handful of private players over our economies and institutions further reinforced,"" warned Amba Kak, director of the AI Now Institute, an NGO that studies the social and ethical implications of AI. French digital affairs minister Jean-Noël Barrot voiced concern about the ""constitution of monopolies,"" while a letter signed by numerous researchers and startup directors warned of the ""concentration of power"" in AI.""The US government is rightly concerned with a fair and level playing field [...] Self preferencing will kill competition and destroy choice for the consumer,"" Garry Tan, head of Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, posted on X on November 4. This comment is reminiscent of the accusation that the digital giants have sometimes favored their own services on their search engines, mobile environments, e-commerce platforms, and so on.And yet the recent AI boom has seen the emergence of new actors and leaders, such as OpenAI, the creator of the chatbot ChatGPT, and Sam Altman, its 38-year-old CEO. But the startup is already closely linked to Microsoft, which has invested $11 billion (€10.3 billion) in it. A co-founder of OpenAI, businessman Elon Musk lamented in February that the project, conceived as a ""counterweight to Google,"" was now ""controlled by Microsoft.""If Altman sought out this heavyweight of the cloud – online services for businesses – it was to gain access to its enormous computing capacities needed for AI: Running ChatGPT was already costing $700,000 a day in February, according to the website SemiAnalysis. Another AI startup, Anthropic, has just accepted $4 billion in investment from Amazon and $2 billion from Google.

Estonian education and research minister: 'AI is within our education system already',"    Since its independence, the smallest of the Baltic States has built up digital public services and continues to innovate in this field, explains Kristina Kallas. ","A pioneer in the digitization of government and public institutions, Estonia is now preparing its society for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. While visiting Paris in November, Estonia's minister of education and research, Kristina Kallas, told Le Monde about the strategy the Baltic country has been deploying in this area for the past 40 years. It started in 1990, after we regained our independence. We were basically facing the reality of we have to rebuild our country, rebuild our economy, rebuild a new political system and rebuild the governance structures. And I think like in every way in public sector, innovation happens when you take away money. That's when there came the understanding to let's use the most modern technologies to build our governance structures because that saves us a lot of money.We have calculated that at least 2% of state GDP is saved, which means that you have less government spending of the GDP due to the collective use of digital technologies. You have less bureaucracy, fewer procedures and fewer resources spent on not very productive work. Of course, it also meant that you have to have a very open-minded culture toward technology. This was the hardest part of the process.We did have quite heavy debates in society about whether this is safe and whether this is reasonable because the digital signature system requires that not only the government be digital, but the people need to have a digital identity. Eventually, I think the consensus was reached quite fast. People do trust that it's safe because it's protected, privacy is protected and it's cyber attack protected. We have been able to develop constantly further services. We have been able to do voting electronically [since 2005].It means that 99% of services that you need to communicate with the state in order to receive, you do it digitally through your digital identity. I do all my services online. I am 50 years old, almost. I have never filed taxes on paper ever in my life because the year 2000, when the electronic tax reporting system came, was also my entry into the labor market. It's pre-filled with the data. You need to just check it. It takes me usually 3 to 5 minutes.In the next phase that we're doing now with public services, we want to use personalized public services so that like with the tax declaration, if I log in, then for my purposes and for my information, it is already pre-filled. [For example], every time I go to ask for my mother's care services, I don't have to constantly fill it in. [I don't] have to go and start looking at what the state can offer me, but the state tells me. For example, you have a mother who needs 24-hour care, and we know that because that's what you have reported to us. So basically [I just have to go] on the phone and say, ""Yes, I need this service.""",Pixels,pioneer digitization government public institutions estonia preparing society artificial intelligence revolution visiting paris november estonias minister education research kristina kallas told monde strategy baltic country deploying area past years started regained independence basically facing reality rebuild country rebuild economy rebuild new political system rebuild governance structures think like every way public sector innovation happens take away money thats came understanding lets use modern technologies build governance structures saves lot money calculated least state gdp saved means less government spending gdp due collective use digital technologies less bureaucracy fewer procedures fewer resources spent productive work course also meant open minded culture toward technology hardest part process quite heavy debates society whether safe whether reasonable digital signature system requires government digital people need digital identity eventually think consensus reached quite fast people trust safe protected privacy protected cyber attack protected able develop constantly services able voting electronically since means services need communicate state order receive digitally digital identity services online years old almost never filed taxes paper ever life year electronic tax reporting system came also entry labor market pre filled data need check takes usually minutes next phase public services want use personalized public services like tax declaration log purposes information already pre filled example every time ask mothers care services dont constantly fill dont start looking state offer state tells example mother needs hour care know thats reported basically phone say yes need service,pioneer digit govern public institut estonia prepar societi artifici intellig revolut visit pari novemb estonia minist educ research kristina kalla told mond strategi baltic countri deploy area past year start regain independ basic face realiti rebuild countri rebuild economi rebuild new polit system rebuild govern structur think like everi way public sector innov happen take away money that came understand let use modern technolog build govern structur save lot money calcul least state gdp save mean less govern spend gdp due collect use digit technolog less bureaucraci fewer procedur fewer resourc spent product work cours also meant open mind cultur toward technolog hardest part process quit heavi debat societi whether safe whether reason digit signatur system requir govern digit peopl need digit ident eventu think consensu reach quit fast peopl trust safe protect privaci protect cyber attack protect abl develop constantli servic abl vote electron sinc mean servic need commun state order receiv digit digit ident servic onlin year old almost never file tax paper ever life year electron tax report system came also entri labor market pre fill data need check take usual minut next phase public servic want use person public servic like tax declar log purpos inform alreadi pre fill exampl everi time ask mother care servic dont constantli fill dont start look state offer state tell exampl mother need hour care know that report basic phone say ye need servic
"Content moderation: Key facts to learn from Facebook, Instagram, X and TikTok transparency reports","    Transparency reports, which have become mandatory since the DSA came into effect, reveal some of the inner workings of the major social media companies, including their number of human moderators, their error rates, and how quickly they comply with EU member states' requests. ","At the beginning of November, the major social media companies that hadn't already done so submitted their transparency reports for 2023, required for the first time by the European Union (EU) under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which came into effect at the end of August. In addition to general statistics on their services, such as the number of users, these documents give unprecedented insight into the resources dedicated by Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok, and others to the moderation of illegal, hateful, or fraudulent content.These reports should be treated and compared to one another with a grain of salt, as there are many methodological differences between the social media companies, the observation periods do not always correspond to the six months required by the EU, and, above all, a great deal of information is missing, with Snapchat's and YouTube's reports being the worst in terms of omissions.These files do, however, shed some light on the number of moderators responsible for deleting problematic posts. A comparison of the figures shows that TikTok, a social media company with a Chinese parent company, claims the highest number of moderators: Four times more than Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, which boasts the highest number of users in Europe.How can this discrepancy be explained? In its transparency report, the American-run Meta specifies that its workforce outside the EU includes other moderators capable, in the event of a peak in activity in the region, of intervening in English, French, or Spanish.Meta also highlights the efficiency of its artificial intelligence (AI) moderation tools, which TikTok does not emphasize. The rate of moderation automation is very high at Meta: At Facebook and Instagram, respectively, 94% and 98% of decisions are made by machines – far more than the 45% reported by TikTok.However, AI is not always effective compared to human moderation, as demonstrated by the revelations from the ""Facebook Files,"" internal Meta files released in 2021 by whistleblower Frances Haugen. In its transparency report, LinkedIn is also one of the few platforms to make the error rate of its automatic content deletion tools public: it is estimated at 10% for English-language publications, 30% for German, 37% for French, and 80% for Spanish.For their part, Snapchat and X have decided not to communicate their moderation staffing levels for Europe alone and to give global numbers instead.

"Oregon, the beautiful mystery of the American West","    Stuck between the mountains and the Pacific Ocean, this little-known state has kept much of its wilderness. The fabulous scenery of its coast inspired the local writer Frank Herbert, creator of 'Dune.' ","An old joke has long circulated on the plains and mountains of the American Northwest. After the Oregon Trail was inaugurated, opening a passage through the Rocky Mountains, immigrants from the New World were faced with a curious dilemma when an (imaginary) sign appeared: to the left, California, with its promise of gold and sunshine; to the right, Oregon, with its more austere lands and rather humid climate. Legend has it that at this moment, only those who could not read turned right.As is often the case, this quip has a grain of truth: The people of the American Northwest have an inferiority complex toward their great neighbors in the South, the inhabitants of the Golden State. Indeed, few states have such tourist attractions as the beaches of Monterey, the giant redwoods of Yosemite National Park and the misty atmosphere of San Francisco Bay.Yet who needs these beauties when your state is home to natural treasures like Crater Lake, a stunning volcanic lake; Mount Hood, the snow-capped jewel of the Cascade Range; or Portland, a city often referred to as one of the most livable in the United States? Which state has more and better to offer than a coastline that has remained wild along the Pacific Ocean, from the rocks of Cannon Beach in the north to those of Gold Beach near the California border and to the stunning dune strip that stretches south from Florence?It was while visiting Dunes City, a massive tangle of wetlands and sandy hills, that Frank Herbert (1920-1986) was inspired to write his famous science fiction novel, Dune, published in 1965 in the United States and 1970 in France, before giving birth to two blockbuster films.Born in Tacoma, Washington, the future novelist spent part of his youth in Salem, Oregon's capital, and then in Portland. In 1957, the young journalist had come to the Florence area to study the movement of the dunes and the region's herbaceous plants. The article was never published, but his observations, research and also, it seems, his repeated experiments with ""magic mushrooms"" led to one of science fiction literature's most celebrated creations.The dunes ""could swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways,"" Frank Herbert is said to have written to a friend after his visit, impressed by the traces of the battle that he imagined having taken place there between men and nature, in what became the Oregon National Dunes Recreation Area.Before the arrival of European settlers, the Siuslaw, Coquille and Umpqua tribes had long lived here in the middle of Douglas fir forests, the great pride of Oregon, by adapting to these shifting dunes and the water that seeps in everywhere. Since then, these bodies of water have been channeled wherever possible. Large-scale fishing and logging have altered the landscapes, transformed the customs and caused the near disappearance of the beavers (another pride of Oregon, nicknamed the Beaver State) and salmons to stay away.",Travel,old joke long circulated plains mountains american northwest oregon trail inaugurated opening passage rocky mountains immigrants new world faced curious dilemma imaginary sign appeared left california promise gold sunshine right oregon austere lands rather humid climate legend moment could read turned right often case quip grain truth people american northwest inferiority complex toward great neighbors south inhabitants golden state indeed states tourist attractions beaches monterey giant redwoods yosemite national park misty atmosphere san francisco bay yet needs beauties state home natural treasures like crater lake stunning volcanic lake mount hood snow capped jewel cascade range portland city often referred one livable united states state better offer coastline remained wild along pacific ocean rocks cannon beach north gold beach near california border stunning dune strip stretches south florence visiting dunes city massive tangle wetlands sandy hills frank herbert inspired write famous science fiction novel dune published united states france giving birth two blockbuster films born tacoma washington future novelist spent part youth salem oregons capital portland young journalist come florence area study movement dunes regions herbaceous plants article never published observations research also seems repeated experiments magic mushrooms led one science fiction literatures celebrated creations dunes could swallow whole cities lakes rivers highways frank herbert said written friend visit impressed traces battle imagined taken place men nature became oregon national dunes recreation area arrival european settlers siuslaw coquille umpqua tribes long lived middle douglas fir forests great pride oregon adapting shifting dunes water seeps everywhere since bodies water channeled wherever possible large scale fishing logging altered landscapes transformed customs caused near disappearance beavers another pride oregon nicknamed beaver state salmons stay away,old joke long circul plain mountain american northwest oregon trail inaugur open passag rocki mountain immigr new world face curiou dilemma imaginari sign appear left california promis gold sunshin right oregon auster land rather humid climat legend moment could read turn right often case quip grain truth peopl american northwest inferior complex toward great neighbor south inhabit golden state inde state tourist attract beach monterey giant redwood yosemit nation park misti atmospher san francisco bay yet need beauti state home natur treasur like crater lake stun volcan lake mount hood snow cap jewel cascad rang portland citi often refer one livabl unit state state better offer coastlin remain wild along pacif ocean rock cannon beach north gold beach near california border stun dune strip stretch south florenc visit dune citi massiv tangl wetland sandi hill frank herbert inspir write famou scienc fiction novel dune publish unit state franc give birth two blockbust film born tacoma washington futur novelist spent part youth salem oregon capit portland young journalist come florenc area studi movement dune region herbac plant articl never publish observ research also seem repeat experi magic mushroom led one scienc fiction literatur celebr creation dune could swallow whole citi lake river highway frank herbert said written friend visit impress trace battl imagin taken place men natur becam oregon nation dune recreat area arriv european settler siuslaw coquil umpqua tribe long live middl dougla fir forest great pride oregon adapt shift dune water seep everywher sinc bodi water channel wherev possibl larg scale fish log alter landscap transform custom caus near disappear beaver anoth pride oregon nicknam beaver state salmon stay away
Five stopover villages on the road to vacation in France,"    Forget the impersonal highway rest areas. On the road to vacation, it's time to make a real stopover in one of France's 73 stopover villages. ","What is a village étape (""stopover village"")? It is a town located less than 5 kilometers from a highway or a national road, but it is not always a village. Sometimes it is a small town with less than 5,000 inhabitants. Stopover villages (which can be found in the Routard guide Villages étapes) must offer shops and activities capable of properly welcoming travelers. There are currently 73 of them on 36 roads across nine regions and 31 departments.You can appreciate Beaufort cheese and street art ""at the same time."" The proof is in Moûtiers, which did not wait for the creation of the stopover village label in 1992 to see travelers passing through. The (small) capital of the Tarentaise valley was already an important stop on the Roman road that linked Milan to Vienna two millennia ago. Today, you can discover a path of monumental frescoes whose colors liven the walls of the houses. There are about 40 works with evocative titles: 'The Jam' in the Carrefour parking garage or 'Le Touriste' at Place de la Gare. A free app – St'art – and a leaflet available at the tourist office list them all. Whet your appetite on this urban hike and head to the Moûtiers Dairy Cooperative for a free visit with a presentation of a multitude of local products and, at the end, a cheese tasting.Was Nicolas Peyrac referring to his childhood village when he wrote his hit ""So Far Away From L.A.""? Possibly, because, to be honest, Saint-Brice-en-Coglès – simply known as ""cogle"" – is quite far away from everything! It is the gateway to Brittany for those who enter from the north, through the Coglais, an area that is not well known even by the Bretons themselves. However, located between Fougères and Mont-Saint-Michel, Saint-Brice-en-Coglès is worth a visit, in particular to discover the splendid Rocher-Portail château and its wonderful gardens on the edge of a pond and the Echelles stream. The massive granite structure was built between 1596 and 1617 on elegant square plans. This private property can be visited and has a certain ""je-ne-sais-quoi"" like the famous Downton Abbey house. The most enthusiastic may decide to stay overnight, when the château is lit up by candlelight, before a musical performance and the firework finale.Jarnac owes its notoriety to François Mitterrand, the local child who was born there in 1916, became the president of France in 1981 and has been resting there since 1996. You can visit his family home, which doubles as a museum where gifts received from his time at the Elysée Palace have been collected. The tomb in the Grand'Maisons cemetery attracts the curious and political pilgrims. Beyond this nostalgia, Jarnac reveals itself as a small town full of charm that is nicely nestled along the right bank of the Charente. The city of Cognac is 15 kilometers downstream, but major cognac houses are based in Jarnac, including Courvoisier, Hine and Delamain. At Courvoisier, you can visit the cellar and discover the secrets of cognac making before moving on to the tasting, which is of course forbidden to whoever is driving!",Travel,village tape stopover village town located less kilometers highway national road always village sometimes small town less inhabitants stopover villages found routard guide villages tapes must offer shops activities capable properly welcoming travelers currently roads across nine regions departments appreciate beaufort cheese street art time proof tiers wait creation stopover village label see travelers passing small capital tarentaise valley already important stop roman road linked milan vienna two millennia ago today discover path monumental frescoes whose colors liven walls houses works evocative titles jam carrefour parking garage touriste place gare free app start leaflet available tourist office list whet appetite urban hike head tiers dairy cooperative free visit presentation multitude local products end cheese tasting nicolas peyrac referring childhood village wrote hit far away possibly honest saint brice cogl simply known cogle quite far away everything gateway brittany enter north coglais area well known even bretons however located foug res mont saint michel saint brice cogl worth visit particular discover splendid rocher portail teau wonderful gardens edge pond echelles stream massive granite structure built elegant square plans private property visited certain sais quoi like famous downton abbey house enthusiastic may decide stay overnight teau lit candlelight musical performance firework finale jarnac owes notoriety fran ois mitterrand local child born became president france resting since visit family home doubles museum gifts received time elys palace collected tomb grandmaisons cemetery attracts curious political pilgrims beyond nostalgia jarnac reveals small town full charm nicely nestled along right bank charente city cognac kilometers downstream major cognac houses based jarnac including courvoisier hine delamain courvoisier visit cellar discover secrets cognac making moving tasting course forbidden whoever driving,villag tape stopov villag town locat less kilomet highway nation road alway villag sometim small town less inhabit stopov villag found routard guid villag tape must offer shop activ capabl properli welcom travel current road across nine region depart appreci beaufort chees street art time proof tier wait creation stopov villag label see travel pass small capit tarentais valley alreadi import stop roman road link milan vienna two millennia ago today discov path monument fresco whose color liven wall hous work evoc titl jam carrefour park garag tourist place gare free app start leaflet avail tourist offic list whet appetit urban hike head tier dairi cooper free visit present multitud local product end chees tast nicola peyrac refer childhood villag wrote hit far away possibl honest saint brice cogl simpli known cogl quit far away everyth gateway brittani enter north coglai area well known even breton howev locat foug re mont saint michel saint brice cogl worth visit particular discov splendid rocher portail teau wonder garden edg pond echel stream massiv granit structur built eleg squar plan privat properti visit certain sai quoi like famou downton abbey hous enthusiast may decid stay overnight teau lit candlelight music perform firework final jarnac owe notorieti fran oi mitterrand local child born becam presid franc rest sinc visit famili home doubl museum gift receiv time eli palac collect tomb grandmaison cemeteri attract curiou polit pilgrim beyond nostalgia jarnac reveal small town full charm nice nestl along right bank charent citi cognac kilomet downstream major cognac hous base jarnac includ courvoisi hine delamain courvoisi visit cellar discov secret cognac make move tast cours forbidden whoever drive
Five French villages with a hundred shades of red,"    From the North to the South, some villages display a hundred shades of the same color, red. ","Whether they are medieval or more recent, French villages, from Roussillon to Cléry-sur-Somme through Meyssac, are adorned with red. From the ochre facades in Vaucluse to the sandstone in Correze and orange bricks in Picardy or Sologne, the many shades of red invite the visitor to explore these villages as colorful as they are contrasting, with reds ranging from deep blood red to coral to crimson.From ripe apricot to scarlet through vermilion: The facades of Roussillon (Vaucluse), adorned with light green shutters, display a wide range of colors that makes the village stand out from other Provencal localities, where dry stone dominates.Situated on a rocky spur between the Ventoux and the Luberon, the village, classified as one of the most beautiful in France, is the capital of ochre, a dye that has long been used by the manufacturing sector and is still an artists' favorite. In the Okhra eco-museum, an old factory where ochre was ""washed,"" an operation consisting of separating the sand from the pigment, visitors will discover the history of the material.Roussillon is the starting point for the Ochre Trail, a walk through a former quarry with a lunar-like appearance. The trail twists and turns between dark orange fairy chimneys, these large rock columns capped with a block contrast with the raw green of the pines and cypresses. A picture-postcard landscape.Clay and wood. The Solognots have built their houses from these forest resources. In Ligny-le-Ribault (Loiret), clay bricks are everywhere, lined up like Lego to form walls, piled up between the wooden sides, adorning the facades with decorative motifs or raising the door and window frames.The village, which was built around the Sologne castles, is even home to the last remaining artisanal brick factory in the region, the Tuilerie de Bretèche, founded in 1890. Its products, of various shapes and colors, are used to restore historical monuments throughout the region and beyond.Don't miss the town hall, a superb building cleverly decorated with different colored bricks. Those who love the countryside will enjoy the ""natural region, where life is good, between castles, hiking trails and birdsong,"" said Anne Gaborit, mayor of the village.On the Place aux Arceaux, in the center of the fortified town founded in the early 14th century, the sanguine color of the shutters, lintels, beams and wood paneling contrasts with the whiteness of the lime.

Dakhla: A windswept lagoon in Morocco,"    In the very south of Morocco, this immense expanse of salt water with its white sandy beaches is the ideal spot for kitesurfers. It is also a paradise for migratory birds. ","As you leave Dakhkla airport, don’t be taken in by the long, straight avenues typical of Moroccan urbanism from the 2000s. Because while the city emerges out of the dune ridge, it is the lagoon that makes Dakhla a grandiose site. A vast expanse of salt water located in the extreme south of Morocco, this curved ecological treasure, 37 kilometers long and almost 400 square kilometers in size, is a paradise for migratory birds, biodiversity in general and kitesurfing enthusiasts in particular.Dakhla is located in the Western Sahara, which is the subject of an unresolved international dispute. In 1976, after the departure of the former Spanish colonizer, a conflict arose between the Polisario Front (supported by Algeria) and Rabat, which claimed the ""Moroccanness"" of the region. A referendum on self-determination for the Western Sahara, considered by the United Nations as a ""non-self-governing territory,"" was promised by a 1991 Security Council resolution. But the vote never took place because of Moroccan opposition. Morocco now controls 80% of the area, while the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic has influence only on its eastern and southern margins (20%).Since 2005, the bay has been classified as a Ramsar site, a protected wetland of international importance. Between the Atlantic Ocean and the Sahara Desert, the lagoon is on the migratory route of birds between Africa and Europe. The pink flamingos have settled there, but the great cormorants of Morocco are only passing through, along with dozens of other species of sea birds.Under the surface of the water, on the ocean side, fishermen pull out groupers, sea bass and curlews. Surfcasting, fishing on foot from the shore ""in the wave,"" is practiced day and night. The peaceful tides and calm waters of the lagoon also make it a popular place for shellfish farming. The oysters of Dakhla, which look like our own special ones, are fat and subtle. They can be sampled everywhere, at hotel tables or outside the traps at Talha Mar, an oyster farm that also has a restaurant.The fiddler crab remains the most familiar resident of the lagoon. At the Dakhla Attitude Hotel, the muddy areas where these crustaceans live are protected by signs that say ""Please do not walk on our homes."" The oversized claw that the males sport has become the hotel's logo.Ideal for kitesurfing, Dakhla Attitude is the oldest accommodation in the bay and the one with the most beautiful location on the lagoon. Its nautical base, now mythical in the kitesurfing community, offers all types of water sports, including the latest craze, wing foil. Like the other hotels at the bottom of the lagoon, Dakhla Attitude is largely reserved for those who ""kite"" or want to discover the sport, which is actually much easier than it seems. After a week and a dozen lessons, kitesurfing already offers a real sense of enjoyment, enough to choose – or not – to do it again.",Travel,leave dakhkla airport taken long straight avenues moroccan urbanism city emerges dune ridge lagoon makes dakhla grandiose site vast expanse salt water located extreme south morocco curved ecological treasure kilometers long almost square kilometers size paradise migratory birds biodiversity general kitesurfing enthusiasts particular dakhla located western sahara subject unresolved international dispute departure former spanish colonizer conflict arose polisario front supported algeria rabat claimed moroccanness region referendum self determination western sahara considered united nations non self governing territory promised security council resolution vote never took place moroccan opposition morocco controls area sahrawi arab democratic republic influence eastern southern margins since bay classified ramsar site protected wetland international importance atlantic ocean sahara desert lagoon migratory route birds africa europe pink flamingos settled great cormorants morocco passing along dozens species sea birds surface water ocean side fishermen pull groupers sea bass curlews surfcasting fishing foot shore wave practiced day night peaceful tides calm waters lagoon also make popular place shellfish farming oysters dakhla look like special ones fat subtle sampled everywhere hotel tables outside traps talha mar oyster farm also restaurant fiddler crab remains familiar resident lagoon dakhla attitude hotel muddy areas crustaceans live protected signs say please walk homes oversized claw males sport become hotels logo ideal kitesurfing dakhla attitude oldest accommodation bay one beautiful location lagoon nautical base mythical kitesurfing community offers types water sports including latest craze wing foil like hotels bottom lagoon dakhla attitude largely reserved kite want discover sport actually much easier seems week dozen lessons kitesurfing already offers real sense enjoyment enough choose,leav dakhkla airport taken long straight avenu moroccan urban citi emerg dune ridg lagoon make dakhla grandios site vast expans salt water locat extrem south morocco curv ecolog treasur kilomet long almost squar kilomet size paradis migratori bird biodivers gener kitesurf enthusiast particular dakhla locat western sahara subject unresolv intern disput departur former spanish colon conflict aros polisario front support algeria rabat claim moroccan region referendum self determin western sahara consid unit nation non self govern territori promis secur council resolut vote never took place moroccan opposit morocco control area sahrawi arab democrat republ influenc eastern southern margin sinc bay classifi ramsar site protect wetland intern import atlant ocean sahara desert lagoon migratori rout bird africa europ pink flamingo settl great cormor morocco pass along dozen speci sea bird surfac water ocean side fishermen pull grouper sea bass curlew surfcast fish foot shore wave practic day night peac tide calm water lagoon also make popular place shellfish farm oyster dakhla look like special one fat subtl sampl everywher hotel tabl outsid trap talha mar oyster farm also restaur fiddler crab remain familiar resid lagoon dakhla attitud hotel muddi area crustacean live protect sign say pleas walk home overs claw male sport becom hotel logo ideal kitesurf dakhla attitud oldest accommod bay one beauti locat lagoon nautic base mythic kitesurf commun offer type water sport includ latest craze wing foil like hotel bottom lagoon dakhla attitud larg reserv kite want discov sport actual much easier seem week dozen lesson kitesurf alreadi offer real sens enjoy enough choos

How to spend a weekend in London near St Pancras station,"    Impeccably located in the completely renovated King's Cross area, The Standard Hotel offers a brutalist cocoon for the style and event-loving traveler. ","For a long time, King's Cross was a transient area from where, confronted with fast-food restaurants and shabby hotels, people would flee as soon as they got off the Eurostar. But in the last few years, thanks to a revitalization project for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the area around St Pancras station has become a destination in itself. This change was made official by the opening of The Standard Hotel in 2019. It was the American chain's first establishment outside its country of origin, set up in a former annex of the Camden district town hall: a white brutalist building made up of alcoves and bay windows, with 266 rooms and dating back to 1974.In room 533, there is a striking visual gap between the interior with its '70s sci-fi atmosphere and the exterior, a bird's eye view of the St Pancras Chambers, a majestic brick building built by architect George Gilbert Scott in 1873 and which is now also a hotel. It's fun to observe the elegant, neo-Gothic lines, brick gables and convolutions of the building, as seen in the Harry Potter saga and the Spice Girls's ""Wannabe"" video, from the pristine modernist platform.If you get tired of the brick, you can head down to the library. Here, you can choose from books on sociology, philosophy or gardening, etc. Weekends in London are often boozy, so it is doubtful that phenomenology or landscape manuals are appropriate for the day after the party. Instead, it is better to go back to the futuristic cocoon of your room.The Standard Hotel, 10 Argyle Street. King of Kings room, from 400 euros per night. Lower price room, Cosy Core, from 266 euros. Eurostar, Paris-London round trip, 2 hours 17 minutes, from 93.50 euros.There's a line for the glass elevator, but the view on the ride is worth the wait. Once on the 10th floor, the vibe at Sweeties, The Standard Hotel's cocktail bar, is that of a shady 1970s nightclub: velvet sofas, leather booths, disco balls and even a giant penis sculpture around which guests pose at the end of the night. At the bar, mixologists Jack Sotti and Todd Austin have designed an amazing menu, with drinks like the ""Pick me up,"" made from vodka, cocoa butter, coffee and hallucinogenic mushrooms – the panoramic view of London just might find itself altered.Sweeties, 10 Argyle Street.The Beatles, Charlotte Brontë, Queen Victoria and Christopher Marlowe have little in common, except that they were all British. The British Library preserves the manuscripts of their songs, plays, poems, edicts, diaries etc. The institution's Treasure Room exhibits these paper documents that have left a mark on the country. With a staging of its own history as only the United Kingdom knows how to do, we go from one showcase to another, struck by the 1,000 facets of a national identity.",Travel,long time kings cross transient area confronted fast food restaurants shabby hotels people would flee soon got eurostar last years thanks revitalization project olym london area around pancras station become destination change made official opening standard hotel american chains first establishment outside country origin set former annex camden district town hall white brutalist building made alcoves bay windows rooms dating back room striking visual gap interior sci atmosphere exterior birds eye view pancras chambers majestic brick building built architect george gilbert scott also hotel fun observe elegant neo gothic lines brick gables convolutions building seen harry potter saga spice girlss wannabe video pristine modernist platform get tired brick head library choose books sociology philosophy gardening etc weekends london often boozy doubtful phenomenology landscape manuals appropriate day party instead better back futuristic cocoon room standard hotel argyle street king kings room euros per night lower price room cosy core euros eurostar paris london round trip hours minutes euros theres line glass elevator view ride worth wait floor vibe sweeties standard hotels cocktail bar shady nightclub velvet sofas leather booths disco balls even giant penis sculpture around guests pose end night bar mixologists jack sotti todd austin designed amazing menu drinks like pick made vodka cocoa butter coffee hallucinogenic mushrooms panoramic view london might find altered sweeties argyle street beatles charlotte bront queen victoria christopher marlowe little common except british british library preserves manuscripts songs plays poems edicts diaries etc institutions treasure room exhibits paper documents left mark country staging history united kingdom knows one showcase another struck facets national identity,long time king cross transient area confront fast food restaur shabbi hotel peopl would flee soon got eurostar last year thank revit project olym london area around pancra station becom destin chang made offici open standard hotel american chain first establish outsid countri origin set former annex camden district town hall white brutalist build made alcov bay window room date back room strike visual gap interior sci atmospher exterior bird eye view pancra chamber majest brick build built architect georg gilbert scott also hotel fun observ eleg neo gothic line brick gabl convolut build seen harri potter saga spice girlss wannab video pristin modernist platform get tire brick head librari choos book sociolog philosophi garden etc weekend london often boozi doubt phenomenolog landscap manual appropri day parti instead better back futurist cocoon room standard hotel argyl street king king room euro per night lower price room cosi core euro eurostar pari london round trip hour minut euro there line glass elev view ride worth wait floor vibe sweeti standard hotel cocktail bar shadi nightclub velvet sofa leather booth disco ball even giant peni sculptur around guest pose end night bar mixologist jack sotti todd austin design amaz menu drink like pick made vodka cocoa butter coffe hallucinogen mushroom panoram view london might find alter sweeti argyl street beatl charlott bront queen victoria christoph marlow littl common except british british librari preserv manuscript song play poem edict diari etc institut treasur room exhibit paper document left mark countri stage histori unit kingdom know one showcas anoth struck facet nation ident
"From Paris to London, by bike","    The London-Paris Avenue Verte allows you to go between the two capitals by bike in about 10 days, including the ferry crossing. From Auvers-sur-Oise to the white cliffs of the Seven Sisters, it's a trip that crosses sumptuous natural landscapes at low speed. ","Getting off of your bike seat in Trafalgar Square in the heart of London – 10 days after leaving from the square in front of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris – is the crazy challenge that more and more cyclists are taking up, most commonly with electric bikes. Called the London-Paris Avenue Verte (Greenway), the route covers 470 kilometers of road that is sometimes shared with cars but is mostly made up of greenways.Leaving Paris by bike for a long trip doesn't evoke the same emotions as riding in the capital from one district to another: You have the feeling of escaping, of breaking away. On the Saint-Denis Canal, when the quai de la Charente becomes the quai de l'Allier, Paris was behind us. We rode on the ""Street Art Avenue,"" an urban art trail that links Paris to the Saint-Denis train station. If you choose to go to Maisons-Laffitte by the banks of the Seine, this first stage of 45 kilometers – of which more than 32 kilometers is bike paths – takes three hours without going fast.But as the Saint-Denis basilica and its royal necropolis are on the way, some people want to take a picture in front of the chimera graffitied by the duo JeniAle at the Thiers footbridge. While others go under the RER B bridge in Aubervilliers, transfigured by the colors of the work of graffiti artist Roid. The journey time is a matter of choice between the goal and the thousand opportunities to stop along the way. We understood from the start that, if we have to be flexible, such a journey cannot be improvised.It all started with a rather demanding preparation – the equipment, choosing the route, booking the ferry and the accommodation – with multiple options to choose between a 100% bike adventure, a mix of bike and train and going alone, as a pair or in a group. But above all, the biggest question was to go with or without an accompanying vehicle, to carry the luggage, and why not have the cyclists and their two-wheelers on some parts of the route. Fortunately, there are a number of places to stay and repair shops with the ""Accueil Vélo"" label along the route.Two routes are available to cyclists when leaving the Ile-de-France: one is the longer northern route, which passes through the wonderful streets of Auvers-sur-Oise, its splendid castle, the moving tombs of Vincent and Theo Van Gogh and next the Royaumont Abbey. It then goes through Chantilly and Beauvais. The other is to the south, cutting through Chaussy and Gisors. Both meet in Forges-les-Eaux, the last stop before Dieppe and its breathtaking seafront, which is as straight as an arrow and lulled by the mineral sound of the surf wearing away the pebbles.",Travel,getting bike seat trafalgar square heart london days leaving square front notre dame cathedral paris crazy challenge cyclists taking commonly electric bikes called london paris avenue verte greenway route covers kilometers road sometimes shared cars mostly made greenways leaving paris bike long trip doesnt evoke emotions riding capital one district another feeling escaping breaking away saint denis canal quai charente becomes quai lallier paris behind rode street art avenue urban art trail links paris saint denis train station choose maisons laffitte banks seine first stage kilometers kilometers bike paths takes three hours without going fast saint denis basilica royal necropolis way people want take front chimera graffitied duo jeniale thiers footbridge others rer bridge aubervilliers transfigured colors work graffiti artist roid journey time matter choice goal thousand opportunities stop along way understood start flexible journey improvised started rather demanding preparation equipment choosing route booking ferry accommodation multiple options choose bike adventure mix bike train going alone pair group biggest question without accompanying vehicle carry luggage cyclists two wheelers parts route fortunately number places stay repair shops accueil label along route two routes available cyclists leaving ile france one longer northern route passes wonderful streets auvers sur oise splendid castle moving tombs vincent theo van gogh next royaumont abbey goes chantilly beauvais south cutting chaussy gisors meet forges les eaux last stop dieppe breathtaking seafront straight arrow lulled mineral sound surf wearing away pebbles,get bike seat trafalgar squar heart london day leav squar front notr dame cathedr pari crazi challeng cyclist take commonli electr bike call london pari avenu vert greenway rout cover kilomet road sometim share car mostli made greenway leav pari bike long trip doesnt evok emot ride capit one district anoth feel escap break away saint deni canal quai charent becom quai lallier pari behind rode street art avenu urban art trail link pari saint deni train station choos maison laffitt bank sein first stage kilomet kilomet bike path take three hour without go fast saint deni basilica royal necropoli way peopl want take front chimera graffiti duo jenial thier footbridg other rer bridg aubervilli transfigur color work graffiti artist roid journey time matter choic goal thousand opportun stop along way understood start flexibl journey improvis start rather demand prepar equip choos rout book ferri accommod multipl option choos bike adventur mix bike train go alon pair group biggest question without accompani vehicl carri luggag cyclist two wheeler part rout fortun number place stay repair shop accueil label along rout two rout avail cyclist leav ile franc one longer northern rout pass wonder street auver sur ois splendid castl move tomb vincent theo van gogh next royaumont abbey goe chantilli beauvai south cut chaussi gisor meet forg le eaux last stop diepp breathtak seafront straight arrow lull miner sound surf wear away pebbl
Lufthansa negotiates to avoid new strikes as summer tensions continue,"    The management of the German national airline is negotiating with ground staff who are demanding a salary increase of nearly 10%, and pilots who also want a boost after three years of wage freezes. ","Still no sign of agreement in Frankfurt. Lufthansa negotiators and airport ground staff representatives were to meet again on Thursday, August 4, for a second day of discussions to try to reach an agreement on salary increases for 20,000 people directly employed by the German airline (LH Technik, LH Logistik, etc.) and its subsidiary Lufthansa Cargo.The Ver.di union is demanding a 9.5% pay increase and at least 350 euros more for salaries below 3,700 euros gross. Management is offering 150 euros a month now, an additional 100 euros in January 2023 and, if the group makes a profit, an additional 2% in a year. Another point of contention is the term of the agreement – employees would like to limit it to twelve months, to renegotiate if necessary in a year depending on inflation, while the company would like to lock it in for 18 months.This is the third time this summer that the two sides have attempted to get together. On July 27, the unions organized a strike that blocked more than a thousand flights. At boarding counters, in maintenance, in baggage handling, this 26-hour warning strike affected the vacation departures of 134,000 travelers. August and September are always the two most important months for the company. The stakes are high.On Wednesday morning, the employees were duly ""hopeful"" of a rapid ""breakthrough,"" in the words of the main Ver.di negotiator, Christine Behle. Particularly since the other companies that provide ground services at airports, whether competitors or subcontractors of Lufthansa such as Aviation Handling Services or Aviapartner, paved the way at the start of the week, signing an agreement with Ver.di for significant increases (between 17% and 26% in the next six months).""Given the willingness of smaller companies to raise wages, it is all the more surprising that Lufthansa refuses to do so, disappointing its employees and passengers in the middle of the vacation period,"" noted another Ver.di negotiator, Marvin Rechinsky. He is calling for more ""respect"" in general. This is a slogan on the union's banners in the lobby of the hotel where the negotiations are taking place at Frankfurt airport.Mr. Rechinsky emphasizes the extra workload on employees with the resumption of air traffic after the Covid-19 pandemic. The sector has had to cut back heavily since 2020. It is estimated that one in three jobs has been eliminated. According to a study by the Institute for the World Economy in Kiel, there is currently a shortage of 7,200 qualified employees at German airports. At the end of June, there was a one-kilometer queue for security checks at Cologne-Bonn airport.",Travel,still sign agreement frankfurt lufthansa negotiators airport ground staff representatives meet thursday august second day discussions try reach agreement salary increases people directly employed german airline technik logistik etc subsidiary lufthansa cargo ver union demanding pay increase least euros salaries euros gross management offering euros month additional euros january group makes profit additional year another point contention term agreement employees would like limit twelve months renegotiate necessary year depending inflation company would like lock months third time summer two sides attempted get together july unions organized strike blocked thousand flights boarding counters maintenance baggage handling hour warning strike affected vacation departures travelers august september always two important months company stakes high wednesday morning employees duly hopeful rapid breakthrough words main ver negotiator christine behle particularly since companies provide ground services airports whether competitors subcontractors lufthansa aviation handling services aviapartner paved way start week signing agreement ver significant increases next six months given willingness smaller companies raise wages surprising lufthansa refuses disappointing employees passengers middle vacation period noted another ver negotiator marvin rechinsky calling respect general slogan unions banners lobby hotel negotiations taking place frankfurt airport rechinsky emphasizes extra workload employees resumption air traffic covid pandemic sector cut back heavily since estimated one three jobs eliminated according study institute world economy kiel currently shortage qualified employees german airports end june one kilometer queue security checks cologne bonn airport,still sign agreement frankfurt lufthansa negoti airport ground staff repres meet thursday august second day discuss tri reach agreement salari increas peopl directli employ german airlin technik logistik etc subsidiari lufthansa cargo ver union demand pay increas least euro salari euro gross manag offer euro month addit euro januari group make profit addit year anoth point content term agreement employe would like limit twelv month renegoti necessari year depend inflat compani would like lock month third time summer two side attempt get togeth juli union organ strike block thousand flight board counter mainten baggag handl hour warn strike affect vacat departur travel august septemb alway two import month compani stake high wednesday morn employe duli hope rapid breakthrough word main ver negoti christin behl particularli sinc compani provid ground servic airport whether competitor subcontractor lufthansa aviat handl servic aviapartn pave way start week sign agreement ver signific increas next six month given willing smaller compani rais wage surpris lufthansa refus disappoint employe passeng middl vacat period note anoth ver negoti marvin rechinski call respect gener slogan union banner lobbi hotel negoti take place frankfurt airport rechinski emphas extra workload employe resumpt air traffic covid pandem sector cut back heavili sinc estim one three job elimin accord studi institut world economi kiel current shortag qualifi employe german airport end june one kilomet queue secur check cologn bonn airport
Saving Madeira's laurels from the stampede of mass tourism,Feature,"A sea of clouds crowned the jutting hills of the northern coast of Madeira Island that morning. On the misty heights of this archipelago, situated not very far from the African coast, the humid subtropical vegetation retains the water evaporated from the Atlantic Ocean. Some foliage of intense green laurels appears from the vapor now and then, driven by the trade winds. On the ground, thick tree heathers shroud the already narrow forest road.The sudden flight of a pair of trocaz pigeons with their blue plumage, a wild species endemic to the island, wakes up the hiker from his mediation in this gentle dampness. So this is what it means to be inside a living relic. The laurisilva, Madeira's lauriferous forest, is indeed a natural relic inherited from the Tertiary period. Several tens of millions of years ago, this primary vegetation covered southern Europe and North Africa.Although protected from the last glaciations by its oceanic climate, the Macaronesia archipelago (Madeira, Canary Islands, Azores and Cape Verde) has managed to preserve only remnants of this precious laurel forest. Listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999, Madeira's laurel forest is its largest surviving portion, covering 20% of the island's surface. In 1419, when Portuguese navigators landed there, they named the island ""Madeira"" (which means wood): ""The laurel at that time occupied almost the entire surface of the island. The colonization then gave rise to intense clearing for agriculture and wood exploitation. Fortunately, a precocious forest code prevented the disappearance of this native forest,"" said Helder Spinola, a biologist at the University of Madeira, who takes us into ""his"" forest.On entering the verdant park of Queimadas, 850 meters above sea level in the northeast of the island, the researcher is delighted at the sight of a healthy specimen. ""The laurel is a mother tree for me. It has always been there with me. It gives life to the forest, and shelters birds, insects and mosses. It plays a protective role for biodiversity,"" as he went on endlessly about his favorite tree with large dark green leaves and creamy-white flowers, that give off an exquisite scent. Since childhood, the laurisilva has been his playground. ""We often wandered there with my brothers. Once, we got lost in the middle of the night... What a fright we had,"" he recalled with a smile. ""Above all, I quickly understood that this lush nature was not just a simple forest.""The biologist arrived in Madeira in 1976. His parents had just fled the civil war in Mozambique, another Portuguese colony, where Helder had been born three years earlier. Back in their homeland, the Spinolas settled in the village of Santana, in the northeast of the island. They lived a modest existence in a small house with a thatched roof. At school, the children of these ""repatriates"" were not welcome. But the imposing laurel tree that grew right next to his house has a far greater effect on Helder than the taunts of his classmates. ""I was fascinated by the strength of this tree. Everything had changed around it in 50 years, houses had been destroyed, others built, roads and modern life had come, but this laurel tree had not moved.""The laurel is integral to the daily life of Madeirans. Its fragrant leaves are used in cooking, its wood for skewers and its berries for making oil for treating skin diseases. ""These trees existed well before humans arrived on the island, and their ability to regenerate never ceases to amaze me. See that mushroom growing along the trunk? That's the madre louro. It is rare to see it, it only grows on laurel trees and its presence is proof of the ecosystem's good health,"" the scientist explained. The parasitic fungus, whose shape resembles deer antlers, is an endemic species of Macaronesia.Besides the typical Madeira laurel (Laurus novocanariensis), there are three other species of the same Lauraceae family (til, vinhatico and barbusano) that coexist in the forest. As we enter the laurel forest, the path narrows down so much that it becomes difficult to pass other hikers. As we come out of a hairpin bend, we hear a gushing sound. What our ears imagined to be a waterfall, is actually a stream of water running down plant walls covered with green moss, all the way from the top. This shower of water droplets feeds the irrigation channels that the hiking trail follows.""They are levadas,"" said Mr. Spinola, wiping his glasses fogged by moisture. ""They are the result of an ingenious system that allows the island to never run short of water."" As early as the 16th century, the levadas were designed to carry water from the northern slopes, which receive more water, to the drier southern part of the island, where a majority of the population lives. The construction of these hydraulic works that cross the mountains was a perilous human adventure.On the northern side of the island, the fog is denser that morning. On the very touristic site of Fanal, cows are grazing in a clearing dotted with laurels. The passage of a mist makes this scene appear larger-than-life, which the tourists capture. A sight which does not please Mr. Spinola, who instead notices some weak-looking tree trunks on which only a few small green branches remain.""Laurel trees have the ability, at the base of their trunks, to develop shoots that will form young, strong trunks again, allowing the tree to survive,"" said Mr. Spinola. ""But here in Fanal, these new shoots are destroyed by cattle. There are other places on the island where cows can graze...,"" said the biologist, who has been an active member of Quercus (which means oak), a Portuguese environmental NGO, since he was 21.Concerned, he talks about the deceptive effect of the laurel and its evergreen foliage. ""This permanent spring gives the illusion that all is well. Yet our forest is under attack from all sides."" Further along the path, as he talks about the risk of fires, Mr. Spinola points out several human-introduced species that threaten the laurel forest, such as eucalyptus, acacia and ginger lily.Tourism is another danger looming over Madeira's lush greenery. That day, this problem makes it to the headline of the local edition of Diario de Noticias, featuring a rant"" from the island's guides, who criticize the overcrowding of hiking trails that run through the forest. ""We have already stalled a cable car project that would have brought even more tourists to the heart of the laurisilva. With all the existing levada trails, why concentrate tourists around the same spots?"" said Mr. Spinola. Lesser-known areas such as the Chao da Ribeira valley near Seixal offer beautiful hikes with ideal access to the laurisilva.His greatest fear is the imminent project to tar the road known as ""Ginjas,"" a dirt road opened in the 1980s that runs for 10 kilometers through the heart of the forest. ""We have managed to maintain the laurisilva in Madeira because we have not fragmented it too much. Keeping areas compact, so as to preserve them from tourism and pollution, allows the forest ecosystem to regenerate."" For this biologist campaigner, a relic is not destined to become a tourist attraction.",Travel,sea clouds crowned jutting hills northern coast madeira island morning misty heights archipelago situated

Bask in the sunshine of Bormes-les-Mimosas,    Room 303 of the hotel Le Mirage offers a panoramic view of the Mediterranean coast and its lush landscape. ,"Located around 10 kilometers from the Fort de Brégançon – aka the summer residence of French presidents – the hotel Le Mirage was built in the 1970s. A young man from the Drôme department in southeastern France recently took over as manager – Jules Brenier, 27, who trained in hotel management at the Glion Institute in Montreux, Switzerland.Since his arrival, a breath of fresh air has been blowing through the corridors of this 35-room establishment, which he has completely renovated. Room 303 boasts a large white terrace with panoramic views of the pine forest, the hills and the Mediterranean.Touches of Sixties St TropezWe have a view over the water to the private island of Île d'Or. The song of cicadas enters the room through the patio doors. The decor is simple and calming – with a queen size bed, a small desk in light-coloured wood and a basket chair. Decorative touches evoke the spirit of St Tropez in the Sixties – a retro mirror, plates made of rope hanging on the walls, a raffia lamp...The restaurant menu has also been revamped. Sitting looking out to sea, a few meters from the palm-lined swimming pool, you can savor a ceviche of sea bream à la provençale with cherry tomatoes and black olives for lunch, and local yellowtail for dinner. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the medieval village of Bormes-les-Mimosas.A short walk to AustraliaDown the boulevard that winds its way toward the historic center, Gonzalez Park is an exotic botanical enclave in the land of the mimosa – a 3,000 square meter garden containing nearly 500 Australian plant species, including some rare species with geographically confusing names, such as the Chilean coconut tree or the Lebanon cedar. Guided tours by a gardener are organized by the tourist office, from May to September.A church in full bloomThe church of Saint-Trophyme, built in the 18th century, sits among traditional pink and ochre tiled houses. From May to November, the bougainvilleas that bloom on its façade give it the appearance of a Greek chapel. Classified as a historical monument in 1973, it has welcomed several French presidents during services, including Georges Pompidou and his wife, Claude.An island viewFrom the Place de l'Isclou-d'Amour, the view of the sea and the island of Porquerolles is dazzling. With its octagonal fountain, planted in the middle of hibiscus and mimosas, it is the ideal place for a breather – in Provençal, ""isclou"" means ""island.""

"Glastonbury, the British town where druids commune with trees",Feature,"Near an old English abbey in ruins, a yew tree has stood the test of time, for over a thousand years. Sacred to the Celts, the yew is now a protected species in Great Britain. Majestic and imposing, this one has a trunk so thick that a gaping hole divides it from top to bottom. Its branches look like multiple twisted arms, as if ready scoop up the first passer-by. As we got closer, we were startled by a thud emanating from the tree. Moments later, a man emerged from the cavity of the giant conifer, looking sleepy. The wacky scene made the English druid Penny Billington smile: ""Ah yes, dozing off in the trees is not uncommon here! A lot of us share a very carnal relationship with the nature around us.""This is Glastonbury, a small town in the southwest of England, famous for its music festival, which attracts huge audiences every year. Hippies on their way back meander through the small stores of the main street that sell incense, precious stones, fantasy objects and esoteric books.""Glastonbury is sacred. When I first came here in the early 1970s, I was immediately drawn to the mystical force in the air,"" recalled the druid, wearing a big black hat and small glasses, walking stick in hand.This city in Somerset county is at the crossroads of various religions and spiritualities, from Christianity and paganism, to Druidism and witchcraft. Dion Fortune, occultist author and magician, used to call the town the ""English Jerusalem."" For many people, Glastonbury represents above all Avalon, the mythical island of Celtic tradition where the tomb of the legendary King Arthur is said to rest, not far from the 1000-year-old yew tree. Perched on Tor, a hill overlooking the town, the enigmatic St. Michael's Tower is a further source of local mythology. It is around this medieval monument that large druidic celebrations take place throughout the year. Officially recognized as a religion in Great Britain since 2010, the close-to-nature spiritual movement is currently experiencing a revival in Europe.Fifteen years ago, when it was time to retire from her career as an English teacher, Ms. Billington naturally moved to Glastonbury with her family. ""Free from my responsibilities, I was able to devote myself to my search for spirituality, and so I passed through the three stages of the druidic path, that of the bard, the ovate and finally the druid,"" said the woman who has since developed a close bond with trees.With its many groves blending into the urban landscape, Glastonbury looks like a forest town. But you have to get away from it, go all the way through the fields toward the nearby Tor hill to discover the magnificent Combe Hill Wood, populated by old oaks and majestic maples. It's where Ms. Billington comes to revive her druidic inspiration.""I have several tree friends there. I know them well. They recognize me too,"" the druid said. Treading the forest path, she greeted some alders, casually and loudly. ""It's known that the ancient druids had a deep love for nature, trees and plants. They paid heed to their teachings and secrets,"" she added. ""The forest was a place full of life and contemplation, where they practiced meditation and performed ceremonies and celebrations. With such a strong connection to the plant world, they were trailblazers.""In the darkness of the wood, the druid remained silent for a long while and slowed her pace. She listened to the birdsong, which was in full swing that morning. Ms. Billington then took a pink paper bag out of her pocket that we thought would be filled with candy. She pulled out raisins and small seeds: ""You should never come to the forest empty-handed. It's a way to show our gratitude."" A little further on, she sowed her offering at the foot of a beautiful oak tree. Ms. Billington caressed its bark, walked around its trunk while keeping a hand in contact with it and then leaned against the tree. ""Did you notice? The other trees circle around this oak,"" she pointed out. ""It's one of my favorite places.""It resembles the forest sanctuaries that Celtic druids created. ""They called them their sacred groves. In these circles of plants, one could find trees such as the alder, the yew, and also the birch, the oak, the hazel, the holly, the apple tree and the willow. Each of them has a precise meaning in druidic tradition. These groves played the role of temples or natural chapels of sorts; they were places of spiritual refuge,"" said Ms. Billington. She added that the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids (OBOD), of which she is a member, has launched programs to plant sacred groves throughout the world.The oak tree, which druids adore, remains the king of the forest. It is on its branches that the most precious mistletoe grows, the rare and mysterious plant attributed to have magical powers of protection and healing. Pliny the Elder, a Roman writer and naturalist of the first century AD, reports in his Natural History about a mistletoe-cutting ritual in sacred oak groves at the winter solstice, by a druid in white robes with a golden sickle. ""We keep this tradition alive. In my garden, mistletoe grows on a small apple tree. Its natural magic amazes me and I pluck it with great reverence; I know what's symbolic about it,"" said Ms. Billington.Not far from her ""friend"" the oak, the druid stopped to observe another tree trunk. It was dead and withered, but in the course of its final transformation, it had taken on a strangely animal form, that of a greyhound frozen on the run. Right behind, an old maple tree was moving in a frenzied motion. Yet on this sunny morning, no wind passed through Combe Hill Wood. We asked the druid about the ever-moving leafy tree. ""He just wants us to notice him. He's waving at us,"" she said with a knowing smile.Ms. Billington defends her habit of ""humanizing"" trees and also lends them a presence, a force of communication that is not visible to the naked eye. ""The druids have always considered them as living beings with a soul, whose energy could heal or transform humans. It's our society that has gradually moved away from nature. It's urgent for us to go back to druidic knowledge and recover this lost connection,"" she said.For her, connecting with the trees on a spiritual level is a long journey of sensory experiences. ""It's not something immediately palpable. You have to make your imagination work, dare to plunge into a state of semi-consciousness, be ready to receive the tree's energy and, to do that, you have to start a dialogue with it once it accepts you. A lot of training goes into it before you taste success,"" said the woman who regularly shares her practice with the uninitiated. At the end of this sensory and meditative journey in the forest, the druid even promises a reward: a meeting with a dryad, a nymph inherited from Greek mythology, a protector of the forests embodying the spirit of trees.Possibly hidden under the bark, dryads are shy creatures who rarely show themselves ""except to those who know how to see and hear them,"" the druid mischievously added. Sensing our disbelief, she starts off with more prosaic explanations: ""Interactions between humans and trees are common in the stories we tell our little ones. Besides, there are more forests than fairies in fairy tales; that's how important they are to our imagination. The dryads of Greek myths come from this dreamlike journey and they symbolize access to the trees' hidden knowledge.""

Icelanders' reforestation efforts paint volcanic lava green,Feature,"Route One which runs from Reykjavik to the South of Iceland is a journey like no other. It's a succession of geothermal vents, lava deserts, glaciers and volcanoes which form a lunar-like landscape. It is home to some of the island's most famous volcanoes, such as Eyjafjallajökull, whose eruption in 2010 blocked a part of European airspace. The slightest flutters from its neighbor Hekla, one of the country's most active volcanoes, are also closely monitored.Over time, their ancient flow of lava has been covered by lichens and mosses, their intense green subdued by the purple of the Nootka lupine flowers. Fighting against the wind, elegant terns fly over the road at full speed. The highlight of the show are the sumptuous waterfalls rising from the volcanic heights, reinforcing the image of picture postcard.But another guest plays along with this Icelandic road trip. Nestling in the valleys at the foot of the glaciers, are small tree-filled spaces known as ""groves"" or ""forests."" They seem so rare and so fragile in this volcanic desert environment that you could almost say they were strewn here and there by mistake. On this southern part of Route One, around the Systrafoss waterfall, the village of Kirkjubæjarklaustur houses a small forest with the tallest trees in Iceland. Sitka spruces measure about 30 meters in height.Elín Anna Valdimarsdóttir lives right next to these tall trees, in the oldest house in the village, built in 1885. Every day she strides athletically along the steep paths of the forest which clings to the cliffside. ""My father was a farmer and was a part of the small community that planted these spruce trees in 1949,"" she said, emotionally. Over succulent smoked trout and homemade whipped cream, she proudly showed the old, yellowed family photos.Born in 1952, Ms. Valdimarsdóttir grew up with these trees. ""Well, they grew a little better than I did!"" she said, mocking her small stature. ""Icelandic forests are 'human' forests, in the sense that they are filled with the memory of those who planted them. They are not abandoned or disembodied spaces. Over time, they have become places of deep social significance,"" said Elisabeth Bernard, a young French anthropologist who works in the forestry sector in Iceland.First discovered by Viking expeditions, the island saw a population of Norwegian settlers take root for the first time on its territory between the years 870 and 930. At that time, forests occupied between 25 and 40% of Iceland. There were birches, willows, and in smaller numbers, rowan and aspen. But the intensive agricultural activities, and in particular the grazing of sheep, led to many wooded areas being destroyed. Later, the forests were used to provide firewood and to make charcoal. Icelandic trees, already put to the test by volcanic activity and harsh climate, were no longer able to regenerate. ""Deforestation had been so huge, over the past few millennia, that only 0.5% of Iceland's territory was covered by forests at the beginning of the 20th century,"" said Ms. Bernard.However, rare native birch forests have managed to survive over the centuries in several places on the island. Drumbabót, a site discovered in 2003 in the south of the country, is living proof of this. ""Following a flood, a forest of fossilized birch trees resurfaced here, and the rings of the trees [their growth rings] have allowed us to verify their long history, which dates back even further than the arrival of the first settlers,"" said Thorsteinn Jónsson, with a pipe in his mouth.He is one of the owners of the land on which Drumbabót is located. To get there, he needs to cross a river with his powerful 4X4, that allows access to this lunar landscape, hidden from tourists and not mentioned in guidebooks. There are tree stumps leaning at the same angle, buried for centuries under layers of sediment following a devastating glacial flood, around the years 822 or 823.At the beginning of the 20th century, finding their destroyed forests became an obsession for a small community of Icelanders. In 1907, the Icelandic Forestry Service (Skógræktin) was officially established. ""Across the island, voluntary forestry organizations were also formed during the same period. An umbrella organization, Skógræktarfélag Íslands, has represented them at the national level since 1930,"" Ms. Bernard said. She works in Reykjavik for this NGO, which has 7,500 members, or 2% of the Icelandic population.At the dawn of the 1950s, the first large-scale tree plantations began, with the native birch on top of the list. At the same time, imported Alaskan lupine came to play a valuable role in enriching the nutrient-poor and eroded Icelandic soil. But the species proved invasive. ""We have tried to find solutions to make our land green. We have diversified the tree species planted, and tried to work on multiple ways to help them grow better. It hasn't always worked, but we've gained experience,"" said Aðalsteinn Sigurgeirsson, deputy director of the Icelandic Forestry Service, while he inspected poplar cuttings in the Thjórsárdalur valley in southern Iceland.Sitting with his cup of coffee in a small wooden house belonging to Skógræktin, the expert admitted to feeling the soul of Elzéard Bouffier, ""in the face of this Icelandic landscape sometimes resistant to reforestation."" In the story of the lone shepherd written by Jean Giono, the character planted thousands of trees for years, in an arid region high up in Provence. Eventually, it gave rise to a forest and life all around it.With 2% of the island's current surface (re) forested, the work of Icelanders is beginning to pay off. By the year 2100, it is hoped that this level of coverage will reach 12%. Global warming and the trees' natural removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) has warded off any remaining reservations about this ""forced"" transformation of the Icelandic landscape.But perhaps the ultimate initiative is that of 30-year-old Daði Ólafsson on the Vestmann Islands, an archipelago popular with tourists, which is a 40-minute ferry ride off the coast of southern Ireland. There, he manages the amazing 28-hectare site called Hraunskógur, where young trees grow hidden in the cooled lava fields of the Eldfell volcano. ""Since 1999, we have been planting poplars, Sitka and Engelmann spruces and Alaskan willows,"" he said. The mixture of this black petrified lava, the green shades of the plantation and the Eldfell crater's red rock, lost in the clouds in the background, creates a breathtaking panorama.When this volcano erupted in 1973, it led to more than 5,000 people being evacuated. To save their island and its fishing port, the inhabitants tried to cool and deflect the lava by pouring tons of seawater at the tip of the flow. They succeeded. It is perhaps this resilience in the face of the violence of the elements that explains the courage and obstinacy of the Icelanders to revive their lost forests. Even in the middle of lava fields.",Travel,route one runs reykjavik south iceland journey like succession geothermal vents lava deserts glaciers volcanoes form lunar like landscape home islands famous

Seaside weekends in France to make summer last a little longer,"    Vacations may already feel like a long time ago, but from Marseille to Saint-Malo, there is still a whiff of summer in the air. ","Strolls to the lighthouse, one last swim in a heavenly cove, impressive sculptures on the beach, fresh salads... summer doesn't have to be over just yet.Right in the center of Marseille, on the Cours Honoré-d'Estienne-d'Orves, you will find the Grandes Halles du Vieux-Port, which opened on July 15 this year. This cheerful market, where you can sample food on the spot, has the feel of a small village. From Coquillages Claude, a shellfish shop, to the Rôtisserie de la Garde and its steaming-hot roast chickens, to La Vallée du Liban, which reminds of the city's neighbors across the Mediterranean, these Grandes Halles are perfect for an Airbnb weekend of conviviality and generosity.From Thursday through Saturday, the doors stay open until 2 am (and midnight on other days). It's the perfect opportunity to see the changing face of Marseille, as well as the MuCEM exhibition, ""Pharaoh Superstars."" This explores why some of Egypt's ancient masters were more popular than others, and has been met with well-deserved success – on until October 17.At Saint-Malo, no two Route du Rhum races (held every four years) are the same. In advance of the legendary race's next start on November 6, the city and its port are already buzzing. The solo sailors, nicknamed the ""va-t-en-mer"" (""go to sea""), will have to reach Guadeloupe, 8,000 kilometers off the coast of Brittany, in an attempt to beat the record for the crossing. It currently stands at seven days, 14 hours, 21 minutes and 47 seconds, set by Francis Joyon in 2018.From October 25, the village will spill out onto the quays of Saint-Malo, potentially attracting more than 2 million visitors. They will come to admire the exceptional sailors who are taking part in the race, but also their boats. New in 2022, the ""Ultims"" – the giants of the seas – will join the rest of the fleet in the Vauban and Duguay-Trouin basins, all along the historic quays of the race, at the foot of Intra-Muros (the old town) and the Palais du Grand Large.It is a port without the sea – almost. This is the origin of the River Auray, a narrow, elongated and deep ria, which follows the rhythm of the Golfe du Morbihan's tides in Brittany, where its water flows. Located on the eastern bank of the river, Saint-Goustan is an old trading port built in the 17th century, which used to ship cereals and textiles. Today it is a small marina with its own unique charm. Benjamin Franklin made a stopover there in 1776, and a quay was named after him. While Saint Goustan is the patron saint of sailors and fishermen, you don't need to be a sailor to explore – and what's more, this can easily be done on foot. After tasting oysters in the harbor, you can set sail on the Indomptable. Aboard this training boat, you can take part in the maneuvers and feel a little like a sailor.",Travel,strolls lighthouse one last swim heavenly cove impressive sculptures beach fresh salads summer doesnt yet right center marseille cours honor destienne dorves find grandes halles vieux port opened july year cheerful market sample food spot feel small village coquillages claude shellfish shop tisserie garde steaming hot roast chickens vall liban reminds citys neighbors across mediterranean grandes halles perfect airbnb weekend conviviality generosity thursday saturday doors stay open midnight days perfect opportunity see changing face marseille well mucem exhibition pharaoh superstars explores egypts ancient masters popular others met well deserved success october saint malo two route rhum races held every four years advance legendary races next start november city port already buzzing solo sailors nicknamed mer sea reach guadeloupe kilometers coast brittany attempt beat record crossing currently stands seven days hours minutes seconds set francis joyon october village spill onto quays saint malo potentially attracting million visitors come admire exceptional sailors taking part race also boats new ultims giants seas join rest fleet vauban duguay trouin basins along historic quays race foot intra muros old town palais grand large port without sea almost origin river auray narrow elongated deep ria follows rhythm golfe morbihans tides brittany water flows located eastern bank river saint goustan old trading port built century used ship cereals textiles today small marina unique charm benjamin franklin made stopover quay named saint goustan patron saint sailors fishermen dont need sailor explore whats easily done foot tasting oysters harbor set sail indomptable aboard training boat take part maneuvers feel little like sailor,stroll lighthous one last swim heavenli cove impress sculptur beach fresh salad summer doesnt yet right center marseil cour honor destienn dorv find grand hall vieux port open juli year cheer market sampl food spot feel small villag coquillag claud shellfish shop tisseri gard steam hot roast chicken vall liban remind citi neighbor across mediterranean grand hall perfect airbnb weekend convivi generos thursday saturday door stay open midnight day perfect opportun see chang face marseil well mucem exhibit pharaoh superstar explor egypt ancient master popular other met well deserv success octob saint malo two rout rhum race held everi four year advanc legendari race next start novemb citi port alreadi buzz solo sailor nicknam mer sea reach guadeloup kilomet coast brittani attempt beat record cross current stand seven day hour minut second set franci joyon octob villag spill onto quay saint malo potenti attract million visitor come admir except sailor take part race also boat new ultim giant sea join rest fleet vauban duguay trouin basin along histor quay race foot intra muro old town palai grand larg port without sea almost origin river auray narrow elong deep ria follow rhythm golf morbihan tide brittani water flow locat eastern bank river saint goustan old trade port built centuri use ship cereal textil today small marina uniqu charm benjamin franklin made stopov quay name saint goustan patron saint sailor fishermen dont need sailor explor what easili done foot tast oyster harbor set sail indompt aboard train boat take part maneuv feel littl like sailor
Discover Berlin: 'Le Monde' shares its top 20 addresses,Feature,"From swimming in a neo-Renaissance-style pool to flying kites in a disused airport to testing beer sorbet, here's how to be immersed in Berlin.Oderberger HotelIn the Prenzlauer Berg district, the sumptuous 1902 neo-Renaissance-style building has a swimming pool at its center. It was abandoned for 20 years before being transformed into a 70-room hotel complex that opened in 2016. With spacious and comfortable rooms, a top-notch breakfast, access to the pool and sauna and a cocktail bar with a terrace overlooking a lively street sheltered by plane trees, this is clearly the most charming hotel in Berlin.Hotel MichelbergerIn the heart of the action in Kreuzberg, near the trendy bars and concert halls, the Michelberger Hotel is undoubtedly the best value in the city. The rooms are simple but bright, tastefully decorated and enlivened with charming details (a few vintage books, almond or lavender-scented soaps). Whether in the bar, the coffee shop, the restaurant or the library, the same chic but modest, trendy but welcoming atmosphere prevails. Just like in the city.Rocket + BasilThis brand-new restaurant is an oasis in the gastronomic desert of Potsdamer Platz. Two German-Iranian sisters who grew up in Australia successfully mix their influences. But they always rely on fresh and seasonal products: cauliflower soup with saffron, abundant vegetarian salads (bean hummus, lemon zest, grated beet, cinnamon-roasted sweet potato, mixed seeds and nuts, tamarind vinaigrette), cardamom and rose roll cake and the list goes on. The whole menu is very appealing. The terrace is pleasant and the prices are as sweet as the dishes.Gelateria Mos EisleyAre you more of a Baden-Württemberg beer sorbet? Or blood orange and dulce de leche ice cream? Or would you prefer tonka bean? All of Mos Eisley's flavors are intriguing and appealing. Rest assured, the classics (stracciatella, vanilla, etc.) are also there. In every case, the ice cream is homemade with organic ingredients and without additives or coloring. The cones are vegan and delicious. Of course, in this small shop ideally located three minutes from Tempelhof, the line can be long.Five ElephantBerlin's best coffee roaster, located in a quiet corner of Kreuzberg since 2010, has opened a branch in one of Mitte's busiest streets. The café has adapted to the neighborhood: The tasty pastries (cheesecake tea cake, or ""whoopie pie"" – two disks with a butter and powdered sugar filling) are displayed on a long, chic terrazzo counter.

Germany to introduce €49 nationwide transport pass,    The €49 ($48.50) transport ticket follows the successful €9 summer ticket the country implemented from June to August. ,"German officials cleared the way on Wednesday, November 4, for a public transport pass costing €49 ($48.50) per month that will be valid nationwide, a long-term follow-up to a super-cheap ticket that was available for three months this summer and proved wildly popular.Transport Minister Volker Wissing said representatives of the federal government and Germany's 16 states resolved financing questions at a meeting in Berlin. He said the new ""Deutschlandticket,"" or ""Germany ticket,"" will be introduced ""as quickly as technically possible,"" hopefully at the beginning of 2023.In June, July and August, Germany sold a ""9-euro ticket"" enabling people to use regional train, bus and tram networks across the country for only €9 a month. It was part of efforts to help combat inflation stoked by Russia's war in Ukraine, as well as encouraging people to switch to environmentally friendly public transport and reduce gasoline use.There were widespread calls for some kind of successor at a more sustainable cost. A major attraction was its validity on all of Germany's regional transport networks, each of which has myriad fare options that can be hard to navigate.The aim is for the new ticket to be paperless and available for a single month or as a rolling pass. Like its predecessor, it won’t be valid for intercity trains – though, with creativity and plenty of patience, it's possible to make long-distance journeys using regional trains.Germany’s federal government offered to subsidize the new ticket with €1.5 billion annually; states several weeks ago expressed a willingness to do the same, pending an agreement on federal funding for regional train services.Under Wednesday's agreement, that funding is being increased by €1 billion this year and will grow by 3% per year thereafter, Mr. Wissing said. That was short of multiple states' original ask. Hendrik Wuest, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, said it was the ""absolute minimum"" needed to keep up current services and some of his colleagues were even more critical.",Travel,german officials cleared way wednesday november public transport pass costing per month valid nationwide long term follow super cheap ticket available three months summer proved wildly popular transport minister volker wissing said representatives federal government germanys states resolved financing questions meeting berlin said new deutschlandticket germany ticket introduced quickly technically possible hopefully beginning june july august germany sold euro ticket enabling people use regional train bus tram networks across country month part efforts help combat inflation stoked russias war ukraine well encouraging people switch environmentally friendly public transport reduce gasoline use widespread calls kind successor sustainable cost major attraction validity germanys regional transport networks myriad fare options hard navigate aim new ticket paperless available single month rolling pass like predecessor valid intercity trains though creativity plenty patience possible make long distance journeys using regional trains germany federal government offered subsidize new ticket billion annually states several weeks ago expressed willingness pending agreement federal funding regional train services wednesdays agreement funding increased billion year grow per year thereafter wissing said short multiple states original ask hendrik wuest governor north rhine westphalia state said absolute minimum needed keep current services colleagues even critical,german offici clear way wednesday novemb public transport pass cost per month valid nationwid long term follow super cheap ticket avail three month summer prove wildli popular transport minist volker wiss said repres feder govern germani state resolv financ question meet berlin said new deutschlandticket germani ticket introduc quickli technic possibl hope begin june juli august germani sold euro ticket enabl peopl use region train bu tram network across countri month part effort help combat inflat stoke russia war ukrain well encourag peopl switch environment friendli public transport reduc gasolin use widespread call kind successor sustain cost major attract valid germani region transport network myriad fare option hard navig aim new ticket paperless avail singl month roll pass like predecessor valid interc train though creativ plenti patienc possibl make long distanc journey use region train germani feder govern offer subsid new ticket billion annual state sever week ago express willing pend agreement feder fund region train servic wednesday agreement fund increas billion year grow per year thereaft wiss said short multipl state origin ask hendrik wuest governor north rhine westphalia state said absolut minimum need keep current servic colleagu even critic
A winter vacation in Paris? Our top hotel picks across the city,Selection,"For those visiting the capital as tourists or for Parisians who fancy a change of district for a night, here is Le Monde's selection of 20 attractive and welcoming establishments.Less than five minutes' walk from the Comédie-Française, and just a little more from the Louvre Museum, the Hôtel Thérèse is housed in an 18th-century building on Rue Thérèse, named after Marie-Thérèse of Austria. Visitors dive into another era when they arrive. The atmosphere is one of muted charm, from the very long sofa in shades of beige streaked with light brown lines to the monumental carpet created to fit around the two pillars of the large living room, spiced with the blue of the armchairs and the green of the doors. In the 40 rooms – from 10 to 28 square meters – industrial style intrudes here and there, in the white and black bathrooms, in a subtly chic, even neoclassical version, where the falsely stained carpet reminds us of an artist's studio floor enameled with paint chips. To appreciate the calm of the place, go to the small library-like lounge on the first floor for tea time, available to all guests between 4:00 and 6:00 pm. The effervescent Place de l'Opéra, nearby, can wait.Tinah for ""This is not a hotel,"" and indeed! It is a initially a little difficult to locate it while strolling on Rue Réaumur, in the Montorgueil district. Only a plaque, at number 108, an impressive building from the end of the 19th century, indicates that here, on the 6th floor is, or rather hides, a hotel that has all the airs of a (very large) Parisian apartment of which only the rooms and the spacious entrance (used as a common space and for serving breakfast) have been kept. No need to look for reception, there isn't one! A code, sent 24 hours before their arrival, is given to guests to enter the building and their room. There are seven rooms – one of which is on the landing – and they all have a view of the rooftops. From 16 to 21 square meters, they are decorated in soft colors (cream walls, heavy beige curtains, light wood headboards) and, like a Parisian apartment, the floor is covered with a magnificent parquet. It is possible to have the whole hotel to yourself, just to feel at home in the heart of Paris.At Maison Saintonge, a four-star establishment with a creamy white facade punctuated with green thanks to the ivy falling from each window, the tone is set as soon as you enter. Stone floor, white beams on the ceiling, herbarium of dried flowers in frames on the wall, counter, round table and wooden bistro chairs: You feel (almost) at home (in the country), with the clear touch of the Marion Collard design studio. The same atmosphere can be found in the 22 rooms and suites, with their cozy and relaxing atmosphere and colorful floral bedspreads. Do you feel a sudden urge to snack? Guests and locals alike will find something to their liking on the first floor, in the gigantic display cabinet – hunted down in a flea market like the rest of the fixtures and fittings – where black tapenade, mini breadsticks and artichoke hearts are on offer, which can be enjoyed comfortably on the rattan-like sofa in the tiny – but everything small is charming – inner courtyard.

Alaska presents a journey 'into the wild',Feature,"Utqiagvik city lies directly below the Arctic Circle, at the northernmost tip of Alaska. In late June, when the sun never sets, a handful of tourists gathered in the village square to share the whaling celebrations with the Inupiat inhabitants. The town has only one hotel called Top of the World; there is no road, and not a polar bear in sight on the melting ice pack – just a dive into the Arctic's icy waters (minus 4 degrees Celsius) as a rite of passage.Above all, there was a genuine feast celebrated with its indigenous inhabitants who shared their bowhead whale, hunted in the spring, in all its guises: raw, marinated and stewed. They danced and tossed each other into the air from a huge sealskin tarp. It was an extraordinarily authentic experience that does not smack of voyeurism or miserabilism, as is so often the case.The trip to Alaska, an American state three times the size of France, was an initiation into what is known the ""last frontier."" By comparison, Wyoming, with its bears and bison in Yellowstone Park, seems as tame as an English garden. This was an incursion ""into the wild"" following in the footsteps of Christopher McCandless, an ill-starred American, who at the age of 22, got lost when he forced his way some 40 kilometers through the mosquito-infested summer tundra.He had returned after a previous visit and met his death in 1992. Cut off at his back by the swollen glacial River Teklanika, he allegedly died from eating poisonous berries. His rusty green and white bus became a pilgrimage destination, so much so that a hiker drowned there in 2019. After which, in the spring of 2020, the vehicle was officially airlifted away and is now in the process of being turned into a museum exhibit at the University of Alaska Museum of the North, which admirably chronicles Alaska's history.Not far from the pilgrimage destination, hikers also make the trip to take in Mount Denali, North America's highest mountain peak (6 190 meters). But the vagaries of nature must be respected. In the Denali region, humans are barely tolerated. Private vehicles have been forbidden for decades. You can only travel on foot and camp, or by bus on an unpaved road.We crossed glacial rivers, swollen from melting glaciers, including the Teklanika, which had proved fatal to Chris McCandless. We walked the legendary hundred-kilometer trail to our destination and, on our arrival, we saw... a blanket of fog. Our guide then produced a photograph of the imposing Denali peak, which we had dreamed of seeing. But this is Alaska: Not everyone gets see Denali. Weather is always unpredictable and even more so, because the mountainside road, which collapsed in the summer of 2021, will remain closed until the National Park Service builds a bridge.a bridge.",Travel,utqiagvik city lies directly arctic circle northernmost tip alaska late june sun never sets handful tourists gathered village square share whaling celebrations inupiat inhabitants town one hotel called top world road polar bear sight melting ice pack dive arctics icy waters minus degrees celsius rite passage genuine feast celebrated indigenous inhabitants shared bowhead whale hunted spring guises raw marinated stewed danced tossed air huge sealskin tarp extraordinarily authentic experience smack voyeurism miserabilism often case trip alaska american state three times size france initiation known last frontier comparison wyoming bears bison yellowstone park seems tame english garden incursion wild following footsteps christopher mccandless ill starred american age got lost forced way kilometers mosquito infested summer tundra returned previous visit met death cut back swollen glacial river teklanika allegedly died eating poisonous berries rusty green white bus became pilgrimage destination much hiker drowned spring vehicle officially airlifted away process turned museum exhibit university alaska museum north admirably chronicles alaskas history far pilgrimage destination hikers also make trip take mount denali north americas highest mountain peak meters vagaries nature must respected denali region humans barely tolerated private vehicles forbidden decades travel foot camp bus unpaved road crossed glacial rivers swollen melting glaciers including teklanika proved fatal chris mccandless walked legendary hundred kilometer trail destination arrival saw blanket fog guide produced photograph imposing denali peak dreamed seeing alaska everyone gets see denali weather always unpredictable even mountainside road collapsed summer remain closed national park service builds bridge bridge,utqiagvik citi lie directli arctic circl northernmost tip alaska late june sun never set hand tourist gather villag squar share whale celebr inupiat inhabit town one hotel call top world road polar bear sight melt ice pack dive arctic ici water minu degre celsiu rite passag genuin feast celebr indigen inhabit share bowhead whale hunt spring guis raw marin stew danc toss air huge sealskin tarp extraordinarili authent experi smack voyeur miserabil often case trip alaska american state three time size franc initi known last frontier comparison wyom bear bison yellowston park seem tame english garden incurs wild follow footstep christoph mccandless ill star american age got lost forc way kilomet mosquito infest summer tundra return previou visit met death cut back swollen glacial river teklanika allegedli die eat poison berri rusti green white bu becam pilgrimag destin much hiker drown spring vehicl offici airlift away process turn museum exhibit univers alaska museum north admir chronicl alaska histori far pilgrimag destin hiker also make trip take mount denali north america highest mountain peak meter vagari natur must respect denali region human bare toler privat vehicl forbidden decad travel foot camp bu unpav road cross glacial river swollen melt glacier includ teklanika prove fatal chri mccandless walk legendari hundr kilomet trail destin arriv saw blanket fog guid produc photograph impos denali peak dream see alaska everyon get see denali weather alway unpredict even mountainsid road collaps summer remain close nation park servic build bridg bridg
Japanese treatments and marine spas: Five relaxing stays in France to melt your stress away,Selection,"The Yonaguni Spa opened in 2020 on the wine route in Alsace (Eastern France), in the Parc Hôtel Obernai, a family hotel founded in the 1950s. Measuring over 2,500 m2, the architects from Constans and Siegrist have designed a space that's both ultra-contemporary and soothing, sometimes full of mystery, often full of light. Inspired by a Japanese legend – the underwater archaeological remains of Yonaguni – the 10 pools are variations on the theme of the duality of stone and water. The Onsen space is soothing, the Geyser pool energizes, and the Typhoon stimulates. The hotel's outdoor spaces, from the panoramic sauna to the bamboo grove and the Japanese tea house, look out over Obernai, a charming little medieval town situated at the foot of Mount Sainte-Odile.The eco-lodge and Instants d'Absolu spa located on the shores of Lake Pecher, in the Cantal region of central France, offers stays that combine personal reflection and rejuvenation. Located in the middle of the Auvergne Volcanoes Regional Natural Park, the spa offers yoga sessions facing the lake before breakfast, and star and moon-gazing after sunset. The star-gazing spa combines a stainless steel bathtub and chromotherapy music, which plays on vibrations, with a personalized offer of massages and guided meditations. At an altitude of more than 1,100 meters, the climate is very distinct: The snow and ice of the harsh winters give way to flowering meadows in spring. The new ""Le Guetteur de Lune"" (""Moonwatcher"") bedroom has been extended with a beautiful wooden terrace reaching out towards the lake − connection with the sky guaranteed!In Bénodet, on the tip of Finistère in western France, you'll find Relais Thalasso, a resort completely renovated and redesigned in 2019. Facing the sea, yet greener and more natural than other Breton resorts, Bénodet is the ideal place to find balance. The ""Body and Soul Break"", new for 2023, is particularly aimed at active urbanites who want to take a moment to press pause.

A gourmet food hall revitalizes the Old Port of Marseille,    The Grandes Halles du Vieux-Port now boasts a market of artisans and producers specializing in Mediterranean gastronomy. ,"Over the years, the Cours d'Estienne-d'Orves, a vast pedestrian square in the heart of Marseille, had lost some of its luster, with afficionados preferring to frequent the bars and restaurants of nearby Rue Sainte, which climbs towards the Saint-Victor abbey. But three Marseillais ""minots"" as they are called, came up with the idea of a taste buds tingling gourmet food hall, in place of the old Buffalo Grill, which closed six years ago. ""Other than the Arnavaux market – a sort of Rungis – Marseille didn't have a covered food market,"" said Julien Fabre. ""For our perfect covered market, we called on our favorite artisans and put together a package offering delicacies from all over the Mediterranean.""Last summer, twelve food boutiques set up in a space of 2,000 square meters offering meals and snacks that can be eaten at the counter or on the spacious, open-air terrace. The decorator Olympe Zographos, inspired by the traditional pestle and mortar of Mediterranean cuisine, has dressed the area in Sardinian stone and olive wood or oak. In the morning, you can enjoy an espresso at the Bar Central, follozed by a plate of shawarma, hummus and tabouleh for lunch at La Vallée du Liban, which also operates on the Corniche Kennedy. La Serre, is a gourmet vegetarian boutique that offers, among other things, focaccia with dried tomato pesto and basil ricotta. The 500 Degrés pizzeria is extremely popular and boasts a huge, faceted oven made in Naples. And in Les Grandes Halles you will find tapas; a rotisserie; an Italian trattoria; a wine bar and ""we even have an oyster bar,"" the entrepreneur said. ""The oysters come from the Camargue or the Thau lagoon, which the oyster seller will open for you. And you can also order sea urchins or razor clams in parsley sauce.""And if the aromas in the Grandes Halles inspire you to cook at home, you only have to cross Rue Euthymènes overlooking the Old Port, to enter the market. ""Within the stone walls and 17th century structure of this former rope factory, you will find the best artisanal products: Coquillettes & Fusilli for fresh pasta; the Corsican grocer Ribella and the traiteur Raphael Chiappero, formerly a charcutier (pork specialist) in Aix-en-Provence.

Le Monde's top 20 destinations to visit in 2023,Selection,"Adorned with turquoise, emerald and sandy yellow, any picture of lake Bohinj is a postcard! In Slovenia, in the middle of the Julian Alps, this glacial lake offers landscapes that are constantly changing, from dawn to dusk, from winter to fall. It is necessary to escape into the surrounding hills, on foot, by bike or on horseback, to discover the breathtaking panoramic views before coming back down to bathe in the clear waters. The region confirms the strong identity of this small alpine country with the wooden agricultural dryers that Slovenia has made an emblem to the Triglav mountain, which, at 2,864 meters above sea level, was the highest point in former Yugoslavia. In the villages, beyond the baroque churches topped with onion-domed bell towers, impressive chalets welcome visitors as if they were at home.In Colombières-sur-Orb or in Mons-la-Trivalle, Mont Caroux is called ""the mountain of light."" It owes this unique, sparkling light to its rock, an ancient granite that has turned into gneiss composed of quartz crystals and mica sheets. It is a brightness that did not escape the Greek sailors: Mont Caroux provided excitement for them over 2,500 years ago. Its luster intrigues and fascinates those who walk on these paths or climb these cliffs. It is a mountain of wild stones, folds and needles – as its name indicates, Caroux meaning ""the stony one"" in Occitan – at the limit of the Cevennes and one hour away from the sea. In the same day, you can cross a pebbled, mineral landscape with the Espinouse mountains and the sea on the horizon, forests of scrubland, holm oaks and beeches and bathe in the pools of white and icy water of its gorges. It is a mysterious mountain, in the same way as time spent in these rough and secret landscapes.Welcome to the ""Hawaii of the North!"" The island of Tiree, the most remote of the Inner Hebrides, in Scotland, has earned this nickname because this 78-square-kilometer area at the end of the world, battered by the swell of the Atlantic Ocean, is a small paradise for surfers. The climate is rather mild and sunny, the white sand beaches endless and the Maze, a long bay near Kilkenneth, offers powerful waves as well as a point break worthy of a movie starring Keanu Reeves. Those who are reluctant to get on a surfboard can walk, cycle or ride through the large plains of short grass dotted with whitewashed or thatched houses.

Five winter walks by the sea in France,Selection,"Put on your boots and check your pedals, because walking or cycling in these touristy destinations in the summer is just as enjoyable in the winter, well wrapped up.How can you see what thousands of visitors never see, the other side of Mont-Saint-Michel? By putting on boots and walking around the village by the bay.Quicksand, water holes, changing weather, water releases... Because the risks are numerous and accidents frequent, it is better to opt for the two-hour guided walk. It will first take you close to the small Saint-Aubert chapel, which is reached after having waded through clay and climbed some rocks. Once on the beach, the guide will start walking through the water towards the open sea and the islet of Tombelaine (an ornithological reserve, where 130 species of birds live together).We follow him, incredulous of the (cold) water up to our knees. Then, after a few meters, we turn around to see the island in the light, spectacular. We can make out the sublime façade of the Merveille, the abbey's masterpiece, and the scriptorium, where the monks copied manuscripts. In the sunlight, the archangel St. Michel shines like never before. ""He also serves as a lightning rod for the village,"" says the guide, who explains the incredible landscape around us, as the rain suddenly falls: in the distance, the marshes and the sheep grazing in the salt meadows; at our feet, the current comes from all sides, for it is here that the rivers Couesnon, Sée and Sélune flow into the sea. ""Until the 1980s, we still fished up to a thousand salmon a year here!""Within a few minutes, a pink glow has lit up the sky, and the water has gone down. We walk through the sand slowly to avoid sinking. In the distance, we can already see the walkway, shuttle and the stream of tourists. So we stay a few moments more between earth and sea, in this breathtaking bay.At the foot of the Albères, the easternmost massif of the Pyrénées (southwestern France), the pretty town of Argelès-sur-Mer combines the charms of the big blue and the nearby mountains. We take the time to discover the red brick houses and river pebbles of this small town, the memorial dedicated to the Spanish Republican exiles of the Retirada, in 1939, before heading for the coast path. 32 kilometers that lead along the Vermeille coast to Cerbère, via Collioure.",Travel,put boots check pedals walking cycling touristy destinations summer enjoyable winter well wrapped see thousands visitors never see side mont saint michel putting boots walking around village bay quicksand water holes changing weather water releases risks numerous accidents frequent better opt two hour guided walk first take close small saint aubert chapel reached waded clay climbed rocks beach guide start walking water towards open sea islet tombelaine ornithological reserve species birds live together follow incredulous cold water knees meters turn around see island light spectacular make sublime ade merveille abbeys masterpiece scriptorium monks copied manuscripts sunlight archangel michel shines like never also serves lightning rod village says guide explains incredible landscape around rain suddenly falls distance marshes sheep grazing salt meadows feet current comes sides rivers couesnon lune flow sea still fished thousand salmon year within minutes pink glow lit sky water gone walk sand slowly avoid sinking distance already see walkway shuttle stream tourists stay moments earth sea breathtaking bay foot alb res easternmost massif pyr southwestern france pretty town argel sur mer combines charms big blue nearby mountains take time discover red brick houses river pebbles small town memorial dedicated spanish republican exiles retirada heading coast path kilometers lead along vermeille coast cerb via collioure,put boot check pedal walk cycl touristi destin summer enjoy winter well wrap see thousand visitor never see side mont saint michel put boot walk around villag bay quicksand water hole chang weather water releas risk numer accid frequent better opt two hour guid walk first take close small saint aubert chapel reach wade clay climb rock beach guid start walk water toward open sea islet tombelain ornitholog reserv speci bird live togeth follow incredul cold water knee meter turn around see island light spectacular make sublim ade merveil abbey masterpiec scriptorium monk copi manuscript sunlight archangel michel shine like never also serv lightn rod villag say guid explain incred landscap around rain suddenli fall distanc marsh sheep graze salt meadow feet current come side river couesnon lune flow sea still fish thousand salmon year within minut pink glow lit sky water gone walk sand slowli avoid sink distanc alreadi see walkway shuttl stream tourist stay moment earth sea breathtak bay foot alb re easternmost massif pyr southwestern franc pretti town argel sur mer combin charm big blue nearbi mountain take time discov red brick hous river pebbl small town memori dedic spanish republican exil retirada head coast path kilomet lead along vermeil coast cerb via colliour
Aix-en-Provence: Oscar Niemeyer's new French pavilion lives among the art at Château La Coste,"    The Brazilian architect's pavilion, with its dazzling clarity, is one of the most successful milestones of the Bouches-du-Rhône winery's artistic journey. ","Ten years after Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012) was laid to rest in the Sao Joao Batista Cemetery in Rio de Janeiro, he has resurfaced in France, in the grounds of Château La Coste (Bouches-du-Rhône), near Aix-en-Provence. Nestled among the whimsical topography of this Provençal luxury Eden, bordered on both sides by rows of vines, a new pavilion has just been inaugurated, bearing the name of the great Carioca architect. It was designed by his agency, under the leadership of his partner, Jair Valera, based on drawings he made in 2010. Mr. Niemeyer was 102 years old at the time.The building is intended to host exhibitions, as well as concerts and conferences. All curves and points, it is unveiled at the bend in the trail of art and architecture that has made the La Coste estate famous since Patrick McKillen shaped it to his own ideas. This Irish billionaire has enlisted the talents of the world's greatest artists and architects to develop a who's who of open-air museums. The collection has grown steadily since it opened to the public in 2011, at the same time as he was upscaling his wine production and building a luxury hotel on site.Works by Richard Serra, Louise Bourgeois, Alexander Calder, Sophie Calle, Ai Weiwei and Franz West are now in dialogue with two large metal wine cellars designed by Jean Nouvel, three enigmatic pavilions created by Tadao Ando, a ramshackle auditorium by Frank Gehry, a mini-museum dug into the ground by Renzo Piano and a high-tech pavilion dreamt up by Richard Rogers, whose firecracker-orange metal structure seems to be floating in the middle of the trees. Only Mr. Niemeyer was missing from the list.Approached by Mr. McKillen in 2010, the architect from Brasilia came up with his designs quickly after choosing the site. And then he died, in 2012. Although its origins were somewhat laborious (mainly, the estate's management tells us, due to scheduling incompatibilities between Château La Coste and the Brazilian agency), his pavilion already stands out as one of the major milestones of the tour. From the valley where it is located, it emerges like an apparition, an asymmetrical structure of brilliant clarity, that makes you lose your mind. On one side, there is a perfectly transparent comma, bordered by a glass façade. This is the exhibition space, from which the works (such as the wool sculptures by British artist Annie Morris in this inaugural season), the visitors and the landscape merge in a fascinating interplay of perspectives.",Travel,ten years oscar niemeyer laid rest sao joao batista cemetery rio janeiro resurfaced france grounds teau coste bouches near aix provence nestled among whimsical topography proven luxury eden bordered sides rows vines new pavilion inaugurated bearing name great carioca architect designed agency leadership partner jair valera based drawings made niemeyer years old time building intended host exhibitions well concerts conferences curves points unveiled bend trail art architecture made coste estate famous since patrick mckillen shaped ideas irish billionaire enlisted talents worlds greatest artists architects develop whos open air museums collection grown steadily since opened public time upscaling wine production building luxury hotel site works richard serra louise bourgeois alexander calder sophie calle weiwei franz west dialogue two large metal wine cellars designed jean nouvel three enigmatic pavilions created tadao ando ramshackle auditorium frank gehry mini museum dug ground renzo piano high tech pavilion dreamt richard rogers whose firecracker orange metal structure seems floating middle trees niemeyer missing list approached mckillen architect brasilia came designs quickly choosing site died although origins somewhat laborious mainly estates management tells due scheduling incompatibilities teau coste brazilian agency pavilion already stands one major milestones tour valley located emerges like apparition asymmetrical structure brilliant clarity makes lose mind one side perfectly transparent comma bordered glass ade exhibition space works wool sculptures british artist annie morris inaugural season visitors landscape merge fascinating interplay perspectives,ten year oscar niemey laid rest sao joao batista cemeteri rio janeiro resurfac franc ground teau cost bouch near aix provenc nestl among whimsic topographi proven luxuri eden border side row vine new pavilion inaugur bear name great carioca architect design agenc leadership partner jair valera base draw made niemey year old time build intend host exhibit well concert confer curv point unveil bend trail art architectur made cost estat famou sinc patrick mckillen shape idea irish billionair enlist talent world greatest artist architect develop who open air museum collect grown steadili sinc open public time upscal wine product build luxuri hotel site work richard serra louis bourgeoi alexand calder sophi call weiwei franz west dialogu two larg metal wine cellar design jean nouvel three enigmat pavilion creat tadao ando ramshackl auditorium frank gehri mini museum dug ground renzo piano high tech pavilion dreamt richard roger whose firecrack orang metal structur seem float middl tree niemey miss list approach mckillen architect brasilia came design quickli choos site die although origin somewhat labori mainli estat manag tell due schedul incompat teau cost brazilian agenc pavilion alreadi stand one major mileston tour valley locat emerg like apparit asymmetr structur brilliant clariti make lose mind one side perfectli transpar comma border glass ade exhibit space work wool sculptur british artist anni morri inaugur season visitor landscap merg fascin interplay perspect
New online agencies promote low-carbon travel,"    Across social media, a handful of travel sites are trying to rekindle a love for train travel among those who prefer to fly. ","One man related in detail how he had reached Marrakech (Morocco) by train and then by ferry from the city of Nantes, in the process spinning the slightest hiccup into an adventure. Others told of their getaway to Sicily, showing photos taken in the berths of a train from Rome to Catania.These sorts of traveler testimonies have, since March, been championed on new travel-related websites across social media. The aim is to inspire and revive the ""impulse"" to travel by rail among those who have abandoned it in favor of the airplane. ""We didn't expect that the project would generate this much interest,"" said Chiara Pellas, 26, one of the co-founders of the site Mollow.Launched in March, the website attracted more than 60,000 visitors in a single month and has seen its community grow. ""There are more people who are willing than are needed,"" said Clémence Martin, who is among those interested in the concept and who noted ""the true eco-friendly resonance"" of a project whose purpose is to avoid 1 million tons of CO2 emissions within five years.Created in the wake of this venture, and following the same model, Hourrail! has also aroused significant curiosity, drawing more than 220,000 page views in a month and a half. ""On average, out of every 100 people who consult our site, eight will click on a link to buy a ticket,"" said Benjamin Martinie, 32, one of the creators.""This type of initiative essentially fulfills a demand from the generations born after the year 2000,"" said Jean-Pierre Mas, president of Entreprises du voyage (""Travel companies"" union). ""Behaviors are starting to change among the millennials. Some of them are demonstrating an inclination toward restraint and even avoidance when it comes to air travel,"" he said.Nonetheless, these inroads have still appeared to be tenuous in light of the current recovery in air travel, fueled by a desire to dispel the effects of Covid-19 lockdowns. According to the Business Travel Observatory, bookings for the period from May 1 to June 1 were up 42% on medium-haul and 48% on long-haul flights compared to the same period in 2022.Of course, many booking sites have existed for years. Among the best-known are SNCF Connect, Trainline, Kombo and Omio. And the InterRail pass, which allows its holder to travel on the European rail network (from four days to three months).Newcomers in the travel industry want to take things further, by suggesting itineraries tested out by travelers or taken, as Mollow has done, from the recent guide by NGO Greenpeace which suggests 41 ideas for eco-friendly trips throughout Europe. To ""change the paradigm,"" a traveler selects a trip according to the time they have and not the chosen destination, with price estimations, booking links for each step, comments on comfort, and the corresponding carbon footprint.",Travel,one man related detail reached marrakech morocco train ferry city nantes process spinning slightest hiccup adventure others told getaway sicily showing photos taken berths train rome catania sorts traveler testimonies since march championed new travel related websites across social media aim inspire revive impulse travel rail among abandoned favor airplane didnt expect project would generate much interest said chiara pellas one founders site mollow launched march website attracted visitors single month seen community grow people willing needed said mence martin among interested concept noted true eco friendly resonance project whose purpose avoid million tons emissions within five years created wake venture following model hourrail also aroused significant curiosity drawing page views month half average every people consult site eight click link buy ticket said benjamin martinie one creators type initiative essentially fulfills demand generations born year said jean pierre mas president entreprises voyage travel companies union behaviors starting change among millennials demonstrating inclination toward restraint even avoidance comes air travel said nonetheless inroads still appeared tenuous light current recovery air travel fueled desire dispel effects covid lockdowns according business travel observatory bookings period may june medium haul long haul flights compared period course many booking sites existed years among best known sncf connect trainline kombo omio interrail pass allows holder travel european rail network four days three months newcomers travel industry want take things suggesting itineraries tested travelers taken mollow done recent guide ngo greenpeace suggests ideas eco friendly trips throughout europe change paradigm traveler selects trip according time chosen destination price estimations booking links step comments comfort corresponding carbon footprint,one man relat detail reach marrakech morocco train ferri citi nant process spin slightest hiccup adventur other told getaway sicili show photo taken berth train rome catania sort travel testimoni sinc march champion new travel relat websit across social media aim inspir reviv impuls travel rail among abandon favor airplan didnt expect project would gener much interest said chiara pella one founder site mollow launch march websit attract visitor singl month seen commun grow peopl will need said menc martin among interest concept note true eco friendli reson project whose purpos avoid million ton emiss within five year creat wake ventur follow model hourrail also arous signific curios draw page view month half averag everi peopl consult site eight click link buy ticket said benjamin martini one creator type initi essenti fulfil demand gener born year said jean pierr ma presid entrepris voyag travel compani union behavior start chang among millenni demonstr inclin toward restraint even avoid come air travel said nonetheless inroad still appear tenuou light current recoveri air travel fuel desir dispel effect covid lockdown accord busi travel observatori book period may june medium haul long haul flight compar period cours mani book site exist year among best known sncf connect trainlin kombo omio interrail pass allow holder travel european rail network four day three month newcom travel industri want take thing suggest itinerari test travel taken mollow done recent guid ngo greenpeac suggest idea eco friendli trip throughout europ chang paradigm travel select trip accord time chosen destin price estim book link step comment comfort correspond carbon footprint
Paris Air Show highlights search for more fuel-efficient aircraft,"    Before the arrival of carbon-neutral aircraft planned for 2050 at best, manufacturers are working on more frugal designs. Several concepts are being studied, from flying wings to biomimicry. ","The aircraft of the future, expected at best for the mid-2030s, is not just a technological and industrial challenge. It is also a political instrument for the entire industry. Planned to be carbon-neutral by 2050, especially if powered by hydrogen, it also has the task of greenwashing an industry criticized by environmentalists for its impact on the climate. Even though air transport accounts for less than 5% of the world's CO2 emissions, it is the sector that is singled out for criticism as a symbol of practices that should no longer exist.The problem is, the aircraft of the future isn't close to taking off soon. But with the prospect of aircraft powered by hydrogen engines that will emit only water vapor into the atmosphere, manufacturers such as Airbus, Boeing and Safran are hoping to make future passengers dream, so as to leave environmental concerns at bay for now.To produce this type of aircraft, Airbus intends to proceed in stages. First, it will build what it calls ""an ultra-economical aircraft,"" said Alain De Zotti, head of aircraft architecture and integration at Airbus. He wants the next aircraft to ""be a quantum leap in terms of efficiency,"" in particular, ""in terms of fuel consumption."" He added that this means ""using less carbon-intensive fuels,"" such as the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). These fuels are virtually impossible to find today and are six to seven times more expensive than kerosene.Still at the drawing board stage, Airbus is ""working on three major families of improvements"" for future aircraft, ""aerodynamic efficiency, low-carbon energies and improved air traffic flow."" Tomorrow's aircraft will be equipped with ""wider-span composite wings"" to improve airflow, lift and fuel efficiency. One of these aircraft will be equipped with wings so large that, on the ground, they will have to fold up to allow the aircraft to park at the airport.In the future, wings will not only be longer, but they will also have ""variable geometry"", said De Zotti.

Paris airport pandemonium after bag handler breaks,    A breakdown in luggage-sorting equipment at Orly airport meant many flights left late and without the luggage of their passengers on board. ,"With just one year to go before Paris hosts the Olympic Games one of the city's airports suffered an unprecedented breakdown on Thursday, August 3, that led to a mountain of luggage piling up and delayed flights.A breakdown in the luggage-sorting equipment at terminal four of Orly airport meant that baggage had to be handled by hand. That resulted in many flights leaving late and without the luggage of their passengers on board, according to the airport operator and airlines.The breakdown lasted from the start of operations in the morning until shortly before 7:00 pm.According to Marc Rochet, head of the French Bee and Air Caraibes airlines using the affected terminal, flights took off with delays between one and three hours – and without luggage that had been checked in. ""We didn't have another option, otherwise the whole system would be blocked,"" he told Agence France-Presse (AFP). Passengers' luggage would be flown onto them on the following flights.Airport operator ADP estimated 10,000 passengers on 40 flights were affected, but said that the reason for the breakdown had not been determined. The luggage in the terminal will be transferred to a secure hangar and then put on following flights. ADP tried to minimize the disruption by having planes use other terminals at Orly or use Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.Junior transport minister Clement Beaune called the situation ""unacceptable,"" coming just weeks after the government made a series of proposals to improve the quality of service ahead of the Olympic Games next year. ""This is exactly the type of concrete things that we need to watch,"" said Beaune.

Five series that make you want to travel,Selection,"Watching a series can transport you far away: to Hawaii with The White Lotus or, a bit closer to home, to the snowy slopes of Haute-Savoie, following the footprints left in the snow by Piste Noire.When season 1 of The White Lotus (OCS) came out in 2021, the series immediately seemed like a postcard for Hawaii, and in particular for the Four Seasons hotel in Maui, the main plot location. But with season 2, shot in 2022 in Taormina, Sicily, at the San Domenico Palace − a Four Seasons hotel again − The White Lotus took on another dimension. Sicily itself became a character. From Noto's baroque churches, in the southeast of the island, to the Villa Tasca in Palermo (a small 16th century palace with a huge garden and a dream pool, available on Airbnb at more than €5,000 a night for eight people), all the luxurious places that director Mike White points his camera at are being taken by storm. The essential role of the gay characters in the plot has even inspired the Italian LGBTQ tour operator Quiiky Tours to create a custom tour. Even at a minimum of €2,500 a night, the San Domenico Palace is sold out for a long time to come!Can a series put a country on our travel bucket lists? That's what Sexify has done for Poland. A hit with audiences, the story about a student who is forced to explore a compelling topic – female sexuality – shows off Warsaw like never before. The main plot location, the student residence where she lives, is in fact a youth hostel, Kapsula, where you can sleep for €35 in 2-cubic-meter boxes, Japanese style. Located in the district of Srodmiescie Polnocne, dominated by the imposing Palace of Culture and Science, it anchors the action in the center of the Polish capital. In the evening, the city seems to be at peak hype: Although the nightclubs are fictitious – Heaven is not a trendy club, but a gay sauna – you can discover addresses like the restaurant Zoni with its metallic decoration, or the Praga district, with its bars and tagged walls. Sexify makes you want to take a springtime trip to Poland.Peaky Blinders has become a phenomenon for Birmingham, the large industrial city in the Midlands, about 200 kilometers northwest of London. The series created by Steven Knight 10 years ago is set in the inter-war period. The thugs of the Peaky Blinders gang enact their reign of terror in the working class districts of Birmingham, then get rich, while facing down Irish nationalists and the Italian Mafia. Rackets, trafficking, illegal gambling: What an advertisement for a city! And yet, with the series' huge success, the desire to discover Birmingham, with its recognizable canals, has only grown. The Peaky Blinders walk – designed by some watchful fans – explores iconic filming locations and the historical sites where the real gang was active, from the Rainbow Pub to the Burlington Hotel. Don't forget to watch all six seasons before the trip!Borgen, the Danish series that tells the story of a female politician's rise to the position of prime minister, has put Copenhagen in a new light. Far from the eternal Little Mermaid, the capital's emblematic statue, the action focuses on places of power, such as Christiansborg Castle, the seat of the Danish Parliament. The good restaurants of the series are real addresses, such as the Kayak Bar in season 4 where you can eat seafood before going on the water, paddle in hand. Other sites are hybrid: The exterior of the Italian restaurant Il Buco appears in season 3 as the headquarters of the new party founded by Birgitte Nyborg, the heroine of the series. Finally, the very recent season 4 transports us to th capital of Greenland, Nuuk, where the representatives of the autonomous Danish territory are based, and also to the more picturesque town of Ilulissat, with its beautiful colored houses.One, then two, then three corpses at altitude. Piste Noire is a crime series on French TV channel France 2. It was filmed in Morzine in the Alps during the winter of 2021-2022, and although the series is quite classic in style, it is also formidably effective. Led by an amazing duo – the actors Constance Labbé and Thibault de Montalembert – it takes advantage of the vast landscapes of Haute-Savoie in eastern France, and in particular the Joux-Verte Pass, which climbs from Morzine to Avoriaz. But by tackling the subject of the environmental impact of ski resorts head-on – and the luxurious real estate projects that accompany them – Piste Noire also gives us a different view of the mountains. The François-Baud footbridge is recognizable at a key moment in the action, and the river, the Dranse, is omnipresent. In the ski scenes, the slopes of Avoriaz have been enhanced. The series uses the fictionalized resort as a window to a natural landscape beautifully filmed by drone.",Travel,watching series transport far away hawaii white lotus bit closer home snowy slopes

"In Wales and Ireland, Celtic walks from shore to shore",Feature,"Both sides of St. George's Channel in Wales and Ireland share a disturbingly similar landscape. This Celtic stronghold is crisscrossed by paths where you can find no fewer than 20 remarkable lighthouses, dozens of medieval castles and almost 200 beaches of every size. You can walk along it in seven stages, catching tiny glimpses of a journey between nature and history.The county of Pembrokeshire (its English name; Sir Benfro in Welsh) occupies Wales' western tip, more than 150 kilometers from the capital, Cardiff. Nowhere are the carboniferous limestone cliffs as wild as in the south of the county, specifically around Pembroke. Saint-Govan chapel's parking lot – a little tricky to find – forms the starting point for the most extraordinary walk by the sea.The chapel dates from the 13th century (some buildings date as far back as the 6th century) and has the unique feature of completely blocking the steep path that descends between two cliffs to the shore. The place is extraordinary. You have to enter the tiny building to come out on the other side, facing the elements. There is no beach here, but blocks of stone whitened with foam and headlands which are home to colonies of birds. After climbing back up and walking for an hour westward on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path – the Welsh version of this coastal route – we find the splendid Green Bridge of Wales, a low arch beaten by giant waves.The Pentre Ifan megalith, 20 kilometers from the Fishguard ferry port, is at first striking by its apparent lightness. How could this 16-tonne cover slab have survived the centuries supported by three vertical stones more than two meters above the ground? Built 3,500 years before our era, this burial chamber is not the only dolmen in the beautiful Preseli Hills, in the west of Pembrokeshire. In this walker's paradise, Neolithic menhirs and standing stones spring up from the peatland like mushrooms. It is now known that the Stonehenge's megalithic bluestones, in England, were taken from Waun Mawn's standing stones, near Pentre Ifan, despite it being 270 kilometers away.Among the many walking routes, the Golden Road is the one that most deserves a visit. Starting from the Foel Eryr site, this 12-kilometer path going from west to east follows a route already well-trodden by prehistoric man, as they came and went from England or Ireland. The walk is enchanting, taking in Bronze Age burial cairns, ancient fortifications, flocks of sheep and heather.The ferry from the post-Brexit United Kingdom to the Republic of Ireland, which uses the euro, goes from Fishguard, Wales, to Rosslare, County Wexford. This is the narrowest part of St. George's Channel, with no more than 100 kilometers separating the two shores. The crossing takes the Stena Line ferries three and a half hours. In fine weather, you can can catch a brief glimpse of the shoreline, and it has to be said that the one we left behind is remarkably similar to the one we meet on the other side: The same high cliffs alternating with the same fine sandy beaches, whether small or large.The abundance of small museums is no small part of this Celtic stroll's charm. In Waterford, Ireland, the medieval museum tracing the history of Ireland’s oldest town since the Vikings is fascinating. Among other things, it exhibits the precious pages of the ""Waterford Charter Roll,"" a charter written by the Anglo-Normans in 1373, which features a portrait of King Edward III of England, the oldest representation of an English sovereign painted in their lifetime.From the Arklow Maritime Museum in Ireland to the charming Dylan Thomas Boathouse museum in the Laugharne Estuary in Wales, these tiny places with limited resources are nevertheless full of surprises. In Arklow, between sailor's knots and displays dedicated to shipwrecks, we find the famous woolen turtleneck sweater worn by local sailors. Very warm, it is unique in its lack of seams. You can take a guide – ""Knitting Instructions for Arklow Gansey"" – to knit yourself one of these truly authentic sweaters at home.We get to Hook Lighthouse in Ireland via a tiny road, with the distinct feeling of going to the end of the world. Built in the 13th century, the lighthouse is quite simply the oldest one in the world still in operation. Its main tower has four-meter-thick walls, an admirable vaulted room and a 19th-century lantern with a splendid view. At the foot of the lighthouse, there is a small café-cum-pub, located in the former keeper's lodgings. The lighthouse is a very popular and unique observation point at sunset.St David's Cathedral was built on the site of the monastery established in the 6th century by the patron saint of Wales. In the Middle Ages, it enjoyed such prestige that two pilgrimages here were worth the same as one pilgrimage to Rome. This church is one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture in Britain. Perfectly proportioned, it stands at the end of the village in a small valley. Many of the numerous Anglo-Norman castles have similar such ruins, making a trip to Wales a treat for medieval heritage lovers. Like Carew or Laugharne, the defensive forts were often built on the edge of the estuaries they protected. Today, the estuaries' calm waters hold a mirror up to the ruins, reflecting their former glory.The Irish and Welsh coastlines are not all dominated by hostile cliffs. Like the Normandy valleys of France, hollows lead out onto beaches. The largest and most accessible ones are crowded in the summer, but it is the small, sometimes tiny ones that give these Celtic shores their character.The Irish example is Dollar Bay. This small protected cove, seven kilometers from Hook Lighthouse, appears enchanting as you approach it via a path through the fields. Do those who enjoy sunbathing on its golden sands know that they may be lying on treasure? It was here in 1765 that the sailors on the Earl of Sandwich, a ship that came from Tenerife in the Canary Islands, threw their captain overboard to seize the Spanish gold coins that he kept in his cabin. The mutineers were caught and publicly hanged, and left part of their booty on the beach, which has since been named after them.Surrounded by fields, Pwllgwaelod beach in Wales is even more rural than its Irish little sister. You can rent kayaks, or simply swim there. While the hamlet of just three houses has all the appearance of a postcard, it is also because it leads to Dinas Island farm – via the Pembrokeshire Coast Path – which welcomes campers a long way from anything. Welsh or Irish, these magnificently cut coasts have one thing in common: From isthmuses to peninsulas, they grant a thousand magnificent landscapes if you are willing to get a little lost on their roads and paths.",Travel,sides georges channel wales ireland share disturbingly similar landscape celtic stronghold crisscrossed paths find fewer remarkable lighthouses dozens medieval castles almost

UK flights delayed and canceled as a 'technical issue' hits air traffic control,    Flight control operator National Air Traffic Services said its automated systems had experienced an unexplained 'technical issue' on Monday. ,"Thousands of air travelers around the world faced delays on Monday, August 28, after Britain's air traffic control system was hit by a breakdown that slowed takeoffs and landings across the UK. Flight control operator National Air Traffic Services said its automated systems had experienced an unexplained ""technical issue"" on Monday, August 28,  the end of a holiday weekend for many in the UK and one of the busiest travel days of the year.Several hours after the problem was first reported, NATS said the outage was ""affecting our ability to automatically process flight plans. Until our engineers have resolved this, flight plans are being input manually which means we cannot process them at the same volume.""The service said it had ""applied traffic flow restrictions to maintain safety"" but that UK airspace remained open. It did not give an estimate of how long it would take to fix the problem, or what had caused it, but European air traffic authority Eurocontrol warned of ""very high"" delays because of the ""flight data processing system failure"" in the UK.Airports both inside and outside the UK told passengers to expect delays and cancellations. Passengers scheduled to fly to Britain from European airports said they were being told to expect delays of several hours or more.Heathrow, Europe's busiest air hub, said ""national airspace issues"" were causing disruption to flights, and advised passengers to check with their airline. Aviation analyst Alastair Rosenschein, a former BA pilot, said the air traffic system appeared to have suffered ""some kind of patchy failure as opposed to a total shutdown.""He told Sky News that ""the disruption will be quite severe at some airports"" and some UK-bound flights will likely have to land in other European countries in order to reduce the flow of inbound planes.",Travel,thousands air travelers around world faced delays monday august britains air traffic control system hit breakdown slowed takeoffs landings across flight control operator national air traffic services said automated systems experienced unexplained technical issue monday august end holiday weekend many one busiest travel days year several hours problem first reported nats said outage affecting ability automatically process flight plans engineers resolved flight plans input manually means process volume service said applied traffic flow restrictions maintain safety airspace remained open give estimate long would take fix problem caused european air traffic authority eurocontrol warned high delays flight data processing system failure airports inside outside told passengers expect delays cancellations passengers scheduled fly britain european airports said told expect delays several hours heathrow europes busiest air hub said national airspace issues causing disruption flights advised passengers check airline aviation analyst alastair rosenschein former pilot said air traffic system appeared suffered kind patchy failure opposed total shutdown told sky news disruption quite severe airports bound flights likely land european countries order reduce flow inbound planes,thousand air travel around world face delay monday august britain air traffic control system hit breakdown slow takeoff land across flight control oper nation air traffic servic said autom system experienc unexplain technic issu monday august end holiday weekend mani one busiest travel day year sever hour problem first report nat said outag affect abil automat process flight plan engin resolv flight plan input manual mean process volum servic said appli traffic flow restrict maintain safeti airspac remain open give estim long would take fix problem caus european air traffic author eurocontrol warn high delay flight data process system failur airport insid outsid told passeng expect delay cancel passeng schedul fli britain european airport said told expect delay sever hour heathrow europ busiest air hub said nation airspac issu caus disrupt flight advis passeng check airlin aviat analyst alastair rosenschein former pilot said air traffic system appear suffer kind patchi failur oppos total shutdown told sky news disrupt quit sever airport bound flight like land european countri order reduc flow inbound plane
2023: A new era for travel beckons,Editorial,"Is travel becoming a guilty pleasure? The climate crisis is prompting us to question our modes of consumption, leisure and escape even more. As early as 2020 in Le Monde's top travel destination list, we highlighted ten places you could reach without airplanes, encouraging our readers to discover closer to home. Since then, we have continued to evolve our approach to everyday travel, refocusing on the seemingly infinite beauty of France, promoting cycling, walking and train trips, and responding to the desire to get back to nature and disconnect.Once again this year, it seemed obvious to offer you a list of the best destinations in France (ten) and in Europe (five). But in order to travel ""responsibly,"" it is not enough to avoid flying. It is also essential to discover places that promote conscious travel. If the Lac du Bourget, in southeastern France, looks like a postcard with its turquoise waters surrounded by mountains, it's because people have been working for half a century to give this vulnerable environment back its oxygen and its fish. Behind the magnificent cultivation of olive trees, vines and almond trees on the terraces of La Balagne, Corsica's Garden of Eden, lies a fragile landscape to be preserved.An eternal dilemma arises: Should we reveal secret destinations or talk about those already popular? We chose... not to choose. Certainly, it is exhilarating to discover without the hordes of tourists the medieval charms of the Dropt valley, in southwestern France, to stroll along the maritime Flanders, from the river Aa to the other Sahara, or to take the wave on the island of Tiree, secret paradise for Scottish surfers. But geological splendors such as Meteora, the second most visited site in Greece after the Acropolis, are also worth a visit. It's just a matter of not playing Instagram tourists – staying long enough just to snap a photo – and taking the time to walk from Kalambaka to the incredible seven-century-old troglodyte monasteries.To dive into the clear waters of Lake Bohinj, the number one destination of the year, we advise avoiding the height of summer and making it a short stop for a few hours during a Slovenian road trip.

Apollo astronaut Thomas Mattingly dies at 87,    The American astronaut formerly part of the Apollo 13 mission played a vital role in ensuring the safe return of its crew through his ground control problem-solving efforts. ,"A NASA astronaut who was removed from the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission but helped bring its crew back home safely thanks to his problem-solving efforts from ground control has died at the age of 87. Thomas K. ""TK"" Mattingly passed away on October 31, the space agency said in a statement Thursday, November 2.His most dramatic role came when he was assigned as command module pilot for the Apollo 13 flight but was grounded 72 hours prior to launch due to exposure to rubella, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said. After an explosion crippled the spacecraft on its way to the Moon, Mattingly, who did not get sick, went to Mission Control and devised procedures to conserve power so the vehicle could successfully re-enter the atmosphere, ensuring astronauts James Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise survived. The mission was dramatized in the 1995 film Apollo 13 in which Mattingly was played by Gary Sinise.Mattingly began his career as a US Navy pilot before being selected to the astronaut class of 1966. He later took on the role of command module pilot on the Apollo 16 mission and was the spacecraft commander in two Space Shuttle missions.

France links 2024 Olympic smear campaign to Azerbaijan,"    According to a report by French government watchdog Viginum, a 'coordinated maneuver' by around 90 accounts with links to Azerbaijan shared 'visuals calling for a boycott of the 2024 Olympics' on July 26 and 27. ","Paris has linked Azerbaijani figures to a disinformation campaign aimed at tarnishing France's reputation as host of the 2024 Olympic Games, according to a report seen by Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Monday, November 13. France is pulling out all the stops to host the Olympic Games, which will take place from July 26 to August 11.According to a report from French state digital watchdog Viginum, seen by AFP and other media on Monday, an investigation was launched in late July after ""several visuals calling for a boycott of the 2024 Olympics"" were widely shared on X (formerly Twitter). The campaign featured images of riots, the city of Paris and also the logo of the Olympic Games, and involved three official X accounts of the games and two hashtags #PARIS2024 and #BOYCOTTPARIS2024, said Viginum.On July 26 and 27, more than 1,600 posts accompanied by these visuals or hashtags appeared on X. Around 90 accounts appear to be behind these posts ""suggesting artificial amplification,"" the report said. Viginum said that 40 of them were created in July 2023 and only published content calling for the boycott of the Paris Games.The probe revealed that of these 90 accounts, ""a significant proportion had at least one link to Azerbaijan"" such as a photo featuring the Azerbaijani flag, Azerbaijani locations, or excerpts from speeches of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. Misspelled place names – Bordo instead of Bordeaux or Monpelye instead of Montpellier – were another ""marker of inauthenticity,"" the report said.The watchdog has also identified an account at the origin of the online content targeting the Games. The account @MuxtarYev published 15 visuals calling for a boycott, which were then amplified by inauthentic accounts and picked up by X accounts linked to Azerbaijan – a pattern that ""reinforces the hypothesis of a coordinated maneuver,"" Viginum said. Created in June 2023, the @MuxtarYev account claims to be located in Azerbaijan.The name Muxtar Nagiyev and the account's profile photo coincide with the identity of the chairman of the Sabail district organization of the New Azerbaijan party, the ex-Soviet country's ruling party. According to the report, Azerbaijani national Orkhan Rzayev, who runs two companies including Mediamark Digital, could also be linked to the smear campaign.Diplomatic tensions have simmered between France and Azerbaijan, with the ex-Soviet country accusing Paris of supporting its arch-enemy Armenia and pursuing a policy of ""militarisation"" in the South Caucasus.",Pixels,paris linked azerbaijani figures disinformation campaign aimed tarnishing frances reputation host olym according report seen agence france presse afp monday november france pulling stops host olym take place july august according report french state digital watchdog viginum seen afp media monday investigation launched late july several visuals calling boycott olym widely shared formerly twitter campaign featured images riots city paris also logo olym involved three official accounts games two hashtags paris boycottparis said viginum july posts accompanied visuals hashtags appeared around accounts appear behind posts suggesting artificial amplification report said viginum said created july published content calling boycott paris games probe revealed accounts significant proportion least one link azerbaijan photo featuring azerbaijani flag azerbaijani locations excerpts speeches azerbaijani president ilham aliyev misspelled place names bordo instead bordeaux monpelye instead montpellier another marker inauthenticity report said watchdog also identified account origin online content targeting games account published visuals calling boycott amplified inauthentic accounts accounts linked azerbaijan pattern reinforces hypothesis coordinated maneuver viginum said created june account claims located azerbaijan name muxtar nagiyev accounts profile photo coincide identity chairman sabail district organization new azerbaijan party soviet countrys ruling party according report azerbaijani national orkhan rzayev runs two companies including mediamark digital could also linked smear campaign diplomatic tensions simmered france azerbaijan soviet country accusing paris supporting arch enemy armenia pursuing policy militarisation south caucasus,pari link azerbaijani figur disinform campaign aim tarnish franc reput host olym accord report seen agenc franc press afp monday novemb franc pull stop host olym take place juli august accord report french state digit watchdog viginum seen afp media monday investig launch late juli sever visual call boycott olym wide share formerli twitter campaign featur imag riot citi pari also logo olym involv three offici account game two hashtag pari boycottpari said viginum juli post accompani visual hashtag appear around account appear behind post suggest artifici amplif report said viginum said creat juli publish content call boycott pari game probe reveal account signific proport least one link azerbaijan photo featur azerbaijani flag azerbaijani locat excerpt speech azerbaijani presid ilham aliyev misspel place name bordo instead bordeaux monpely instead montpelli anoth marker inauthent report said watchdog also identifi account origin onlin content target game account publish visual call boycott amplifi inauthent account account link azerbaijan pattern reinforc hypothesi coordin maneuv viginum said creat june account claim locat azerbaijan name muxtar nagiyev account profil photo coincid ident chairman sabail district organ new azerbaijan parti soviet countri rule parti accord report azerbaijani nation orkhan rzayev run two compani includ mediamark digit could also link smear campaign diplomat tension simmer franc azerbaijan soviet countri accus pari support arch enemi armenia pursu polici militaris south caucasu
"Post-Brexit, migrant farm workers in the UK increasingly come from Asia",Feature,"He has just placed another crate of strawberries in the back of the van. Before setting off again to keep up the pace of work, he takes a minute to explain his situation. This young man comes from Kyrgyzstan, where he was the director of a water purification project for a major development bank. How did he end up picking berries in Herefordshire, in the West of England? ""Here I earn in a week what I used to earn in a month back home. I'm here for the money.""Along with her husband, Christine Snell owns some 160 hectares planted with strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blackcurrants. New faces have been arriving in their fields in recent years. With Brexit and the end of free movement for European workers, she has to recruit from further afield – much further afield. ""Now they come from the 'stan' countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan,"" she explained. Central Asia is replacing Central Europe as the source of the labor needed to pick 1,000 tonnes of strawberries and keep the packaging plant running.At the height of summer, she needs almost 300 people; in the depths of winter, around 40 is enough. Most live on site in mobile homes for up to six months, the duration of their visa. They receive minimum wage (£10.42, or €12.10, an hour), plus a bonus that can of an extra 50% or more for the most productive workers, depending on the quantity of fruit picked.In the fields, a subtle hierarchy of nationalities has now set in. At the top are the Europeans, who arrived before Brexit and have obtained settled status, which gives them the right to stay in the UK. Many, like Ion Avram, a Romanian who has been coming to Snell’s farm for 19 years, spend the winter in their country of origin and return every summer at harvest time. Below them in the pecking order are the newcomers. Most don't speak a word of English, leading to communication challenges. ""I speak a little Russian, they do too, and we manage to understand each other in that language,"" Avram explained. ""It's hard work, but I come back every year for the money,"" said this veterinarian by training, whose 6-year-old son is waiting for him to return to Romania.British agriculture is facing a severe labor shortage. ""Access to migrant labor has been crucial for filling labor gaps in the food supply chain but acquiring migrant labor has become increasingly challenging,"" warned John Shropshire, chairman of G's Fresh, a major agri-food group, in June in a report on the subject submitted to the British government. The UK, he points out, is not alone in this problem: ""Our international and European counterparts face similar obstacles as they expand their search for labor beyond local regions."" However, in addition to the UK’s 4% unemployment rate and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, which have caused many employees to distance themselves from work, ""reduced access to workers from the European Union [has] contributed to this problem,"" the report noted.",Global-issues,placed another crate strawberries back van setting keep pace work takes minute explain situation young man comes kyrgyzstan director water purification project major development bank end berries herefordshire west england earn week used earn month back home money along husband christine snell owns hectares planted strawberries raspberries blackberries blackcurrants new faces arriving fields recent years brexit end free movement european workers recruit afield much afield come stan countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan explained central asia replacing central europe source labor needed pick tonnes strawberries keep packaging plant running height summer needs almost people depths winter around enough live site mobile homes six months duration visa receive minimum wage hour plus bonus extra productive workers depending quantity fruit fields subtle hierarchy nationalities set top europeans arrived brexit obtained settled status gives right stay many like ion avram romanian coming snell farm years spend winter country origin return every summer harvest time pecking order newcomers dont speak word english leading communication challenges speak little russian manage understand language avram explained hard work come back every year money said veterinarian training whose year old son waiting return romania british agriculture facing severe labor shortage access migrant labor crucial filling labor gaps food supply chain acquiring migrant labor become increasingly challenging warned john shropshire chairman fresh major agri food group june report subject submitted british government points alone problem international european counterparts face similar obstacles expand search labor beyond local regions however addition unemployment rate effects covid pandemic caused many employees distance work reduced access workers european union contributed problem report noted,place anoth crate strawberri back van set keep pace work take minut explain situat young man come kyrgyzstan director water purif project major develop bank end berri herefordshir west england earn week use earn month back home money along husband christin snell own hectar plant strawberri raspberri blackberri blackcurr new face arriv field recent year brexit end free movement european worker recruit afield much afield come stan countri kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan explain central asia replac central europ sourc labor need pick tonn strawberri keep packag plant run height summer need almost peopl depth winter around enough live site mobil home six month durat visa receiv minimum wage hour plu bonu extra product worker depend quantiti fruit field subtl hierarchi nation set top european arriv brexit obtain settl statu give right stay mani like ion avram romanian come snell farm year spend winter countri origin return everi summer harvest time peck order newcom dont speak word english lead commun challeng speak littl russian manag understand languag avram explain hard work come back everi year money said veterinarian train whose year old son wait return romania british agricultur face sever labor shortag access migrant labor crucial fill labor gap food suppli chain acquir migrant labor becom increasingli challeng warn john shropshir chairman fresh major agri food group june report subject submit british govern point alon problem intern european counterpart face similar obstacl expand search labor beyond local region howev addit unemploy rate effect covid pandem caus mani employe distanc work reduc access worker european union contribut problem report note
Mafia boss and ruthless killer Matteo Messina Denaro dies aged 61,"    Suffering from incurable cancer, this Toto Riina devotee, directly implicated in dozens of murders, was arrested in Palermo in January after three decades on the run. His death at the age of 61 was announced on Monday. ","In the summer of 1993 and with the Italian police hot on his heels, a love letter from 30-year-old Matteo Messina Denaro signaled the start of his flight ""You'll hear about me, they'll paint me as a devil, but it'll all be lies,"" he wrote to his then-girlfriend Angela in farewell. Overnight, Sicily's most feared young mafia boss became a ghost.For the next 30 years, this brutal man with the reputation of a playboy would elude investigators with the same virtuosity as his favorite comic-book hero, Diabolik, who he took his nickname from. Italy knew him by the photograph on his wanted poster for murders, bombings, arms and drug trafficking: an angular face, shrouded in mystery, hidden behind smoked glasses. This was the face of a ruthless killer, who became the symbol of superlatitanti, the most elusive bosses.Suffering from cancer, 61-year-old Messina Denaro died in hospital, as reported by the ANSA agency on Monday, September 25. Several dozen police used to stand guard around the room of the former ""Godfather"" in the San Salvatore hospital in L'Aquila (Abruzzo).Eight months earlier, on January 16, it was precisely by following the trail of his colon tumor that investigators finally managed to arrest Italy's most notorious fugitive, while he was on his way to a medical consultation, under an assumed identity, at a clinic in Palermo. This ended the career of a man who had never before set foot in a prison cell, or even the dock in a court.Messina Denaro's criminal destiny was rooted in Castelvetrano, in the Sicilian province of Trapani, where he was born on April 26, 1962. Although the fourth of six siblings (and the second son), he grew up as an heir, programmed to succeed his father, Francesco, known as Don Ciccio. A simple farmer, according to his identity papers, ""Ciccio"" was in reality the mafia boss of this region of western Sicily. A silent man, he was allied to the Corleones, who became the new masters of the island in the early 1980s, at the cost of a bloodbath. At their head was Toto Riina, the ""capo dei capi,"" also nicknamed ""La Belva"" (""the beast"").It was the ""beast"" himself who mentored young Matteo and propelled him into the Cosa Nostra elite. Riina taught this promising boy, initially nicknamed ""U Seccu"" (""the skinny one"") because of his wiry figure, the art of scheming as well as express killings. Using a Walther P38, the ambitious young man proved his worth. He even exceeded his master's expectations, but also broke the rules of the old-school ""men of honor,"" who were generally discreet and rather austere. Messina Denaro was a gambler. He went to discos, drove a Porsche, paraded around in Versace suits, scarf around his neck, gold watch on his wrist.",Global-issues,summer italian police hot heels love letter year old matteo messina denaro signaled start flight youll hear theyll paint devil itll lies wrote girlfriend angela farewell overnight sicilys feared young mafia boss became ghost next years brutal man reputation playboy would elude investigators virtuosity favorite comic book hero diabolik took nickname italy knew photograph wanted poster murders bombings arms drug trafficking angular face shrouded mystery hidden behind smoked glasses face ruthless killer became symbol superlatitanti elusive bosses suffering cancer year old messina denaro died hospital reported ansa agency monday september several dozen police used stand guard around room former godfather san salvatore hospital laquila abruzzo eight months earlier january precisely following trail colon tumor investigators finally managed arrest italys notorious fugitive way medical consultation assumed identity clinic palermo ended career man never set foot prison cell even dock court messina denaros criminal destiny rooted castelvetrano sicilian province trapani born april although fourth six siblings second son grew heir programmed succeed father francesco known ciccio simple farmer according identity papers ciccio reality mafia boss region western sicily silent man allied corleones became new masters island early cost bloodbath head toto riina capo dei capi also nicknamed belva beast beast mentored young matteo propelled cosa nostra elite riina taught promising boy initially nicknamed seccu skinny one wiry figure art scheming well express killings using walther ambitious young man proved worth even exceeded masters expectations also broke rules old school men honor generally discreet rather austere messina denaro gambler went discos drove porsche paraded around versace suits scarf around neck gold watch wrist,summer italian polic hot heel love letter year old matteo messina denaro signal start flight youll hear theyll paint devil itll lie wrote girlfriend angela farewel overnight sicili fear young mafia boss becam ghost next year brutal man reput playboy would elud investig virtuos favorit comic book hero diabolik took nicknam itali knew photograph want poster murder bomb arm drug traffick angular face shroud mysteri hidden behind smoke glass face ruthless killer becam symbol superlatitanti elus boss suffer cancer year old messina denaro die hospit report ansa agenc monday septemb sever dozen polic use stand guard around room former godfath san salvator hospit laquila abruzzo eight month earlier januari precis follow trail colon tumor investig final manag arrest itali notori fugit way medic consult assum ident clinic palermo end career man never set foot prison cell even dock court messina denaro crimin destini root castelvetrano sicilian provinc trapani born april although fourth six sibl second son grew heir program succeed father francesco known ciccio simpl farmer accord ident paper ciccio realiti mafia boss region western sicili silent man alli corleon becam new master island earli cost bloodbath head toto riina capo dei capi also nicknam belva beast beast mentor young matteo propel cosa nostra elit riina taught promis boy initi nicknam seccu skinni one wiri figur art scheme well express kill use walther ambiti young man prove worth even exceed master expect also broke rule old school men honor gener discreet rather auster messina denaro gambler went disco drove porsch parad around versac suit scarf around neck gold watch wrist
Macron and Meloni meet in Rome amid tensions over migration,    The French leader was in Italy to attend former president Giorgio Napolitano's state funeral. A sharp rise in migrant landings to the Italian island of Lampedusa has reignited a bitter debate across the EU. ,"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni held talks on Tuesday, September 26, with French President Emmanuel Macron in Rome, against a backdrop of tensions between the two countries over migration.The French leader was in the Italian capital to attend the state funeral of former president Giorgio Napolitano, who died on Friday aged 98. A sharp rise in migrant landings to the Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month reignited a bitter debate across the EU over who takes responsibility for asylum seekers.There has been particularly heated rhetoric in France, where political parties in the country's hung parliament are wrangling over a draft law governing new arrivals.""We cannot leave the Italians alone,"" Macron said in a television interview on Sunday – an offer of help that Meloni immediately said she ""welcomed with great interest."" The two leaders last met in Paris in June, and are also both due at a summit of Mediterranean leaders in Malta on Friday.Meloni has also clashed over migration with Germany, whose president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was also among those at Napolitano's funeral. The Italian premier wrote to Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the weekend to complain about Berlin's funding of charity projects to help migrants either at sea or onshore in Italy.Rome blames the NGO boats that conduct rescue missions in the central Mediterranean – the world's deadliest sea crossing for migrants – for encouraging arrivals from North Africa. But data shows they do not work as a so-called pull factor, departures are based on the weather not the presence of NGO boats and the vast majority of migrants are rescued by the Italian coastguard, according to the Interior Ministry.Napolitano was a former communist who became the first Italian president to serve a second term. Renowned for his moderation and statesmanship, he was regarded as a guarantor of stability during a time of particular turbulence in Italian politics. In office from 2006 to 2015, he was president during the premierships of Romano Prodi, Silvio Berlusconi, Mario Monti, Enrico Letta and Matteo Renzi.Representatives from Albania, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Britain and the European Union were also announced among the guest list for the funeral.

JPMorgan to pay $75 million on claims it enabled Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operations,"    The bank is paying the settlement to the US Virgin Islands, where the late American financier had an estate. The Virgin Islands said JPMorgan enabled Epstein's recruiters to pay victims. ","JPMorgan Chase agreed on Tuesday, September 26, to pay $75 million to the US Virgin Islands to settle claims that the bank enabled the sex trafficking acts committed by financier Jeffrey Epstein.JPMorgan said that $55 million of the settlement will go toward local charities and assistance for victims. Another $20 million will go toward legal fees.The Virgin Islands, where Epstein had an estate, sued JPMorgan last year, saying its investigation revealed that the financial services giant enabled Epstein’s recruiters to pay victims and was ""indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise.""In effect, the Virgin Islands had argued that JPMorgan had been complicit in Epstein's behavior and did not raise any red flags to law enforcement or bank regulators about Epstein being a ""high risk"" customer and making repeated large cash withdrawals.The bank also said it reached a confidential legal settlement with James ""Jes"" Staley, the former top JPMorgan executive who managed the Epstein account before leaving the bank. JPMorgan sued Staley earlier this year, alleging that he covered up or minimized Epstein's wrongdoing in order to maintain the lucrative account.JPMorgan had already agreed to pay $290 million in June in a class-action lawsuit that involved victims of Epstein's trafficking crimes.

UK interior minister Braverman questions role of UN refugee convention,    UK minister Suella Braverman asked in a speech in the United States on Tuesday whether the UN Refugee Convention was 'fit' for the 'modern age'. ,"UK interior minister Suella Braverman on Tuesday, September 26, questioned whether the United Nations Refugee Convention was ""fit for our modern age"" during a keynote speech at a think-tank in Washington.The speech at the center-right American Enterprise Institute intended to lay out an international plan to deal with the refugee crisis, a key political issue for her struggling Conservative party back home. Braverman called the 1951 Refugee Convention, which legally defines the term ""refugee"" and outlines their rights, ""an incredible achievement of its age"".""But more than 70 years on, we now live in a completely different time,"" she said, citing a study that says the convention now gives at least 780 million people the potential right to move to another country.""It is therefore incumbent upon politicians and thought leaders to ask whether the Refugee Convention, and the way it has come to be interpreted through our courts, is fit for our modern age or in need of reform,"" she said.Western countries will not be able to sustain an asylum system ""if in effect simply being gay, or a woman, or fearful of discrimination in your country of origin, is sufficient to qualify for protection"", she added. ""We are living in a new world bound by outdated legal models. It's time we acknowledge that.""The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said the convention was ""the cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime and remains a life-saving instrument"".It added that the convention ""remains as relevant today as when it was adopted in providing an indispensable framework for addressing"" the challenges presented by the irregular movement of refugees.Brexit pressureThe UK government is currently languishing in the polls and has been struggling to stem the flow since Brexit of migrant boat crossings from mainland Europe. Almost 24,000 people have made the trip this year, adding to a record backlog in asylum claims and heaping pressure on ministers who promised to ""take back control"" of UK borders after leaving the European Union. Controversial proposals to tackle the issue include criminalising irregular migration and sending failed asylum seekers for resettlement in Rwanda.Braverman, a lawyer who has criticised the European Convention on Human Rights for blocking the government's Rwanda scheme, said that a system where ""people are able to travel through multiple safe countries... while they pick and choose their preferred destination to claim asylum, is absurd and unsustainable"".But the non-profit Refugee Council said the UK should instead be ""addressing the real issues in the asylum system, such as the record backlog, and providing safe routes for those in need of protection"" rather than taking aim at the UN convention.Yvette Cooper, home affairs spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, accused Braverman of having ""given up on fixing the Tories' asylum chaos"" and ""looking for anyone else to blame"".During her visit to the United States, Braverman is due to meet Homeland Security Secretary

"Lampedusa, at the gates of Fortress Europe",Feature,"With its stern turned away from the blue sea of late September, the Adriana returned to the port of Lampedusa. Topped by two dummy masts, the motorized replica of an imaginary pirate ship was back after the day's excursion. On the small Italian island, the tourist season was still in full swing and, in less than two hours, the ship would be taking on more holidaymakers for the evening tour, complete with aperitif, swimming under the stars and dolphin-watching. But as the toy-like boat made its way into the channel, another boat caught the attention of its swimsuit-clad passengers. Coming in from the open sea, beyond the turquoise coves, an Italian coastguard launch slowly crossed its path, carrying a compact mass of men and women, perhaps also children, whose arms, legs and life jackets could be made out. The two boats followed each other into Lampedusa harbor, dragging two parallel Mediterraneans in their wake.The Favaloro pier, where migrants arrive after a long journey, is off-limits. No one will hear about how their personal stories collided with the outside world. This port is merely a stopping point on the way to a more distant exile. It's a milestone already reached by tens of thousands of others this year, people who left Tunisia to cross the sea to Lampedusa. In the harbor are the things they left behind: a floating graveyard of worn fishing boats, inflatable dinghies, rusting hulls made of welded metal plates, as precarious as they are numerous along the ""Tunisian route,"" coming from the Sfax region, which is where the majority of people leave from.Surrounded by nurses, two women from the speedboat made their way with difficulty along the quayside. Television cameras, held at a distance on the roof of a shed, were trained on them. Their faces hidden under a veil, they disappeared into a medical tent. Following four ""disembarkations,"" according to the current terminology,  on Monday, September 18, 530 people were transported from the port to the island's reception center called the ""hotspot,"" a blind spot where exiles usually stay for a night or two, before being evacuated by plane or boat to Sicily or mainland Italy.If there weren't so many journalists there, it would be a perfectly ordinary day in Lampedusa, where more than 60,000 migrants – mostly from sub-Saharan Africa – have transited since the beginning of June, according to figures from the Italian Red Cross. The presence of cameras testifies to the intensity of the crisis the previous week, which saw the careful logistics designed to keep Lampedusa's two realities apart briefly collapse.",Global-issues,stern turned away blue sea late september adriana returned port lampedusa topped two dummy masts motorized replica imaginary pirate ship back days excursion small italian island tourist season still full swing less two hours ship would taking holidaymakers evening tour complete aperitif swimming stars dolphin watching toy like boat made way channel another boat caught attention swimsuit clad passengers coming open sea beyond turquoise coves italian coastguard launch slowly crossed path carrying compact mass men women perhaps also children whose arms legs life jackets could made two boats followed lampedusa harbor dragging two parallel mediterraneans wake favaloro pier migrants arrive long journey limits one hear personal stories collided outside world port merely stopping point way distant exile milestone already reached tens thousands others year people left tunisia cross sea lampedusa harbor things left behind floating graveyard worn fishing boats inflatable dinghies rusting hulls made welded metal plates precarious numerous along tunisian route coming sfax region majority people leave surrounded nurses two women speedboat made way difficulty along quayside television cameras held distance roof shed trained faces hidden veil disappeared medical tent following four disembarkations according current terminology monday september people transported port islands reception center called hotspot blind spot exiles usually stay night two evacuated plane boat sicily mainland italy werent many journalists would perfectly ordinary day lampedusa migrants mostly sub saharan africa transited since beginning june according figures italian red cross presence cameras testifies intensity crisis previous week saw careful logistics designed keep lampedusas two realities apart briefly collapse,stern turn away blue sea late septemb adriana return port lampedusa top two dummi mast motor replica imaginari pirat ship back day excurs small italian island tourist season still full swing less two hour ship would take holidaymak even tour complet aperitif swim star dolphin watch toy like boat made way channel anoth boat caught attent swimsuit clad passeng come open sea beyond turquois cove italian coastguard launch slowli cross path carri compact mass men women perhap also children whose arm leg life jacket could made two boat follow lampedusa harbor drag two parallel mediterranean wake favaloro pier migrant arriv long journey limit one hear person stori collid outsid world port mere stop point way distant exil mileston alreadi reach ten thousand other year peopl left tunisia cross sea lampedusa harbor thing left behind float graveyard worn fish boat inflat dinghi rust hull made weld metal plate precari numer along tunisian rout come sfax region major peopl leav surround nurs two women speedboat made way difficulti along quaysid televis camera held distanc roof shed train face hidden veil disappear medic tent follow four disembark accord current terminolog monday septemb peopl transport port island recept center call hotspot blind spot exil usual stay night two evacu plane boat sicili mainland itali werent mani journalist would perfectli ordinari day lampedusa migrant mostli sub saharan africa transit sinc begin june accord figur italian red cross presenc camera testifi intens crisi previou week saw care logist design keep lampedusa two realiti apart briefli collaps
Migrants in Cyprus fear fresh violence after a wave of racist far-right attacks,Feature,"In the city of Limassol, on Cyprus' southern coast, life and business have returned to the multi-ethnic shops on the waterfront that were targeted in early September by anti-migrant attacks. A ransacked Vietnamese grocery store was reopening, Egyptian restaurants – whose windows were still shattered – were preparing grilled meats and a handful of men smoked hookah in a Syrian café. At night, Arab and Asian customers were getting haircuts from two Syrian hairdressers while Nepalese and Indian migrants met up for dinner in a small cafe.Nonetheless, ""it's not like it used to be,"" said a Nepalese woman who wished to remain anonymous. ""I really liked Cyprus: Every community had its own customs, and we all felt safe. Today, I live in fear of a repeat of the attacks."" The young widow has been supporting her daughter, who stayed behind in Nepal with relatives.""Syrian folks used to come and cool off in the evenings on the beach. It's a beautiful place, free of charge. Ever since the attacks they haven't come anymore. I used to feel comfortable in Cyprus, but now I'm wondering if I should leave,"" said Taysir Ramadan, a Syrian man who has lived in Cyprus for 15 years, where he ran a men's hair salon. He had saved CCTV images in his phone, capturing the explosion of hatred on the night of September 1: One of his employees can be seen dozing on a bench in front of the closed store. A group of men in hoodies come into view, beat him up, and then smash the shop window. Then one of them throws a Molotov cocktail into the store, which bursts into flames. ""It took a week of work to restore the place,"" said Taysir ruefully, estimating the damage at over €14,000.The wave of violence had been preceded by a demonstration on the waterfront, under the slogan ""Refugees not welcome."" Between 150 and 200 black-clad people participated, with many concealing their faces. Most of the foreign shopkeepers, who had often taken out loans to start their businesses, opted to close early. Some who lived nearby witnessed the scenes of destruction with their hearts pounding. ""I was in a room above the grocery store. I warned my mother not to come home, that it was dangerous,"" said Flora, a 17-year-old Vietnamese woman. ""We were minutes away from being killed,"" said Moustapha, a young Syrian hairdresser, still reeling from the fires of the Molotov cocktails. Witnesses have called out the apathetic police reaction that night.In the wake of the ransacking – which mainly targeted Arab shops – a series of racist beatings took place, lasting several days. Asian and African motor-scooter deliverymen, who can be seen waiting all over Limassol's old town outside restaurants and cafés popular with tourists and young Cypriots, were beaten up. ""At around 10 in the evening, some men came up to me carrying sticks and metal chains. They said 'go back to your country, we don't want you here,' and then beat me up. I was terrified. This is the third time I've been attacked in Limassol,"" said Larry Angeh. He arrived in Cyprus in 2021 and is originally from the English-speaking part of Cameroon, where there have been clashes between the army and separatists.",Global-issues,city limassol cyprus southern coast life business returned multi ethnic shops waterfront targeted early september anti migrant attacks ransacked vietnamese grocery store reopening egyptian restaurants whose windows still shattered preparing grilled meats handful men smoked hookah syrian caf night arab asian customers getting haircuts two syrian hairdressers nepalese indian migrants met dinner small cafe nonetheless like used said nepalese woman wished remain anonymous really liked cyprus every community customs felt safe today live fear repeat attacks young widow supporting daughter stayed behind nepal relatives syrian folks used come cool evenings beach beautiful place free charge ever since attacks havent come anymore used feel comfortable cyprus wondering leave said taysir ramadan syrian man lived cyprus years ran mens hair salon saved cctv images phone capturing explosion hatred night september one employees seen dozing bench front closed store group men hoodies come view beat smash shop window one throws molotov cocktail store bursts flames took week work restore place said taysir ruefully estimating damage wave violence preceded demonstration waterfront slogan refugees welcome black clad people participated many concealing faces foreign shopkeepers often taken loans start businesses opted close early lived nearby witnessed scenes destruction hearts pounding room grocery store warned mother come home dangerous said flora year old vietnamese woman minutes away killed said moustapha young syrian hairdresser still reeling fires molotov cocktails witnesses called apathetic police reaction night wake ransacking mainly targeted arab shops series racist beatings took place lasting several days asian african motor scooter deliverymen seen waiting limassols old town outside restaurants caf popular tourists young cypriots beaten around evening men came carrying sticks metal chains said back country dont want beat terrified third time ive attacked limassol said larry angeh arrived cyprus originally english speaking part cameroon clashes army separatists,citi limassol cypru southern coast life busi return multi ethnic shop waterfront target earli septemb anti migrant attack ransack vietnames groceri store reopen egyptian restaur whose window still shatter prepar grill meat hand men smoke hookah syrian caf night arab asian custom get haircut two syrian hairdress nepales indian migrant met dinner small cafe nonetheless like use said nepales woman wish remain anonym realli like cypru everi commun custom felt safe today live fear repeat attack young widow support daughter stay behind nepal rel syrian folk use come cool even beach beauti place free charg ever sinc attack havent come anymor use feel comfort cypru wonder leav said taysir ramadan syrian man live cypru year ran men hair salon save cctv imag phone captur explos hatr night septemb one employe seen doze bench front close store group men hoodi come view beat smash shop window one throw molotov cocktail store burst flame took week work restor place said taysir ruefulli estim damag wave violenc preced demonstr waterfront slogan refuge welcom black clad peopl particip mani conceal face foreign shopkeep often taken loan start busi opt close earli live nearbi wit scene destruct heart pound room groceri store warn mother come home danger said flora year old vietnames woman minut away kill said moustapha young syrian hairdress still reel fire molotov cocktail wit call apathet polic reaction night wake ransack mainli target arab shop seri racist beat took place last sever day asian african motor scooter deliverymen seen wait limassol old town outsid restaur caf popular tourist young cypriot beaten around even men came carri stick metal chain said back countri dont want beat terrifi third time ive attack limassol said larri angeh arriv cypru origin english speak part cameroon clash armi separatist
Number of dead or missing in Mediterranean tripled this summer,"    According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 2,500 migrants died or went missing in the Mediterranean between January 1 and September 24. ","The number of migrants who died or went missing trying to cross the Mediterranean this summer was three times the number seen in the same period last year, the UN said Friday, September 29.Between June and August, at least 990 people died or went missing in the dangerous central Mediterranean route between northern Africa and Europe, compared to 334 deaths over the same months in 2022, the UN's children's agency UNICEF said.The agency gave no separate number for children dying during the crossings, but said that 11,600 unaccompanied minors had been among the migrants trying to get to Italy on makeshift vessels between January and September, up 60% from the first nine months of 2022.""The Mediterranean has become a cemetery for children and their future,"" UNICEF coordinator Regina De Dominicis said. ""The tragic toll of children dying in search of asylum and security in Europe is the result of political choices and a defective migration system,"" she said.According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 2,500 migrants died or went missing in the Mediterranean between January 1 and September 24, 50% more than in the same period last year.",Global-issues,number migrants died went missing trying cross mediterranean summer three times number seen period last year said friday september june august least people died went missing dangerous central mediterranean route northern africa europe compared deaths months uns childrens agency unicef said agency gave separate number children dying crossings said unaccompanied minors among migrants trying get italy makeshift vessels january september first nine months mediterranean become cemetery children future unicef coordinator regina dominicis said tragic toll children dying search asylum security europe result political choices defective migration system said according high commissioner refugees migrants died went missing mediterranean january september period last year,number migrant die went miss tri cross mediterranean summer three time number seen period last year said friday septemb june august least peopl die went miss danger central mediterranean rout northern africa europ compar death month un children agenc unicef said agenc gave separ number children die cross said unaccompani minor among migrant tri get itali makeshift vessel januari septemb first nine month mediterranean becom cemeteri children futur unicef coordin regina dominici said tragic toll children die search asylum secur europ result polit choic defect migrat system said accord high commission refuge migrant die went miss mediterranean januari septemb period last year
At least 10 Cuban migrants killed in truck accident in Mexico,    The incident is the latest in a series of migrant deaths in Mexico amid a surge in migrants traveling toward the US border. ,"At least 10 Cuban migrants were killed and 25 injured on Sunday, October 1, when a cargo truck carrying them overturned in southern Mexico, the latest fatal crash involving US-bound migrants, local officials reported. The accident took place in southern Chiapas state, near the border with Guatemala, the report said. A source in the prosecutor's office who spoke on grounds of anonymity told AFP the victims were apparently from Cuba and all were women, including one minor.The accident occurred on a highway along the Pacific coast between the towns of Pijijiapan and Tonala, where migrants often travel as they attempt to reach the United States – part of a flow drawing increasingly urgent attention in Washington. The truck, its body built partly of wood, was destroyed, with the migrants' clothes, bags and backpacks strewn around it.On Thursday, two migrants died when a truck overturned in the Chiapas municipality of Mezcalapa. Thousands of migrants from different countries have been traveling across Mexico in cramped buses, trailers and freight trains – or on foot – in an attempt to reach the United States. In early August, at least 18 people died and another 23 were injured after a bus with local passengers and migrants from countries such as India, the Dominican Republic and some African nations plunged into a ravine in the state of Nayarit.This weekend, in the northern states of Chihuahua and Zacatecas, nearly 3,000 migrants were stranded in isolated areas when the freight trains they were traveling on inexplicably stopped. Mexican authorities said they had detained more than 189,000 migrants last month, while the US border patrol has reported 1.8 million apprehensions between October 2022 and August 2023.With the influx of migrants ""overwhelming"" Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has called on his US counterpart for ""help."" On Friday, Washington and Mexico City pledged to redouble their efforts to strengthen economic and security cooperation on migration issues, as well as drug and arms trafficking.Republican lawmakers in Washington have grown increasingly angered by the migrant arrivals and have called on President Joe Biden's administration to do more to address the issue. After passing a last-minute measure on Saturday to avoid a US government shutdown, Republican leaders have expressed a willingness to block any additional funding for Ukraine's war effort unless more is spent on the border.""I'm going to make sure that the weapons are provided for Ukraine,"" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, ""but they're not going to get some big package if the border is not secure."" He did not define what it would take for him to consider the border as being ""secure.""",Global-issues,least cuban migrants killed injured sunday october cargo truck carrying overturned southern mexico latest fatal crash involving bound migrants local officials reported accident took place southern chiapas state near border guatemala report said source prosecutors office spoke grounds anonymity told afp victims apparently cuba women including one minor accident occurred highway along pacific coast towns pijijiapan tonala migrants often travel attempt reach united states part flow drawing increasingly urgent attention washington truck body built partly wood destroyed migrants clothes bags backpacks strewn around thursday two migrants died truck overturned chiapas municipality mezcalapa thousands migrants different countries traveling across mexico cramped buses trailers freight trains foot attempt reach united states early august least people died another injured bus local passengers migrants countries india dominican republic african nations plunged ravine state nayarit weekend northern states chihuahua zacatecas nearly migrants stranded isolated areas freight trains traveling inexplicably stopped mexican authorities said detained migrants last month border patrol reported million apprehensions october august influx migrants overwhelming mexico president andres manuel lopez obrador called counterpart help friday washington mexico city pledged redouble efforts strengthen economic security cooperation migration issues well drug arms trafficking republican lawmakers washington grown increasingly angered migrant arrivals called president joe bidens administration address issue passing last minute measure saturday avoid government shutdown republican leaders expressed willingness block additional funding ukraines war effort unless spent border going make sure weapons provided ukraine house speaker kevin mccarthy told cbss face nation sunday theyre going get big package border secure define would take consider border secure,least cuban migrant kill injur sunday octob cargo truck carri overturn southern mexico latest fatal crash involv bound migrant local offici report accid took place southern chiapa state near border guatemala report said sourc prosecutor offic spoke ground anonym told afp victim appar cuba women includ one minor accid occur highway along pacif coast town pijijiapan tonala migrant often travel attempt reach unit state part flow draw increasingli urgent attent washington truck bodi built partli wood destroy migrant cloth bag backpack strewn around thursday two migrant die truck overturn chiapa municip mezcalapa thousand migrant differ countri travel across mexico cramp buse trailer freight train foot attempt reach unit state earli august least peopl die anoth injur bu local passeng migrant countri india dominican republ african nation plung ravin state nayarit weekend northern state chihuahua zacateca nearli migrant strand isol area freight train travel inexplic stop mexican author said detain migrant last month border patrol report million apprehens octob august influx migrant overwhelm mexico presid andr manuel lopez obrador call counterpart help friday washington mexico citi pledg redoubl effort strengthen econom secur cooper migrat issu well drug arm traffick republican lawmak washington grown increasingli anger migrant arriv call presid joe biden administr address issu pass last minut measur saturday avoid govern shutdown republican leader express willing block addit fund ukrain war effort unless spent border go make sure weapon provid ukrain hous speaker kevin mccarthi told cbss face nation sunday theyr go get big packag border secur defin would take consid border secur
300 migrants arrive in Spain's Canary islands by boat,    It marks the largest number of migrants to arrive on a single boat to the archipelago. The migratory route to Canary Islands has been particularly busy the last few years due to tighter controls in the Mediterranean. ,"A boat carrying 280 migrants landed on Tuesday, October 3, in Spain's Canary Islands, having crossed one of the most dangerous migratory routes in the Atlantic, a rescue organization told Agence France-Presse (AFP). It marks the largest number of migrants to arrive on a single boat to the archipelago, the rescue group said. The migrants consisted of 278 men including 10 boys plus two women, and are of sub-Saharan origin, according to rescuers who aided them on their arrival.Spain, and in particular the Canary archipelago off the coast of Africa, is one of the main gateways into Europe for irregular migrants. Spanish media reports said the vessel reached the port of La Restinga on the small island of El Hierro some 450 kilometers off the African coast. On Tuesday alone, El Hierro saw some 500 migrants land on its shores. Emergency services reported another boat arriving with 79 migrants while 127 others were rescued from sea.The Canaries saw 14,976 migrants arrive between January 1 and September 30, an increase of 19.8% compared with the same period in 2022, according to the latest figures from Spain's Interior Ministry.In recent years, the migratory route to the Canary Islands has been particularly busy due to tighter controls in the Mediterranean. Shipwrecks are frequent, as the crossing is particularly dangerous. NGOs regularly report fatal shipwrecks in Moroccan, Spanish and international waters, with unofficial estimates putting the death toll in the dozens, if not hundreds.Since the beginning of this year, 140 migrants have died or disappeared along this crossing, according to data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) from early September.The Spanish NGO Caminando Fronteras, which unlike the IOM relies on emergency calls from those at sea or their relatives, estimates that 778 migrants died or disappeared on this migration route in the first half of the year.",Global-issues,boat carrying migrants landed tuesday october spains canary islands crossed one dangerous migratory routes atlantic rescue organization told agence france presse afp marks largest number migrants arrive single boat archipelago rescue group said migrants consisted men including boys plus two women sub saharan origin according rescuers aided arrival spain particular canary archipelago coast africa one main gateways europe irregular migrants spanish media reports said vessel reached port restinga small island hierro kilometers african coast tuesday alone hierro saw migrants land shores emergency services reported another boat arriving migrants others rescued sea canaries saw migrants arrive january september increase compared period according latest figures spains interior ministry recent years migratory route canary islands particularly busy due tighter controls mediterranean shipwrecks frequent crossing particularly dangerous ngos regularly report fatal shipwrecks moroccan spanish international waters unofficial estimates putting death toll dozens hundreds since beginning year migrants died disappeared along crossing according data international organization migration iom early september spanish ngo caminando fronteras unlike iom relies emergency calls sea relatives estimates migrants died disappeared migration route first half year,boat carri migrant land tuesday octob spain canari island cross one danger migratori rout atlant rescu organ told agenc franc press afp mark largest number migrant arriv singl boat archipelago rescu group said migrant consist men includ boy plu two women sub saharan origin accord rescuer aid arriv spain particular canari archipelago coast africa one main gateway europ irregular migrant spanish media report said vessel reach port restinga small island hierro kilomet african coast tuesday alon hierro saw migrant land shore emerg servic report anoth boat arriv migrant other rescu sea canari saw migrant arriv januari septemb increas compar period accord latest figur spain interior ministri recent year migratori rout canari island particularli busi due tighter control mediterranean shipwreck frequent cross particularli danger ngo regularli report fatal shipwreck moroccan spanish intern water unoffici estim put death toll dozen hundr sinc begin year migrant die disappear along cross accord data intern organ migrat iom earli septemb spanish ngo caminando frontera unlik iom reli emerg call sea rel estim migrant die disappear migrat rout first half year
Malta summit urges more EU action to stop migration at source,    A sharp rise in migrants landing on the Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month has reignited tensions within the bloc and provided impetus to work for a fresh common strategy. ,"The leaders of nine Mediterranean and southern European countries called Friday, September 29, for a ""significant increase"" in the EU's efforts to tackle the thorny issue of migration at its roots, in origin and transit countries.Italian far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that front-line countries were struggling to deal with arrivals now, but without ""structural"" solutions from the bloc, ""everyone will be overwhelmed.""A sharp rise in migrants landing on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month has reignited tensions within the bloc and provided impetus to work for a fresh common strategy.French President Emmanuel Macron called for ""a united European response,"" urging ""solidarity with Italy, as we must show solidarity with all the countries of first entry.""The ""Med 9"" leaders met in Malta the day after EU interior ministers in Brussels finally made headway on new rules for how the bloc handles asylum seekers and illegal immigration.The revamped Pact on Migration and Asylum will seek to relieve pressure on frontline countries by relocating some arrivals to other EU states and the ""Med 9"" urged its adoption as soon as possible.But Meloni, whose hard-right government was elected a year ago on an anti-migrant ticket, said the redistribution of arriving migrants was not enough – a message reiterated in the ""Med 9"" joint statement.Tackling illegal migration calls for ""a sustained and holistic European response,"" the leaders of Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Slovenia and a representative of Spain said.""We recall the need for a significant increase in the EU's efforts on the external dimension front, with a renewed approach to effectively reduce primary movements and prevent departures,"" it said.After a meeting with Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Malta, Meloni told media she saw ""a will, on paper at least,"" to act as a bloc.It is ""something that has to be done on a European level to be really effective,"" she insisted.So far this year, the number of arrivals in Italy has surpassed 133,000, almost double the number during the same period last year, official data shows.As thousands of migrants slept on cots in the open air in Lampedusa's overwhelmed reception center two weeks ago, von der Leyen unveiled a 10-point plan to help Rome deal with the crisis.Von der Leyen's plan includes the possible expansion of naval missions in the Mediterranean – missions Meloni said should be run ""in agreement with North African authorities"".The European Commission said last week it was set to release the first installment of funds to Tunisia – one of the main launching points for boats – under a plan signed this year to bolster its coastguard and tackle traffickers.The EU deal with Tunisia is already producing ""very important signs of collaboration"", Meloni said, adding that it provides ""a model to be used in general with North African countries"".The bloc already signed a deal in 2017 with Libya, although critics say getting both countries to intercept and forcibly return boats makes the EU complicit in abuses.Rescue charity Sea Watch said Friday its surveillance plane Seabird had witnessed a Libyan coastguard boat – a vessel gifted by Italy – ramming a migrant dinghy carrying some 50 people.The charity said it was not clear whether any of the migrants had drowned in the ""violent"" incident.At least 990 migrants died or went missing in the crossing between June and August this year, three times the number recorded in the same period last year, the UN's agency for children UNICEF said Friday.At least 289 children have died so far this year trying to make the crossing, with UNICEF warning the Mediterranean had become a ""cemetery for children and their future"".Rome has criticized Germany for funding charity rescue ships operating in the Central Mediterranean, the world's deadliest sea crossing for migrants.Italy has suggested charity ships sailing under foreign flags should be forced under EU rules to disembark them in their own countries, Meloni said Friday.But according to Italian media reports, that amendment was rejected by interior ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday.The ""Med 9"" leaders also urged ""immediate action"" on the climate crisis, following a devastating earthquake in Morocco, flood disaster in Libya, and extreme weather events in Southern Europe.Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called for ""much more emphasis on adaptation, disaster relief and managing the very costly aftermath.""",Global-issues,leaders nine mediterranean southern european countries called friday september significant increase eus efforts

Pope Francis opens Vatican meeting on the Church's future,"    From Wednesday, bishops and lay people will take part in a month-long synod to discuss how the institution functions in the future, the last major opportunity for 87-year-old Pope Francis to leave his mark on the Church. ","The 364 members of the synod opted for silence and prayer before beginning discussions on the future of the Catholic Church. On Saturday, September 30, after an ecumenical prayer celebrated by Pope Francis accompanied by the heads of other Christian Churches in St. Peter's Square, the members traveled to Sacrofano, some 20 kilometers from Rome. For four days, they went on a retreat to prepare for the mission entrusted to them by Francis.Church governance, the ordination of married men, the place of women and the laity, and the management of sexual violence committed by members of the clergy: The key topics that the faithful have put on the table and that this assembly will have to debate are likely to shake up the institution. Launched in 2021 by the pope, this ""synod on synodality,"" in Catholic terminology, aims to place the faithful at the center of the Church's functioning, in a context overshadowed by the vocations crisis in part of the world and by the ever-growing reports of sexual scandals. For Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the pope who will soon be 87, the aim is nothing less than to ""germinate dreams in the Church."" This summit meeting, which will be followed by a second one in a year's time, could be the last major opportunity of his pontificate to forge his legacy.In many ways, the process that will conclude in 2024 is historic. For the first time, lay people, including women, are being called upon not only to discuss but also to deliberate alongside the bishops to whom synods are usually reserved. Of the 365 voters (364 without Pope Francis), the assembly includes 96 lay people, 54 of them women. Among them is French nun Nathalie Becquart, under-secretary of the synod, one of the highest-ranking women in the Holy See.While the bishops were elected by their episcopal conference and the religious chosen by their order, some members were appointed by the Pope himself. Among them are Spanish theologian Cristina Inoges Sanz, renowned for her studies in so-called feminist theology, and American Jesuit priest James Martin, known for his defense of the inclusion of homosexuals in the Church.The Synod is also historic in that it is the result of a consultation unlike any that has taken place in the past. The faithful from all over the world gathered in their parishes to send in their contributions on how they felt the Church should function to keep pace with the times. Their writings were then grouped first by country, then by continent, before being sent to Rome. Based on this feedback, the Holy See produced a working document containing questions on which synod members are invited to collaborate. After the second session, in 2024, Francis is expected to formulate in a text the conclusions he has drawn for the Church from this process.",Global-issues,members synod opted silence prayer beginning discussions future catholic church saturday september ecumenical prayer celebrated pope francis accompanied heads christian churches peters square members traveled sacrofano kilometers rome four days went retreat prepare mission entrusted francis church governance ordination married men place women laity management sexual violence committed members clergy key topics faithful put table assembly debate likely shake institution launched pope synod synodality catholic terminology aims place faithful center churchs functioning context overshadowed vocations crisis part world ever growing reports sexual scandals jorge mario bergoglio pope soon aim nothing less germinate dreams church summit meeting followed second one years time could last major opportunity pontificate forge legacy many ways process conclude historic first time lay people including women called upon discuss also deliberate alongside bishops synods usually reserved voters without pope francis assembly includes lay people women among french nun nathalie becquart secretary synod one highest ranking women holy see bishops elected episcopal conference religious chosen order members appointed pope among spanish theologian cristina inoges sanz renowned studies called feminist theology american jesuit priest james martin known defense inclusion homosexuals church synod also historic result consultation unlike taken place past faithful world gathered parishes send contributions felt church function keep pace times writings grouped first country continent sent rome based feedback holy see produced working document containing questions synod members invited collaborate second session francis expected formulate text conclusions drawn church process,member synod opt silenc prayer begin discuss futur cathol church saturday septemb ecumen prayer celebr pope franci accompani head christian church peter squar member travel sacrofano kilomet rome four day went retreat prepar mission entrust franci church govern ordin marri men place women laiti manag sexual violenc commit member clergi key topic faith put tabl assembl debat like shake institut launch pope synod synod cathol terminolog aim place faith center church function context overshadow vocat crisi part world ever grow report sexual scandal jorg mario bergoglio pope soon aim noth less germin dream church summit meet follow second one year time could last major opportun pontif forg legaci mani way process conclud histor first time lay peopl includ women call upon discuss also deliber alongsid bishop synod usual reserv voter without pope franci assembl includ lay peopl women among french nun nathali becquart secretari synod one highest rank women holi see bishop elect episcop confer religi chosen order member appoint pope among spanish theologian cristina inog sanz renown studi call feminist theolog american jesuit priest jame martin known defens inclus homosexu church synod also histor result consult unlik taken place past faith world gather parish send contribut felt church function keep pace time write group first countri contin sent rome base feedback holi see produc work document contain question synod member invit collabor second session franci expect formul text conclus drawn church process
EU states reach deal on migration reforms,    Wednesday's deal would involve setting up processing centers on the EU's outside borders and includes the option to detain people until their asylum claims are assessed. ,"European Union countries on Wednesday, October 4, overcame a major obstacle in their yearslong quest to overhaul the bloc's asylum rules amid warnings that time is running out to clinch agreement on the entire scheme before next year's EU elections.EU envoys clinched a deal on a ""crisis regulation"" of extraordinary measures that a country could take in the event of a massive, unforeseen movement of migrants toward its borders. It means that the 27 member states now have a negotiating position to take into talks with the EU parliament.Wednesday's deal would involve setting up processing centers on the EU's outside borders where people would be screened when they arrive and includes the option to detain people until their asylum claims are assessed.""Today we have achieved a huge step forward on a critical issue for the future of the EU,"" said Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska, whose country currently holds the bloc's rotating presidency. He said it could allow the EU to seal the so-called New Pact on Asylum and Migration by year's end.The pact was touted as the answer to the EU's migration woes when it was made public in September 2020. The bloc's old rules collapsed in 2015 after well over 1 million people arrived in Europe without authorization. Most were fleeing war in Syria or Iraq. But little progress was made on the pact as the member states bickered over which country should take charge of migrants when they arrive and whether other countries should be obligated to help.Instead, the EU focused on outsourcing the challenge by clinching morally questionable agreements with countries that people leave or transit to get to Europe. A deal with Tunisia, where authorities have been accused of dumping migrants in the desert, was the latest example.The clock is ticking on the whole asylum deal. Elections will be held across the EU in June. For the scheme to enter force, officials and lawmakers say, an agreement on all its 10 parts must be reached between the member countries and parliament by February.A new European Commission and European Parliament will start work next year and they may want to modify the pact, raising the risk that it might unravel. Countries with anti-migrant governments – Hungary, first, then Poland – will take over the EU presidency after the polls.""Time is running out. In a few months there will be elections. We need the pact done and dusted before Europeans go out to vote,"" commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas told lawmakers in Strasbourg, France. ""The whole of Europe is now watching us,"" he said. ""If we fail then we will give fuel to the false claims made by the enemies of democracy, by Russian disinformation, that Europe is incapable of managing migration.""Schinas and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are part of the conservative European People's Party, the biggest bloc in the EU parliament. They want to woo the party of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni into the fold and have taken a tougher line on migrants recently.Human rights organizations are concerned about the EU's approach to its migration pact. ""It is vital that the rush to reach an agreement does not lead to human rights being side-lined in the process. We fully expect all EU institutions to insist that these rights are guaranteed as negotiations advance in the coming months,"" said Eve Geddie, director of Amnesty International's EU office.",Global-issues,european union countries wednesday october overcame major obstacle yearslong quest overhaul blocs asylum rules amid warnings time running clinch agreement entire scheme next years elections envoys clinched deal crisis regulation extraordinary measures country could take event massive unforeseen movement migrants toward borders means member states negotiating position take talks parliament wednesdays deal would involve setting processing centers eus outside borders people would screened arrive includes option detain people asylum claims assessed today achieved huge step forward critical issue future said spanish interior minister fernando grande marlaska whose country currently holds blocs rotating presidency said could allow seal called new pact asylum migration years end pact touted answer eus migration woes made public september blocs old rules collapsed well million people arrived europe without authorization fleeing war syria iraq little progress made pact member states bickered country take charge migrants arrive whether countries obligated help instead focused outsourcing challenge clinching morally questionable agreements countries people leave transit get europe deal tunisia authorities accused dumping migrants desert latest example clock ticking whole asylum deal elections held across june scheme enter force officials lawmakers say agreement parts must reached member countries parliament february new european commission european parliament start work next year may want modify pact raising risk might unravel countries anti migrant governments hungary first poland take presidency polls time running months elections need pact done dusted europeans vote commission vice president margaritis schinas told lawmakers strasbourg france whole europe watching said fail give fuel false claims made enemies democracy russian disinformation europe incapable managing migration schinas commission president ursula von der leyen part conservative european peoples party biggest bloc parliament want woo party italian prime minister giorgia meloni fold taken tougher line migrants recently human rights organizations concerned eus approach migration pact vital rush reach agreement lead human rights side lined process fully expect institutions insist rights guaranteed negotiations advance coming months said eve geddie director amnesty internationals office,european union countri wednesday octob overcam major obstacl yearslong quest overhaul bloc asylum rule amid warn time run clinch agreement entir scheme next year elect envoy clinch deal crisi regul extraordinari measur countri could take event massiv unforeseen movement migrant toward border mean member state negoti posit take talk parliament wednesday deal would involv set process center eu outsid border peopl would screen arriv includ option detain peopl asylum claim assess today achiev huge step forward critic issu futur said spanish interior minist fernando grand marlaska whose countri current hold bloc rotat presid said could allow seal call new pact asylum migrat year end pact tout answer eu migrat woe made public septemb bloc old rule collaps well million peopl arriv europ without author flee war syria iraq littl progress made pact member state bicker countri take charg migrant arriv whether countri oblig help instead focus outsourc challeng clinch moral question agreement countri peopl leav transit get europ deal tunisia author accus dump migrant desert latest exampl clock tick whole asylum deal elect held across june scheme enter forc offici lawmak say agreement part must reach member countri parliament februari new european commiss european parliament start work next year may want modifi pact rais risk might unravel countri anti migrant govern hungari first poland take presid poll time run month elect need pact done dust european vote commiss vice presid margar schina told lawmak strasbourg franc whole europ watch said fail give fuel fals claim made enemi democraci russian disinform europ incap manag migrat schina commiss presid ursula von der leyen part conserv european peopl parti biggest bloc parliament want woo parti italian prime minist giorgia meloni fold taken tougher line migrant recent human right organ concern eu approach migrat pact vital rush reach agreement lead human right side line process fulli expect institut insist right guarante negoti advanc come month said eve geddi director amnesti intern offic
Greenland victims demand justice over forced IUD scandal,"    In the late 1960s, Danish doctors inserted intrauterine devices (IUDs) into approximately 50% of Greenland's women, sometimes without their consent. The aim was to reduce the archipelago's birth rate. ","Naja Lyberth and her fellow fighters don't want to wait any longer. For decades, they have kept silent, convinced that they were alone, consumed by the same ""sense of shame and guilt"" that consumes victims of sexual violence. On Monday, October 2, 67 of them sent a letter to the Danish government, demanding 300,000 kroner (around €40,000) each in compensation for what the state did to them.The scandal broke in the spring of 2022. A year earlier, 60-year-old psychologist Lyberth had spoken about her experience to the Greenlandic women's magazine Arnanut. She recounted the day in 1976 when she and her schoolmates from Maniitsoq, a small island in western Greenland, were sent to hospital. There, a Danish doctor had fitted them with an intrauterine device (IUD), without even consulting their parents. Lyberth was 14. She had never had sexual intercourse. She still remembers the pain she felt when the IUD entered her vagina, then her uterus.""The state stole my virginity,"" was the accusation she made in the article, in which another woman gave a similar account. At the time, Lyberth thought there were only a few of them. In Greenland, silence reigned. ""The subject was taboo,"" she said. Some didn't even know they were wearing an IUD, and only discovered it years later when they went to see a gynecologist because they couldn't get pregnant.After reading the article, two Danish journalists, Anne Pilegaard Petersen and Celine Klint, decided to investigate. They discovered that the IUD operation was in fact part of a campaign by Copenhagen to ""modernize"" Greenland, which became a Danish province in 1953, rather than a colony. At the time, the archipelago had one of the highest birth rates in the world. In 1964, 1,674 births were recorded for a population of 37,600. This demographic explosion was costing Denmark dearly.Widespread use of contraception was presented as the solution to all problems, including women's freedom. Between 1966 and 1970, Danish doctors fitted 4,500 IUDs. There were 9,000 women of childbearing age. According to Lyberth, the fate of Greenland’s women was of little importance: ""In Denmark, parents had to give their consent for a doctor to insert an IUD on a minor, but this was not the case in Greenland. And while Danish women had a choice of contraceptives, we were forced to use a model that had been known since 1968 to be unsuitable for women who had never given birth.""The campaign was effective. By 1970, the birth rate had almost halved. But women were suffering. Many faced complications, forcing some to have their uterus removed. ""A number [of them] had ectopic pregnancies or were never able to get pregnant,"" revealed Lyberth, who eventually had a son at the age of 35.",Global-issues,naja lyberth fellow fighters dont want wait longer decades kept silent convinced alone consumed sense shame guilt consumes victims sexual violence monday october sent letter danish government demanding kroner around compensation state scandal broke spring year earlier year old psychologist lyberth spoken experience greenlandic womens magazine arnanut recounted day schoolmates maniitsoq small island western greenland sent hospital danish doctor fitted intrauterine device iud without even consulting parents lyberth never sexual intercourse still remembers pain felt iud entered vagina uterus state stole virginity accusation made article another woman gave similar account time lyberth thought greenland silence reigned subject taboo said didnt even know wearing iud discovered years later went see gynecologist couldnt get pregnant reading article two danish journalists anne pilegaard petersen celine klint decided investigate discovered iud operation fact part campaign copenhagen modernize greenland became danish province rather colony time archipelago one highest birth rates world births recorded population demographic explosion costing denmark dearly widespread use contraception presented solution problems including womens freedom danish doctors fitted iuds women childbearing age according lyberth fate greenland women little importance denmark parents give consent doctor insert iud minor case greenland danish women choice contraceptives forced use model known since unsuitable women never given birth campaign effective birth rate almost halved women suffering many faced complications forcing uterus removed number ecto never able get pregnant revealed lyberth eventually son age,naja lyberth fellow fighter dont want wait longer decad kept silent convinc alon consum sens shame guilt consum victim sexual violenc monday octob sent letter danish govern demand kroner around compens state scandal broke spring year earlier year old psychologist lyberth spoken experi greenland women magazin arnanut recount day schoolmat maniitsoq small island western greenland sent hospit danish doctor fit intrauterin devic iud without even consult parent lyberth never sexual intercours still rememb pain felt iud enter vagina uteru state stole virgin accus made articl anoth woman gave similar account time lyberth thought greenland silenc reign subject taboo said didnt even know wear iud discov year later went see gynecologist couldnt get pregnant read articl two danish journalist ann pilegaard petersen celin klint decid investig discov iud oper fact part campaign copenhagen modern greenland becam danish provinc rather coloni time archipelago one highest birth rate world birth record popul demograph explos cost denmark dearli widespread use contracept present solut problem includ women freedom danish doctor fit iud women childbear age accord lyberth fate greenland women littl import denmark parent give consent doctor insert iud minor case greenland danish women choic contracept forc use model known sinc unsuit women never given birth campaign effect birth rate almost halv women suffer mani face complic forc uteru remov number ecto never abl get pregnant reveal lyberth eventu son age
'We need to better compensate the work providing the greatest value for society',"Olivier De Schutter, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, argues that labor compensation should encompass more than just monetary gains and also acknowledge the impact of work on social well-being.","Europe is facing a purchasing power crisis of unprecedented proportions. In 2022, inflation averaged 9.6% in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and 9.2% in the European Union (EU), according to Eurostat. In the same timeframe, however, wages rose by only 4.4% in the EU, meaning that real wages have dropped by 2.4% in Europe; in Italy, real wages are now 12% below what they were in 2008. This is a global trend: The International Labour Organization (ILO) reported that real wages fell (by 0.9%) in 2022 for the first time in this century. What's more, inequalities are set to rise as the most precarious members of society spend a larger share of their incomes on essential goods and services such as energy, food and mobility – the prices of which have risen even faster than other components of household budgets.The decline of trade unions, globalization and the threat of offshoring, the development of insecure employment (including on work platforms) all help to explain why, everywhere, labor's share as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has been declining since the 1980s. In OECD countries, for example, it fell from 66.1% to 61.7% between 1990 and 2009.At the same time, there is a growing feeling that wages do not reflect the true value of the work provided. Beyond the extreme case of people offering their time for free within the household or the community (most of them women), there is a general feeling of unease: The most socially useful professions falling in the category of ""care"" work or the maintenance of the commons, are the least valued.In a study of the jobs that became ""essential"" during the Covid-19 pandemic, the ILO found that ""essential workers"" (most often female workers) earned, on average, 26% less than others and that at least a third of this gap cannot be explained by differences in qualifications. In other words, workers who provide vital services to society in sectors such as food production and retailing, healthcare, cleaning and sanitation, and transport are being underpaid.This should hardly come as a surprise: While labor's true contribution to general well-being cannot be limited to monetary value added, workers' bargaining power mainly depends on the price paid by the end consumer of the good or service. Yet those benefiting from the services provided by care workers are unwilling or unable to pay more. This is yet another reason for the current malaise: Because of how the value of work is currently determined in the labor market, its compensation is worse when responding to the needs of low-income earners rather than the demand expressed by wealthier households.",Global-issues,europe facing purchasing power crisis unprecedented proportions inflation averaged member countries organisation economic operation development oecd european union according eurostat timeframe however wages rose meaning real wages dropped europe italy real wages global trend international labour organization ilo reported real wages fell first time century whats inequalities set rise precarious members society spend larger share incomes essential goods services energy food mobility prices risen even faster components household budgets decline trade unions globalization threat offshoring development insecure employment including work platforms help explain everywhere labors share percentage gross domestic product gdp declining since oecd countries example fell time growing feeling wages reflect true value work provided beyond extreme case people offering time free within household community women general feeling unease socially useful professions falling category care work maintenance commons least valued study jobs became essential covid pandemic ilo found essential workers often female workers earned average less others least third gap explained differences qualifications words workers provide vital services society sectors food production retailing healthcare cleaning sanitation transport underpaid hardly come surprise labors true contribution general well limited monetary value added workers bargaining power mainly depends price paid end consumer good service yet benefiting services provided care workers unwilling unable pay yet another reason current malaise value work currently determined labor market compensation worse responding needs low income earners rather demand expressed wealthier households,europ face purchas power crisi unpreced proport inflat averag member countri organis econom oper develop oecd european union accord eurostat timefram howev wage rose mean real wage drop europ itali real wage global trend intern labour organ ilo report real wage fell first time centuri what inequ set rise precari member societi spend larger share incom essenti good servic energi food mobil price risen even faster compon household budget declin trade union global threat offshor develop insecur employ includ work platform help explain everywher labor share percentag gross domest product gdp declin sinc oecd countri exampl fell time grow feel wage reflect true valu work provid beyond extrem case peopl offer time free within household commun women gener feel uneas social use profess fall categori care work mainten common least valu studi job becam essenti covid pandem ilo found essenti worker often femal worker earn averag less other least third gap explain differ qualif word worker provid vital servic societi sector food product retail healthcar clean sanit transport underpaid hardli come surpris labor true contribut gener well limit monetari valu ad worker bargain power mainli depend price paid end consum good servic yet benefit servic provid care worker unwil unabl pay yet anoth reason current malais valu work current determin labor market compens wors respond need low incom earner rather demand express wealthier household
US to resume deportation flights to Venezuela,"    The Biden administration is set to recommence deportations of Venezuelan migrants, the largest group encountered at the US-Mexico border last month, as their numbers continue to increase amidst economic challenges in their home country. ","The United States said on Thursday, October 5, it will resume deportation flights to Venezuela after a deal with Caracas, as President Joe Biden, seeking reelection, comes under pressure to halt border crossings. Washington has for years halted sending migrants back to Venezuela due to instability in the South American nation and still maintains sanctions against the government of President Nicolas Maduro. But Venezuela, one of the main countries of origin for surging numbers of migrants crossing the southern US border from Mexico, agreed to take back its nationals, the US said.""Today the United States is announcing the resumption of removal flights to Venezuela,"" a senior Biden administration official said. ""This comes following a decision from the authorities of Venezuela to accept back their nationals."" The first flights will resume ""in the next few days"". They will affect Venezuelan migrants who have arrived in the United States illegally since July 31. ""We have already identified individuals in our custody today, who will be removed promptly in the coming days,"" the official said.Venezuela confirmed the deal but blamed US sanctions for the flow of migrants. ""The Venezuelan migration in recent years is the direct consequence of the unilateral coercive measures and the blockade of our economy... by the United States,"" the government said in a statement.The announcement comes on the same day as the Biden administration said it was extending the US border wall with Mexico, with Biden under pressure from Republicans to curb migration. More than 100,000 Venezuelans have been intercepted by US border patrol after crossing the southern US frontier from Mexico between May and the end of August, a source told AFP.The United States meanwhile denied that it was overlooking rights concerns in Venezuela to push through the deal. ""This decision is consistent with the administration's efforts to implement a strategy of humane, safe, and orderly enforcement of our immigration laws,"" the State Department statement said.Venezuela's Maduro, the heir to firebrand leftist Hugo Chavez, last won an election in 2018 in a vote widely criticized internationally for alleged irregularities. The United States declared Maduro to be illegitimate and recognized then opposition leader Juan Guaido, imposing sweeping sanctions on Venezuela including its key money-making oil sector. But Guaido failed to take control and the opposition removed him late last year.In signs of a possible thaw, the Biden administration last year approved an oil project in Venezuela by Chevron and has voiced a willingness to ease sanctions further in return for progress.",Global-issues,united states said thursday october resume deportation flights venezuela deal caracas president joe biden seeking reelection comes pressure halt border crossings washington years halted sending migrants back venezuela due instability south american nation still maintains sanctions government president nicolas maduro venezuela one main countries origin surging numbers migrants crossing southern border mexico agreed take back nationals said today united states announcing resumption removal flights venezuela senior biden administration official said comes following decision authorities venezuela accept back nationals first flights resume next days affect venezuelan migrants arrived united states illegally since july already identified individuals custody today removed promptly coming days official said venezuela confirmed deal blamed sanctions flow migrants venezuelan migration recent years direct consequence unilateral coercive measures blockade economy united states government said statement announcement comes day biden administration said extending border wall mexico biden pressure republicans curb migration venezuelans intercepted border patrol crossing southern frontier mexico may end august source told afp united states meanwhile denied overlooking rights concerns venezuela push deal decision consistent administrations efforts implement strategy humane safe orderly enforcement immigration laws state department statement said venezuelas maduro heir firebrand leftist hugo chavez last election vote widely criticized internationally alleged irregularities united states declared maduro illegitimate recognized opposition leader juan guaido imposing sweeping sanctions venezuela including key money making oil sector guaido failed take control opposition removed late last year signs possible thaw biden administration last year approved oil project venezuela chevron voiced willingness ease sanctions return progress,unit state said thursday octob resum deport flight venezuela deal caraca presid joe biden seek reelect come pressur halt border cross washington year halt send migrant back venezuela due instabl south american nation still maintain sanction govern presid nicola maduro venezuela one main countri origin surg number migrant cross southern border mexico agre take back nation said today unit state announc resumpt remov flight venezuela senior biden administr offici said come follow decis author venezuela accept back nation first flight resum next day affect venezuelan migrant arriv unit state illeg sinc juli alreadi identifi individu custodi today remov promptli come day offici said venezuela confirm deal blame sanction flow migrant venezuelan migrat recent year direct consequ unilater coerciv measur blockad economi unit state govern said statement announc come day biden administr said extend border wall mexico biden pressur republican curb migrat venezuelan intercept border patrol cross southern frontier mexico may end august sourc told afp unit state meanwhil deni overlook right concern venezuela push deal decis consist administr effort implement strategi human safe orderli enforc immigr law state depart statement said venezuela maduro heir firebrand leftist hugo chavez last elect vote wide critic intern alleg irregular unit state declar maduro illegitim recogn opposit leader juan guaido impos sweep sanction venezuela includ key money make oil sector guaido fail take control opposit remov late last year sign possibl thaw biden administr last year approv oil project venezuela chevron voic willing eas sanction return progress
2023 Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi honored for fight against oppression of Iranian women,"    The 51-year-old activist and journalist, who sacrificed everything to continue her struggle in Iran, is rewarded 'her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.' ","Just over a year after the death in police custody of young Mahsa Amini, which precipitated a violently repressed popular uprising in Iran, on Friday, October 6, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi, currently imprisoned in the Islamic Republic.The 51-year-old activist and journalist is being honored ""for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her struggle to promote human rights and freedom for all,"" said the president of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, in Oslo, as she called on Tehran to secure her release.Despite repression and multiple prison stays, Mohammadi, Iran's most famous human rights campaigner, has chosen to continue her fight in Iran, sacrificing even her family life. When her husband, Taghi Rahmani, an activist like herself, decided to leave Iran in 2012 after years of imprisonment, the Iranian woman didn't want to follow in his footsteps. Their twin children, Ali and Kiana, remained in Iran until 2015, before joining their father in Paris. ""Like the mother of Moses, I entrusted my two children to the River Nile,"" she described her heartbreak at the time, in a letter, written from the infamous Evin prison north of Tehran where she was serving a six-year sentence.At the time, her twins were just 8 years old. Since then, Mohammadi has seen neither her children nor her husband. Her life has been punctuated by arrests, threats and constant pressure from the Iranian secret services.The news of her Nobel Peace Prize sparked a wave of joy in Iran. ""I'm happy that Narges, as an Iranian woman and human rights activist, has won this award,"" said a political activist from Tehran, who has known the laureate for over two decades and prefers to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""She focused on human rights and hardly hesitated to pay the heaviest price, i.e. being away from her husband and children. For this, she received a lot of criticism, but she felt that her duty to Iranian society was more important.""Another political activist living in Tehran, who has known Mohammadi for 23 years, said, ""The most visible trait of her character is her audacity. If she considers a cause just, she fights for it to the end.""Mohammadi, now 52, was for years the spokesperson for the Iranian Human Rights Association, founded by the other 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner, lawyer Shirin Ebadi. She was also a signatory of the ""Campaign for the Gradual Abolition of the Death Penalty"" petition, for which she was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2015. Her multiple and prolonged stays in detention caused her neurological disorders resulting in muscular paralysis. In 2020, she was released after more than five years in prison.",Global-issues,year death police custody young mahsa amini precipitated violently repressed popular uprising iran friday october nobel peace prize awarded iranian activist narges mohammadi currently imprisoned islamic republic year old activist journalist honored fight oppression women iran struggle promote human rights freedom said president norwegian nobel committee berit reiss andersen oslo called tehran secure release despite repression multiple prison stays mohammadi irans famous human rights campaigner chosen continue fight iran sacrificing even family life husband taghi rahmani activist like decided leave iran years imprisonment iranian woman didnt want follow footsteps twin children ali kiana remained iran joining father paris like mother moses entrusted two children river nile described heartbreak time letter written infamous evin prison north tehran serving six year sentence time twins years old since mohammadi seen neither children husband life punctuated arrests threats constant pressure iranian secret services news nobel peace prize sparked wave joy iran happy narges iranian woman human rights activist award said political activist tehran known laureate two decades prefers remain anonymous fear reprisals focused human rights hardly hesitated pay heaviest price away husband children received lot criticism felt duty iranian society important another political activist living tehran known mohammadi years said visible trait character audacity considers cause fights end mohammadi years spokesperson iranian human rights association founded nobel peace prize winner lawyer shirin ebadi also signatory campaign gradual abolition death penalty petition sentenced years prison multiple prolonged stays detention caused neurological disorders resulting muscular paralysis released five years prison,year death polic custodi young mahsa amini precipit violent repress popular upris iran friday octob nobel peac prize award iranian activist narg mohammadi current imprison islam republ year old activist journalist honor fight oppress women iran struggl promot human right freedom said presid norwegian nobel committe berit reiss andersen oslo call tehran secur releas despit repress multipl prison stay mohammadi iran famou human right campaign chosen continu fight iran sacrif even famili life husband taghi rahmani activist like decid leav iran year imprison iranian woman didnt want follow footstep twin children ali kiana remain iran join father pari like mother mose entrust two children river nile describ heartbreak time letter written infam evin prison north tehran serv six year sentenc time twin year old sinc mohammadi seen neither children husband life punctuat arrest threat constant pressur iranian secret servic news nobel peac prize spark wave joy iran happi narg iranian woman human right activist award said polit activist tehran known laureat two decad prefer remain anonym fear repris focus human right hardli hesit pay heaviest price away husband children receiv lot critic felt duti iranian societi import anoth polit activist live tehran known mohammadi year said visibl trait charact audac consid caus fight end mohammadi year spokesperson iranian human right associ found nobel peac prize winner lawyer shirin ebadi also signatori campaign gradual abolit death penalti petit sentenc year prison multipl prolong stay detent caus neurolog disord result muscular paralysi releas five year prison
Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Iranian women's rights campaigner Narges Mohammadi,    The imprisoned Iranian activist was named as the recipient of the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday 'for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.' ,"Imprisoned Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, October 6, in recognition of her tireless campaigning for women's rights and democracy and against the death penalty.Mohammadi, 51, has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and spending years behind bars.""This prize is first and foremost a recognition of the very important work of a whole movement in Iran with its undisputed leader, Nargis Mohammadi,"" said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who announced the prize in Oslo.She said the committee hopes the prize ""is an encouragement to continue the work in whichever form this movement finds to be fitting."" She also urged Iran to release Mohammadi in time for the prize ceremony on December 10.For nearly all of Mohammadi's life, Iran has been governed by a Shiite theocracy headed by the country's supreme leader. While women hold jobs, academic positions and even government appointments, their lives can be tightly controlled. Laws require all women to at least wear a headscarf, or hijab, to cover their hair as a sign of piety. Iran and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only countries that mandate it.In a statement to the New York Times, Mohammadi said the ""global support and recognition of my human rights advocacy makes me more resolved, more responsible, more passionate and more hopeful. I also hope this recognition makes Iranians protesting for change stronger and more organized. Victory is near.""Mohammadi has been imprisoned 13 times and convicted five times, according to Reiss-Andersen. In total, she has been sentenced to 31 years in prison. Mohammadi's most recent incarceration began when she was detained in 2021 after she attended a memorial for a person killed in nationwide protests sparked by an increase in gasoline prices. She has been held at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison, whose inmates include those with Western ties and political prisoners.""The women of Iran have been an inspiration for the world. Their courage and determination in the face of reprisals, intimidation, violence and detention have been remarkable,"" said Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the UN human rights office in Geneva. ""We call for her release and the release of all other human rights defenders detained in Iran.""Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman, after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi won the award in 2003. It's the fifth time in the 122-year history of the awards that the Peace Prize has been given to someone who is in prison or under house arrest. Last year, the top human rights advocate in Belarus, Ales Bialiatski, was among the winners. He remains imprisoned.Mohammadi was behind bars for the recent protests over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. That sparked one of the most intense challenges ever to Iran's theocracy. More than 500 people were killed in a heavy security crackdown while over 22,000 others were arrested.From behind bars, she contributed an opinion piece for the New York Times. ""What the government may not understand is that the more of us they lock up, the stronger we become,"" she wrote.In a first reaction from Tehran, the semi-official Fars news agency dismissed Mohammadi as someone who ""persisted in creating tension and unrest and falsely claimed that she was beaten in prison."" Fars is believed to be close to Iran's hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which answers only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Abuse in Iranian prisons – something Mohammadi has campaigned against both outside of and behind bars – has been widely reported by the UN and human rights groups. Before being jailed, Mohammadi was vice president of the banned Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran. Ebadi, who Mohammadi is close to, founded the center.In 2018, Mohammadi, an engineer, was awarded the Andrei Sakharov Prize. Earlier this year, PEN America, which advocates for freedom of speech, gave Mohammadi its PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award. The organization applauded her win.The choice ""is a tribute to her courage and that of countless women and girls who have poured out into the streets of Iran and faced down one of the world's most brutal and stubborn regimes, risking their lives to demand their rights,"" PEN America CEO Suzanne Nossel said in a statement.The Nobel Prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1 million). Winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma at the award ceremonies in December.In addition to Bialiatski, human rights activists from Ukraine and Russia also shared last year's prize, in

18 migrants killed in Mexico bus crash,"    The dead, three of them minors, were from Venezuela and Haiti, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office in Oaxaca state. ","A bus carrying migrants overturned in southern Mexico on Friday, October 6, leaving at least 18 passengers dead and 27 injured, authorities said – the latest fatal road crash involving US-bound migrants.The dead, three of them minors, were from Venezuela and Haiti, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office in Oaxaca state. The accident happened at around dawn on a highway linking Oaxaca and the neighboring state of Puebla, it said. The injured were taken to hospital for treatment, it added.Images released by state authorities showed the wreckage of the bus lying on its side on a highway winding through hills.Thousands of migrants from different countries have been traveling across Mexico in buses, overcrowded trailers and atop freight trains in an attempt to reach the US-Mexican border. More than 8,200 migrants have died or disappeared in the Americas since 2014, most of them while trying to reach the United States via Mexico, according to the International Organization for Migration.On Sunday, at least 10 Cuban migrants were killed and 25 injured when a cargo truck carrying them overturned in the southern state of Chiapas. In early August, at least 18 people died and 23 were injured after a bus carrying local passengers and migrants from countries such as India, the Dominican Republic and some African nations plunged into a ravine in the state of Nayarit.On Thursday, senior US and Mexican officials pledged to redouble their efforts to tackle irregular migration through measures such as modernizing border security, increasing legal avenues and addressing the root causes.The two countries were committed to expanding ""safe, orderly and lawful pathways for migrants"" but with ""strict consequences"" for those who enter the United States illegally, US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said after the talks in Mexico City.",Global-issues,bus carrying migrants overturned southern mexico friday october leaving least passengers dead injured authorities said latest fatal road crash involving bound migrants dead three minors venezuela haiti according statement prosecutors office oaxaca state accident happened around dawn highway linking oaxaca neighboring state puebla said injured taken hospital treatment added images released state authorities showed wreckage bus lying side highway winding hills thousands migrants different countries traveling across mexico buses overcrowded trailers atop freight trains attempt reach mexican border migrants died disappeared americas since trying reach united states via mexico according international organization migration sunday least cuban migrants killed injured cargo truck carrying overturned southern state chiapas early august least people died injured bus carrying local passengers migrants countries india dominican republic african nations plunged ravine state nayarit thursday senior mexican officials pledged redouble efforts tackle irregular migration measures modernizing border security increasing legal avenues addressing root causes two countries committed expanding safe orderly lawful pathways migrants strict consequences enter united states illegally homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas said talks mexico city,bu carri migrant overturn southern mexico friday octob leav least passeng dead injur author said latest fatal road crash involv bound migrant dead three minor venezuela haiti accord statement prosecutor offic oaxaca state accid happen around dawn highway link oaxaca neighbor state puebla said injur taken hospit treatment ad imag releas state author show wreckag bu lie side highway wind hill thousand migrant differ countri travel across mexico buse overcrowd trailer atop freight train attempt reach mexican border migrant die disappear america sinc tri reach unit state via mexico accord intern organ migrat sunday least cuban migrant kill injur cargo truck carri overturn southern state chiapa earli august least peopl die injur bu carri local passeng migrant countri india dominican republ african nation plung ravin state nayarit thursday senior mexican offici pledg redoubl effort tackl irregular migrat measur modern border secur increas legal avenu address root caus two countri commit expand safe orderli law pathway migrant strict consequ enter unit state illeg homeland secur secretari alejandro mayorka said talk mexico citi
"Iran media slam Mohammadi Nobel Peace Prize win, Biden calls for her release",    US President Joe Biden hailed Narges Mohammadi's 'unshakable courage' after being honored with the Nobel Peace Prize. She has been incarcerated since November 2021. ,"Media in Iran on Friday, October 6, lambasted jailed rights campaigner Narges Mohammadi who won the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize, saying she had ""collaborated with terrorist groups"" and committed ""anti-Iranian activities.""Foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani called the move to award Mohammadi the Peace Prize ""biased and political."" Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden called on Iran to free Mohammadi, hailing her ""unshakable courage"" after she won the Nobel Peace Prize. ""This award is a recognition that... the world still hears the clarion voice of Narges Mohammadi calling for freedom and equality,"" Biden said in a statement. ""I urge the government in Iran to immediately release her and her fellow gender equality advocates from captivity.""The 51-year-old journalist and activist has spent much of the past two decades on multiple charges, including spreading anti-state propaganda and committing acts against national security. Most recently, she has been incarcerated since November 2021.Mohammadi had expressed support for the protest movement that rocked Iran following the September 16, 2022, death in police custody of Mahsa Amini. Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women. Her death triggered months-long demonstrations which the authorities in Iran labeled as ""riots"" fomented by foreign governments.Iranian media also lashed out at both her and the award. The official IRNA news agency criticized the Nobel Committee for awarding ""a woman who collaborated with terrorist groups"" and who is ""unknown in her own country, particularly among Iranian women."" It said awarding Mohammadi the Peace Prize was an ""interventionist act"" meant to ""politicize the concept of human rights.""Tasnim news agency called her a ""security convict"" who committed ""subversive"" activities, and said the Nobel Peace Prize had a history of being handed to ""criminals."" Mehr published a column by ultraconservative analyst Mohammad Imani lambasting the award. Western governments ""pay one person the equivalent of a million euros and set a trap for thousands of mercenaries ready to betray their country,"" he said.Reformist media outlets published the news about Mohammadi being awarded the prize, but without passing comment. Several Iranian actresses detained in 2022 for supporting the protest movement congratulated Mohammadi.Katayoun Riahi, who was arrested last November and released after more than a week, on Instagram welcomed the Nobel Prize awarded to ""our honor who is in prison.""Also on Instagram, prominent actress Taraneh Alidoosti, who was arrested in January before her release three weeks later, posted: ""Freedom will come with you, dear Narges, because a woman like you has no place in prison.""",Global-issues,media iran friday october lambasted jailed rights campaigner narges mohammadi nobel peace prize saying collaborated terrorist groups committed anti iranian activities foreign ministry spokesperson nasser kanani called move award mohammadi peace prize biased political meanwhile president joe biden called iran free mohammadi hailing unshakable courage nobel peace prize award recognition world still hears clarion voice narges mohammadi calling freedom equality biden said statement urge government iran immediately release fellow gender equality advocates captivity year old journalist activist spent much past two decades multiple charges including spreading anti state propaganda committing acts national security recently incarcerated since november mohammadi expressed support protest movement rocked iran following september death police custody mahsa amini amini year old iranian kurd arrested allegedly violating islamic republics strict dress code women death triggered months long demonstrations authorities iran labeled riots fomented foreign governments iranian media also lashed award official irna news agency criticized nobel committee awarding woman collaborated terrorist groups unknown country particularly among iranian women said awarding mohammadi peace prize interventionist act meant politicize concept human rights tasnim news agency called security convict committed subversive activities said nobel peace prize history handed criminals mehr published column ultraconservative analyst mohammad imani lambasting award western governments pay one person equivalent million euros set trap thousands mercenaries ready betray country said reformist media outlets published news mohammadi awarded prize without passing comment several iranian actresses detained supporting protest movement congratulated mohammadi katayoun riahi arrested last november released week instagram welcomed nobel prize awarded honor prison also instagram prominent actress taraneh alidoosti arrested january release three weeks later posted freedom come dear narges woman like place prison,media iran friday octob lambast jail right campaign narg mohammadi nobel peac prize say collabor terrorist group commit anti iranian activ foreign ministri spokesperson nasser kanani call move award mohammadi peac prize bias polit meanwhil presid joe biden call iran free mohammadi hail unshak courag nobel peac prize award recognit world still hear clarion voic narg mohammadi call freedom equal biden said statement urg govern iran immedi releas fellow gender equal advoc captiv year old journalist activist spent much past two decad multipl charg includ spread anti state propaganda commit act nation secur recent incarcer sinc novemb mohammadi express support protest movement rock iran follow septemb death polic custodi mahsa amini amini year old iranian kurd arrest allegedli violat islam republ strict dress code women death trigger month long demonstr author iran label riot foment foreign govern iranian media also lash award offici irna news agenc critic nobel committe award woman collabor terrorist group unknown countri particularli among iranian women said award mohammadi peac prize interventionist act meant politic concept human right tasnim news agenc call secur convict commit subvers activ said nobel peac prize histori hand crimin mehr publish column ultraconserv analyst mohammad imani lambast award western govern pay one person equival million euro set trap thousand mercenari readi betray countri said reformist media outlet publish news mohammadi award prize without pass comment sever iranian actress detain support protest movement congratul mohammadi katayoun riahi arrest last novemb releas week instagram welcom nobel prize award honor prison also instagram promin actress taraneh alidoosti arrest januari releas three week later post freedom come dear narg woman like place prison
Over 500 migrants arrive on Spain's Canary Islands,    They have come over the past 24 hours in six large wooden boats after traversing the perilous Atlantic route from West Africa. ,"Over 500 migrants reached Spain's Canary Islands in six large wooden boats over the past 24 hours after traversing the perilous Atlantic route from West Africa, the country's maritime rescue service said on Friday, October 6.Their arrival came as European Union leaders met in Granada in southern Spain, with the thorny issue of migration in focus due to the recent surge in arrivals on the Italian island of Lampedusa. Three boats carrying a total of 275 people arrived at El Hierro, the smallest and most westerly of the Canary Islands, a spokeswoman for Spain's maritime rescue service said. Another two boats arrived in Tenerife and one boat arrived on Gran Canaria with a total of 243 people, bringing the total number of migrants who reached the archipelago on the six boats to 518, she added.The Canaries have experienced a surge in migrant arrivals in recent days as smugglers take advantage of calm weather to try to ferry people to the archipelago, located in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of Africa. At their nearest point, the islands are 100 kilometers from Morocco.A boat carrying 280 migrants landed on El Hierro on Tuesday, the largest number to arrive in the archipelago in a single vessel. Over 1,200 migrants have arrived over the past week on the tiny island, which is home to 11,000 people, overwhelming its social services, officials said.Juan Miguel Padron, the mayor of El Pinar near the port that has received the migrant boats, told Spanish public television ""all the nurses and doctors"" in the town had been pulled away to deal with the influx. Spanish authorities transferred some 500 migrants from El Hierro to Tenerife overnight on Thursday.In recent years, the migratory route to the Canary Islands has been particularly busy due to tighter controls in the Mediterranean Sea. Shipwrecks are frequent, as the crossing is particularly dangerous.The Canaries saw 14,976 migrants arrive between January 1 and September 30, an increase of 19.8% compared to the same period in 2022, according to the latest figures from Spain's Interior Ministry.",Global-issues,migrants reached spains canary islands six large wooden boats past hours traversing perilous atlantic route west africa countrys maritime rescue service said friday october arrival came european union leaders met granada southern spain thorny issue migration focus due recent surge arrivals italian island lampedusa three boats carrying total people arrived hierro smallest westerly canary islands spokeswoman spains maritime rescue service said another two boats arrived tenerife one boat arrived gran canaria total people bringing total number migrants reached archipelago six boats added canaries experienced surge migrant arrivals recent days smugglers take advantage calm weather try ferry people archipelago located atlantic ocean northwest coast africa nearest point islands kilometers morocco boat carrying migrants landed hierro tuesday largest number arrive archipelago single vessel migrants arrived past week tiny island home people overwhelming social services officials said juan miguel padron mayor pinar near port received migrant boats told spanish public television nurses doctors town pulled away deal influx spanish authorities transferred migrants hierro tenerife overnight thursday recent years migratory route canary islands particularly busy due tighter controls mediterranean sea shipwrecks frequent crossing particularly dangerous canaries saw migrants arrive january september increase compared period according latest figures spains interior ministry,migrant reach spain canari island six larg wooden boat past hour travers peril atlant rout west africa countri maritim rescu servic said friday octob arriv came european union leader met granada southern spain thorni issu migrat focu due recent surg arriv italian island lampedusa three boat carri total peopl arriv hierro smallest westerli canari island spokeswoman spain maritim rescu servic said anoth two boat arriv tenerif one boat arriv gran canaria total peopl bring total number migrant reach archipelago six boat ad canari experienc surg migrant arriv recent day smuggler take advantag calm weather tri ferri peopl archipelago locat atlant ocean northwest coast africa nearest point island kilomet morocco boat carri migrant land hierro tuesday largest number arriv archipelago singl vessel migrant arriv past week tini island home peopl overwhelm social servic offici said juan miguel padron mayor pinar near port receiv migrant boat told spanish public televis nurs doctor town pull away deal influx spanish author transfer migrant hierro tenerif overnight thursday recent year migratori rout canari island particularli busi due tighter control mediterranean sea shipwreck frequent cross particularli danger canari saw migrant arriv januari septemb increas compar period accord latest figur spain interior ministri
Japan seeks to strip Unification Church of official recognition,"    The Japanese government first ordered a probe into the Moon sect last year, following the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe. ","The Japanese government said on Thursday, October 12, it was seeking to strip official recognition from the Unification Church, the influential sect under intense scrutiny since the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida last year ordered a probe into the church after it emerged that Abe's alleged killer was motivated by resentment against the group. It has been accused of pressuring its followers into making hefty donations and blamed for child neglect among its members.If granted, the court dissolution order sought by the government would see the church lose its status as a tax-exempt organization but still be allowed to continue its religious practices.""In view of the extensive damage caused, we find that it falls under the grounds for ordering dissolution as stated in the religious corporations law,"" Education Minister Masahito Moriyama told reporters after a panel of experts unanimously agreed with the decision. The church ""forced a number of people to contribute donations and buy items (...) in a way that restricted their free decision-making and sabotaged their sound judgment,"" he added.The minister said the request would be filed to the Tokyo District Court as early as Friday, once ""preparations are complete.""Abe was gunned down in broad daylight last year while giving a campaign speech in the western Nara region. The suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, is said to have resented the sect over large donations his mother made that bankrupted his family. He could face the death penalty if convicted.Investigations after Abe's death revealed close ties between the church and many conservative ruling lawmakers in Japan. Four of Kishida's ministers have since stepped down over allegations of financial irregularities or links to the church.Abe, Japan's longest-serving leader, was not a member of the church but had addressed an affiliated group, as have other well-known speakers including Donald Trump. The former prime minister died on July 8, 2022, after being shot with a homemade gun as he spoke to supporters near a train station in Nara.Yamagami, who faces murder and weapons charges, was apprehended on the spot. He reportedly targeted Abe over his ties to the sect, of which Yamagami's mother was a follower.The suspect's uncle told local media his nephew sometimes called him for help when his mother left her children alone and without food while attending church. She donated 100 million yen (then around $1 million) to the group before declaring bankruptcy, he added.The church has confirmed his mother's membership but refused to reveal how much she donated over the years.Known officially as the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, the sect has denied wrongdoing and pledged to prevent ""excessive"" donations from members.Founded in South Korea in 1954 by Sun Myung Moon, the church, whose members are colloquially known as ""Moonies,"" rose to global prominence in the 1970s and '80s. Japan has since become a key financial hub for the church, which teaches Japanese believers they need to atone for their country's wartime occupation of Korea.",Global-issues,japanese government said thursday october seeking strip official recognition unification church influential sect intense scrutiny since assassination former prime minister shinzo abe prime minister fumio kishida last year ordered probe church emerged abes alleged killer motivated resentment group accused pressuring followers making hefty donations blamed child neglect among members granted court dissolution order sought government would see church lose status tax exempt organization still allowed continue religious practices view extensive damage caused find falls grounds ordering dissolution stated religious corporations law education minister masahito moriyama told reporters panel experts unanimously agreed decision church forced number people contribute donations buy items way restricted free decision making sabotaged sound judgment added minister said request would filed tokyo district court early friday preparations complete abe gunned broad daylight last year giving campaign speech western nara region suspect tetsuya yamagami said resented sect large donations mother made bankrupted family could face death penalty convicted investigations abes death revealed close ties church many conservative ruling lawmakers japan four kishidas ministers since stepped allegations financial irregularities links church abe japans longest serving leader member church addressed affiliated group well known speakers including donald trump former prime minister died july shot homemade gun spoke supporters near train station nara yamagami faces murder weapons charges apprehended spot reportedly targeted abe ties sect yamagamis mother follower suspects uncle told local media nephew sometimes called help mother left children alone without food attending church donated million yen around million group declaring bankruptcy added church confirmed mothers membership refused reveal much donated years known officially family federation world peace unification sect denied wrongdoing pledged prevent excessive donations members founded south korea sun myung moon church whose members colloquially known moonies rose global prominence japan since become key financial hub church teaches japanese believers need atone countrys wartime occupation korea,japanes govern said thursday octob seek strip offici recognit unif church influenti sect intens scrutini sinc assassin former prime minist shinzo abe prime minist fumio kishida last year order probe church emerg abe alleg killer motiv resent group accus pressur follow make hefti donat blame child neglect among member grant court dissolut order sought govern would see church lose statu tax exempt organ still allow continu religi practic view extens damag caus find fall ground order dissolut state religi corpor law educ minist masahito moriyama told report panel expert unanim agre decis church forc number peopl contribut donat buy item way restrict free decis make sabotag sound judgment ad minist said request would file tokyo district court earli friday prepar complet abe gun broad daylight last year give campaign speech western nara region suspect tetsuya yamagami said resent sect larg donat mother made bankrupt famili could face death penalti convict investig abe death reveal close tie church mani conserv rule lawmak japan four kishida minist sinc step alleg financi irregular link church abe japan longest serv leader member church address affili group well known speaker includ donald trump former prime minist die juli shot homemad gun spoke support near train station nara yamagami face murder weapon charg apprehend spot reportedli target abe tie sect yamagami mother follow suspect uncl told local media nephew sometim call help mother left children alon without food attend church donat million yen around million group declar bankruptci ad church confirm mother membership refus reveal much donat year known offici famili feder world peac unif sect deni wrongdo pledg prevent excess donat member found south korea sun myung moon church whose member colloqui known mooni rose global promin japan sinc becom key financi hub church teach japanes believ need aton countri wartim occup korea
"Narges Mohammadi, the Nobel Peace Prize for courage",    The imprisoned Iranian activist was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for women's rights. ,"Just over a year after the young Mahsa Amini died in police custody, precipitating a violently repressed popular uprising in Iran, on Friday, October 6, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi, currently imprisoned in the jails of the Islamic Republic.The 51-year-old journalist is being rewarded "" for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all,"" said the president of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, in Oslo, as she called on Tehran to release Mohammadi from prison.A tireless Iranian human rights defender, Mohammadi sacrificed everything to continue her fight in Iran. When her husband and activist Taghi Rahmani decided to leave the country in 2012 after years of imprisonment, she decided not to follow in his footsteps. Their twin children, Ali and Kiana, remained in Iran until 2015 before joining their father in Paris. ""Like the mother of Moses, I entrusted my two children to the River Nile,"" she wrote at the time in a letter from the infamous Evin prison, north of Tehran, where she was serving a six-year prison sentence. Her twins were only eight years old at the time. Since then, Mohammadi has seen neither her children nor her husband. Her life has been marked by arrests, threats, and constant pressure from the Iranian secret services.For many years, Mohammadi was the spokesperson for the Iranian organization Defenders of Human Rights Center, founded in 2003 by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and lawyer Shirin Ebadi. Bringing together leading Iranian lawyers such as Nasrin Sotoudeh (winner of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Human Rights in 2012), the group's mission was to support and defend political prisoners and their families, in addition to raising Iranian society's awareness about its rights.Mohammadi was arrested for the first time in 2010, a year after the ultraconservative former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-2013) was fraudulently re-elected. She was sentenced to six years in prison for her activities within this organization. In 2012, the journalist was released after being deemed unable to endure detention due to physical and neurological problems. She immediately took up the fight again. In 2013, she signed the ""Campaign for Step by Step Abolition of the Death Penalty"" petition, which led to her re-arrest a year later and a 10-year prison sentence. She claims to have been mistreated and abused by her prison guards on several occasions. Her multiple and lengthy stays in prison caused neurological disorders that resulted in muscular paralysis.",Global-issues,year young mahsa amini died police custody precipitating violently repressed popular uprising iran friday october nobel peace prize awarded iranian activist narges mohammadi currently imprisoned jails islamic republic year old journalist rewarded fight oppression women iran fight promote human rights freedom said president norwegian nobel committee berit reiss andersen oslo called tehran release mohammadi prison tireless iranian human rights defender mohammadi sacrificed everything continue fight iran husband activist taghi rahmani decided leave country years imprisonment decided follow footsteps twin children ali kiana remained iran joining father paris like mother moses entrusted two children river nile wrote time letter infamous evin prison north tehran serving six year prison sentence twins eight years old time since mohammadi seen neither children husband life marked arrests threats constant pressure iranian secret services many years mohammadi spokesperson iranian organization defenders human rights center founded nobel peace prize laureate lawyer shirin ebadi bringing together leading iranian lawyers nasrin sotoudeh winner european parliaments sakharov prize human rights groups mission support defend political prisoners families addition raising iranian societys awareness rights mohammadi arrested first time year ultraconservative former president mahmoud ahmadinejad fraudulently elected sentenced six years prison activities within organization journalist released deemed unable endure detention due physical neurological problems immediately took fight signed campaign step step abolition death penalty petition led arrest year later year prison sentence claims mistreated abused prison guards several occasions multiple lengthy stays prison caused neurological disorders resulted muscular paralysis,year young mahsa amini die polic custodi precipit violent repress popular upris iran friday octob nobel peac prize award iranian activist narg mohammadi current imprison jail islam republ year old journalist reward fight oppress women iran fight promot human right freedom said presid norwegian nobel committe berit reiss andersen oslo call tehran releas mohammadi prison tireless iranian human right defend mohammadi sacrif everyth continu fight iran husband activist taghi rahmani decid leav countri year imprison decid follow footstep twin children ali kiana remain iran join father pari like mother mose entrust two children river nile wrote time letter infam evin prison north tehran serv six year prison sentenc twin eight year old time sinc mohammadi seen neither children husband life mark arrest threat constant pressur iranian secret servic mani year mohammadi spokesperson iranian organ defend human right center found nobel peac prize laureat lawyer shirin ebadi bring togeth lead iranian lawyer nasrin sotoudeh winner european parliament sakharov prize human right group mission support defend polit prison famili addit rais iranian societi awar right mohammadi arrest first time year ultraconserv former presid mahmoud ahmadinejad fraudul elect sentenc six year prison activ within organ journalist releas deem unabl endur detent due physic neurolog problem immedi took fight sign campaign step step abolit death penalti petit led arrest year later year prison sentenc claim mistreat abus prison guard sever occas multipl lengthi stay prison caus neurolog disord result muscular paralysi
Refugee camps on Greek islands are once again overcrowded,"    For the first time in three years, the camps on the Greek islands near Turkey are once again full – and unsanitary. In just three months, some 17,500 migrants have arrived in Greece via the Aegean Sea. ","Two years after its inauguration with great fanfare, the enclosed camp of Zervou, on the island of Samos, which faces the Turkish coast, is no longer brand-new nor empty. The high-security site is, for the first time, overcrowded, bringing to mind the unsanitary conditions of the previous camp that overlooked the town of Vathy, where, at the peak of the 2015-2016 migration crisis, up to 10,000 refugees were crammed into makeshift shacks among garbage and rats.Journalists, who were invited to the opening to see the improvement in conditions (modern containers with Wi-Fi and air conditioning), have now been banned from entering, which Reporters Without Borders denounced on Wednesday, October 4 as a ""serious infringement of the right to information."" The Zervou compound, which is surrounded by barbed wire, currently accommodates over 4,000 migrants, although its initial stated capacity was 2,040.According to the Ministry of Migration, around 17,500 asylum seekers arrived on the Greek islands near Turkey between July and September, compared with some 17,000 over the whole of 2022. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the number of arrivals on the Greek islands between January and July increased by 136% compared to the same period in 2022. While the migration minister is trying to reassure the Greek public, pointing out that the 30,000 migrants who have arrived since the start of the year are nothing like the 800,000 or so who landed in 2015, concerns about camp conditions are resurfacing.Owen Breuil, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Samos, said, ""The water supply is inadequate. Refugees often can't shower or wash their clothes, which causes health problems. We have observed several cases of scabies, gastroenteritis and urinary tract infections, which are linked to this lack of hygiene.""In early September, a doctor was finally assigned to the camp. ""But for 4,000 people – and, furthermore, vulnerable populations, who suffer from high blood pressure, heart problems and post-traumatic stress – this is obviously not enough,"" said Breuil.

Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to Claudia Goldin for research on women’s labor market outcomes,    The Harvard professor is only the third woman to ever win the economics prize. ,"The Nobel Economics Prize was awarded on Monday, October 9, to Claudia Goldin, a professor at Harvard University, for research that has advanced the understanding of the gender gap in the labor market.The announcement went a tiny step to closing the Nobel committee’s own gender gap: Goldin is just the third woman to win the prize out of 93 economics laureates.She has studied 200 years of women's participation in the workplace, showing that despite continued economic growth, women's pay did not continuously catch up to men's and a divide still exists despite women gaining higher levels of education than men.""Understanding women’s role in the labor market is important for society. Thanks to Claudia Goldin’s groundbreaking research, we now know much more about the underlying factors and which barriers may need to be addressed in the future,"" said Jakob Svensson, chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences.Goldin does not offer solutions, but her research allows policymakers to tackle the entrenched problem, said Randi Hjalmarsson, a member of the prize committee.""She explains the source of the gap, and how it’s changed over time and how it varies with the stage of development. And therefore, there is no single policy,"" Hjalmarsson said. ""So it’s a complicated policy question because if you don’t know the underlying reason, a certain policy won’t work.""However, ""by finally understanding the problem and calling it by the right name, we will be able to pave a better route forward,"" Hjalmarsson said.Goldin had to become a data sleuth as she sought to fill in missing data for her research, Hjalmarsson said. For parts of history, systematic labor market records did not exist, and, if they did, information about women was missing.""So how did Claudia Goldin overcome this missing data challenge? She had to be a detective to dig through the archives to find novel data sources and creative ways to use them to measure these unknowns,"" Hjalmarsson said. Of receiving the award, Goldin, 77, ""was surprised and very, very glad,"" Ellegren said.It follows the awards in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace that were announced last week.The economics award was created in 1968 by Sweden's central bank and is formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.Last year's winners were former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, Douglas W.

Noble Peace Prize Winner Narges Mohammadi: The voice of Iranian protest,"Beyond the journalist and activist for women's rights and human rights, currently imprisoned in Iran, this distinction from the Norwegian committee is aimed at a vast protest movement triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini, just over a year ago.","The Iranian regime may well denounce a ""biased and political"" decision, and wave the conspiracy flag of a maneuver involving ""some European governments,"" but the reality is nevertheless damning: The infamous Evin prison in Tehran is now home to a Nobel Peace Prize winner. By honoring a prisoner, Narges Mohammadi, an activist for women's rights and human rights, with this prestigious distinction on Friday, October 6, the Norwegian committee paid tribute to her courage and determination.We can only applaud this choice and call on the Iranian authorities, as did many leaders around the world after this announcement, to restore her freedom. In addition to the journalist who is frequently arbitrarily arrested, and who is currently paying a new penalty for her tireless struggle against the excesses of the current regime in Teheran, this Nobel Peace Prize is aimed at a vast protest movement triggered by the brutal death of Mahsa Amini, just over a year ago. The young woman died at the hands of the morality police for wearing a headscarf in a manner deemed reprehensible.The award is also a symbolic response to the ruthless repression of this protest, which is embodied in the slogan ""Woman, Life, Freedom."" The triptych refers to the impasses that form a dark part of the legacy of this military-religious regime. Women are still considered second-class citizens. Aggravated by international sanctions due to the nuclear arms race, the economic crisis fueled by corruption and incompetence darkens future prospects. Freedom is being attacked on all fronts by the state and its militias.In a letter written in June behind the walls of Evin prison and published in Le Monde on the eve of the first anniversary of Amini's death, Mohammadi made the same observation. ""If you look closely at Iranian society, you will see that every individual is guilty of a desire to live at every moment of his life and in every place"" in the eyes of the regime, she wrote, convinced nonetheless that Iranians' fight for their freedoms will not die out.The activist knows her country too well not to know that this fight will be a long one. When Shirin Ebadi, the founding lawyer of the Defenders of Human Rights Center (for whom Mohammadi has long been a spokesperson), was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, while she was traveling abroad, thousands of Iranians celebrated her return. Any remaining hope of opening up the regime was swept away by waves of repression, and Ebadi resigned herself to exile six years later. Since then, the situation has only worsened.Sadly, there is likely to be an empty chair at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. In her, Narges Mohammadi issued an invitation to her readers: ""Be our voice, too, relay our message of hope, tell the world we are not behind these walls for nothing, and that we are now stronger than our tormentors who use every possible means to silence our society."" That voice rang out on October 6, louder than ever.",Global-issues,iranian regime may well denounce biased political decision wave conspiracy flag maneuver involving european governments reality nevertheless damning infamous evin prison tehran home nobel peace prize winner honoring prisoner narges mohammadi activist womens rights human rights prestigious distinction friday october norwegian committee paid tribute courage determination applaud choice call iranian authorities many leaders around world announcement restore freedom addition journalist frequently arbitrarily arrested currently paying new penalty tireless struggle excesses current regime teheran nobel peace prize aimed vast protest movement triggered brutal death mahsa amini year ago young woman died hands morality police wearing headscarf manner deemed reprehensible award also symbolic response ruthless repression protest embodied slogan woman life freedom triptych refers impasses form dark part legacy military religious regime women still considered second class citizens aggravated international sanctions due nuclear arms race economic crisis fueled corruption incompetence darkens future prospects freedom attacked fronts state militias letter written june behind walls evin prison published monde eve first anniversary aminis death mohammadi made observation look closely iranian society see every individual guilty desire live every moment life every place eyes regime wrote convinced nonetheless iranians fight freedoms die activist knows country well know fight long one shirin ebadi founding lawyer defenders human rights center mohammadi long spokesperson awarded nobel peace prize traveling abroad thousands iranians celebrated return remaining hope opening regime swept away waves repression ebadi resigned exile six years later since situation worsened sadly likely empty chair nobel peace prize ceremony narges mohammadi issued invitation readers voice relay message hope tell world behind walls nothing stronger tormentors use every possible means silence society voice rang october louder ever,iranian regim may well denounc bias polit decis wave conspiraci flag maneuv involv european govern realiti nevertheless damn infam evin prison tehran home nobel peac prize winner honor prison narg mohammadi activist women right human right prestigi distinct friday octob norwegian committe paid tribut courag determin applaud choic call iranian author mani leader around world announc restor freedom addit journalist frequent arbitrarili arrest current pay new penalti tireless struggl excess current regim teheran nobel peac prize aim vast protest movement trigger brutal death mahsa amini year ago young woman die hand moral polic wear headscarf manner deem reprehens award also symbol respons ruthless repress protest embodi slogan woman life freedom triptych refer impass form dark part legaci militari religi regim women still consid second class citizen aggrav intern sanction due nuclear arm race econom crisi fuel corrupt incompet darken futur prospect freedom attack front state militia letter written june behind wall evin prison publish mond eve first anniversari amini death mohammadi made observ look close iranian societi see everi individu guilti desir live everi moment life everi place eye regim wrote convinc nonetheless iranian fight freedom die activist know countri well know fight long one shirin ebadi found lawyer defend human right center mohammadi long spokesperson award nobel peac prize travel abroad thousand iranian celebr return remain hope open regim swept away wave repress ebadi resign exil six year later sinc situat worsen sadli like empti chair nobel peac prize ceremoni narg mohammadi issu invit reader voic relay messag hope tell world behind wall noth stronger tormentor use everi possibl mean silenc societi voic rang octob louder ever
UN warns of 'devastating human consequences' of Israel's evacuation order,"    A UN special rapporteur said that forcible population transfers are a 'crime against humanity.' The UN urged Israel to rescind the order, saying, 'Even wars have rules.' ","The UN expert on displacement said Friday she was ""horrified"" by Israel telling 1.1 million residents to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip, condemning the order as a crime against humanity.Paula Gaviria Betancur, the United Nations' special rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, said it was inconceivable that Gazans could move across a war zone without devastating consequences.Thousands of Palestinians fled to southern Gaza in search of refuge on Friday after Israel warned them to evacuate before an expected ground offensive against Hamas in retaliation for the deadliest attack in Israel's history.""Forcible population transfers constitute a crime against humanity, and collective punishment is prohibited under international humanitarian law,"" Gaviria Betancur said in a statement. ""We are horrified at the prospect of an additional one million Palestinians joining the over 423,000 people already forcibly driven from their homes by the violence over the past week.""""It is inconceivable that more than half of Gaza's population could traverse an active war zone, without devastating humanitarian consequences, particularly while deprived of essential supplies and basic services.""UN special rapporteurs are unpaid, independent figures mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not speak for the UN but report their findings to it. Gaviria Betancur urged Israel to rescind the evacuation order immediately, saying those currently displaced had nowhere to go.Meanwhile, the UN has also condemned Israel's order. UN chief Antonio Guterres appealed Friday for the protection of basic human rights as the Israel-Hamas conflict spiraled, stressing that ""even wars have rules"" and warning against using hostages as human shields.""The situation in Gaza has reached a dangerous new low,"" Guterres said ahead of a Security Council meeting on the volatile situation.""We need immediate humanitarian access throughout Gaza, so that we can get fuel, food and water to everyone in need,"" he said, adding that the blockaded enclave's health system was on the brink of collapse.His call for the protection of civilians came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country's fierce bombardment of Gaza was ""just the beginning.""",Global-issues,expert displacement said friday horrified israel telling million residents evacuate northern gaza strip condemning order crime humanity paula gaviria betancur united nations special rapporteur human rights internally displaced persons said inconceivable gazans could move across war zone without devastating consequences thousands palestinians fled southern gaza search refuge friday israel warned evacuate expected ground offensive hamas retaliation deadliest attack israels history forcible population transfers constitute crime humanity collective punishment prohibited international humanitarian law gaviria betancur said statement horrified prospect additional one million palestinians joining people already forcibly driven homes violence past week inconceivable half gazas population could traverse active war zone without devastating humanitarian consequences particularly deprived essential supplies basic services special rapporteurs unpaid independent figures mandated human rights council speak report findings gaviria betancur urged israel rescind evacuation order immediately saying currently displaced nowhere meanwhile also condemned israels order chief antonio guterres appealed friday protection basic human rights israel hamas conflict spiraled stressing even wars rules warning using hostages human shields situation gaza reached dangerous new low guterres said ahead security council meeting volatile situation need immediate humanitarian access throughout gaza get fuel food water everyone need said adding blockaded enclaves health system brink collapse call protection civilians came israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said countrys fierce bombardment gaza beginning,expert displac said friday horrifi israel tell million resid evacu northern gaza strip condemn order crime human paula gaviria betancur unit nation special rapporteur human right intern displac person said inconceiv gazan could move across war zone without devast consequ thousand palestinian fled southern gaza search refug friday israel warn evacu expect ground offens hama retali deadliest attack israel histori forcibl popul transfer constitut crime human collect punish prohibit intern humanitarian law gaviria betancur said statement horrifi prospect addit one million palestinian join peopl alreadi forcibl driven home violenc past week inconceiv half gaza popul could travers activ war zone without devast humanitarian consequ particularli depriv essenti suppli basic servic special rapporteur unpaid independ figur mandat human right council speak report find gaviria betancur urg israel rescind evacu order immedi say current displac nowher meanwhil also condemn israel order chief antonio guterr appeal friday protect basic human right israel hama conflict spiral stress even war rule warn use hostag human shield situat gaza reach danger new low guterr said ahead secur council meet volatil situat need immedi humanitarian access throughout gaza get fuel food water everyon need said ad blockad enclav health system brink collaps call protect civilian came isra prime minist benjamin netanyahu said countri fierc bombard gaza begin
'The dangerous political instrumentalization of the Israel-Palestine conflict in France was reactivated by the Hamas attack',"As France's list of terrorist attacks gets longer and conflict in the Middle East fills political discourse, it's important to remember the equality movement that swept France in the 1980s.","It was 40 years ago and it was a different world. The children of immigrants, who called themselves ""beurs"" (a colloquial French term for people whose parents or grandparents come from North Africa), dreamed of finding their place in a France that despised their parents and made them invisible, workers convinced that one day they would return ""to the homeland."" At the Elysée Palace, former socialist president François Mitterrand promised to change people's lives, while at the municipal elections, Jean-Marie Le Pen, father of Marine Le Pen and leader of the French far-right, emerged from electoral purgatory when his party's candidate was elected mayor of Dreux in western France. The Algerian war was not so far away, and trigger-happy nostalgics were targeting Arabs. In social housing estates, immigrant workers lived side-by-side with doctors, teachers and French workers for the first time; left-wing municipalities, with their volunteers and union activists, created a tight social fabric.On October 15, 1983, just four decades ago, a handful of young people decided to set off from Marseille, amidst general indifference, for a March for Equality and Against Racism. At the time – although it's tempting to idealize the era – violence, impunity and discrimination were widespread, mostly going ignored by politicians and the media. That generation of sons and daughters of immigrants, the vast majority Algerian, had quite simply decided to stop kowtowing to society's expectations like their parents had done, and demand their rights as French citizens.What sparked it (as has been the case so many times since then) was an incident with the police. Toumi Djaïdja, a son of a Harki (Harkis are Muslim Algerians who fought on the side of France during the Algerian war of independence) from the Minguettes housing estate in Vénissieux, near Lyon, was accused of driving into France's riot police after trying to escape a police roadside check. Legend has it that, on his hospital bed, after being injured by police in another altercation, he took up the idea of a march inspired by Martin Luther King's ""I have a dream"" march ""for jobs and freedom"" in Washington in 1963.It was the priest Christian Delorme and the pastor Jean Costil who strove for a dream of equality attained without violence. The march arrived in Paris on December 3, 1983, and 100,000 people with a shared ideal burst into the streets, leading to the then-president François Mitterrand receiving a delegation of marchers at the Elysée Palace.",Global-issues,years ago different world children immigrants called beurs colloquial french term people whose parents grandparents come north africa dreamed finding place france despised parents made invisible workers convinced one day would return homeland elys palace former socialist president fran ois mitterrand promised change peoples lives municipal elections jean marie pen father marine pen leader french far right emerged electoral purgatory partys candidate elected mayor dreux western france algerian war far away trigger happy nostalgics targeting arabs social housing estates immigrant workers lived side side doctors teachers french workers first time left wing municipalities volunteers union activists created tight social fabric october four decades ago handful young people decided set marseille amidst general indifference march equality racism time although tempting idealize era violence impunity discrimination widespread mostly going ignored politicians media generation sons daughters immigrants vast majority algerian quite simply decided stop kowtowing societys expectations like parents done demand rights french citizens sparked case many times since incident police toumi dja dja son harki harkis muslim algerians fought side france algerian war independence minguettes housing estate nissieux near lyon accused driving frances riot police trying escape police roadside check legend hospital bed injured police another altercation took idea march inspired martin luther kings dream march jobs freedom washington priest christian delorme pastor jean costil strove dream equality attained without violence march arrived paris december people shared ideal burst streets leading president fran ois mitterrand receiving delegation marchers elys palace,year ago differ world children immigr call beur colloqui french term peopl whose parent grandpar come north africa dream find place franc despis parent made invis worker convinc one day would return homeland eli palac former socialist presid fran oi mitterrand promis chang peopl live municip elect jean mari pen father marin pen leader french far right emerg elector purgatori parti candid elect mayor dreux western franc algerian war far away trigger happi nostalg target arab social hous estat immigr worker live side side doctor teacher french worker first time left wing municip volunt union activist creat tight social fabric octob four decad ago hand young peopl decid set marseil amidst gener indiffer march equal racism time although tempt ideal era violenc impun discrimin widespread mostli go ignor politician media gener son daughter immigr vast major algerian quit simpli decid stop kowtow societi expect like parent done demand right french citizen spark case mani time sinc incid polic toumi dja dja son harki harki muslim algerian fought side franc algerian war independ minguett hous estat nissieux near lyon accus drive franc riot polic tri escap polic roadsid check legend hospit bed injur polic anoth alterc took idea march inspir martin luther king dream march job freedom washington priest christian delorm pastor jean costil strove dream equal attain without violenc march arriv pari decemb peopl share ideal burst street lead presid fran oi mitterrand receiv deleg marcher eli palac
Morocco's earthquake survivors face the fear of sex crimes,"    In the High Atlas, communities and local associations are trying to protect the most vulnerable victims of the natural disaster from child predators, kidnappers and forced marriages. ","The little girl looked barely 10 years old. The man in his 40s, who called himself a ""volunteer"" in the earthquake-hit villages, posted an image on Instagram and wrote: ""She doesn't want to come with me to Casablanca. But she promised we'd get married when she's older."" In a matter of days, the story spread like wildfire in the High Atlas region that was hit hard on the night of September 8-9, reigniting a deep-seated fear of kidnappings and forced marriages.In the days that followed, another man was arrested after boasting that he would travel to the disaster areas to commit sex crimes. On social media, other messages posted by members of wealthy urban communities offered survivors the chance to come and act as their servants, ""as they have lost everything."" The offer is not insignificant: In Morocco, many domestic workers are underpaid, deprived of rights and sometimes abused or raped.In these poor, remote villages, women and children sometimes find themselves on the side of the road, exposed to the incessant passing of construction trucks, NGOs or spontaneous volunteers. And it's not easy to tell the difference between a good Samaritan and a malicious one. In the field, aid workers prefer not to talk too much about kidnapping.It has to be said that much of the awareness-raising work has been done on the internet, via numerous influencers. ""We've received around 10 reports of this kind of behavior,"" said Ghizlane Mamouni, lawyer and president of the Kif Mama Kif Baba association, which is at the forefront of the defense of children's and women's rights in the country. ""We have systematically lodged complaints."" Her association has also brought together 21 other local players to set up a special telephone hotline to report cases of violence.The associations have also published a manifesto summarizing what to do. In the aftermath of the earthquake, women face a ""risk of gender-based violence, including sexual harassment and assault"" and ""may be afraid to access essential services for safety reasons."" Lalla Hakima Drissi, from the NGO Global Diversity Foundation, confirmed this: ""One of the most urgent needs is toilets. At the moment, it's very difficult to access them, so many women wait until nightfall, to get away from the camp and out of sight of the men."" But they are all the more vulnerable in this situation because they find themselves alone.Many local initiatives, often spontaneous, have sprung up. In Ouirgane, after an hour and a half of winding roads from Marrakech, you have to show your credentials to enter the ramshackle camp set up in the alleys of what used to be a field of peach and olive trees. Sitting in front of the ""kitchen"" – a large tent in which worktops have been made from planks found in the rubble – Toufik Saidi, 42, said: ""We check in and out so as not to let anyone unknown into the camp.""",Global-issues,little girl looked barely years old man called volunteer earthquake hit villages posted image instagram wrote doesnt want come casablanca promised wed get married shes older matter days story spread like wildfire high atlas region hit hard night september reigniting deep seated fear kidnappings forced marriages days followed another man arrested boasting would travel disaster areas commit sex crimes social media messages posted members wealthy urban communities offered survivors chance come act servants lost everything offer insignificant morocco many domestic workers underpaid deprived rights sometimes abused raped poor remote villages women children sometimes find side road exposed incessant passing construction trucks ngos spontaneous volunteers easy tell difference good samaritan malicious one field aid workers prefer talk much kidnapping said much awareness raising work done internet via numerous influencers weve received around reports kind behavior said ghizlane mamouni lawyer president kif mama kif baba association forefront defense childrens womens rights country systematically lodged complaints association also brought together local players set special telephone hotline report cases violence associations also published manifesto summarizing aftermath earthquake women face risk gender based violence including sexual harassment assault may afraid access essential services safety reasons lalla hakima drissi ngo global diversity foundation confirmed one urgent needs toilets moment difficult access many women wait nightfall get away camp sight men vulnerable situation find alone many local initiatives often spontaneous sprung ouirgane hour half winding roads marrakech show credentials enter ramshackle camp set alleys used field peach olive trees sitting front kitchen large tent worktops made planks found rubble toufik saidi said check let anyone unknown camp,littl girl look bare year old man call volunt earthquak hit villag post imag instagram wrote doesnt want come casablanca promis wed get marri she older matter day stori spread like wildfir high atla region hit hard night septemb reignit deep seat fear kidnap forc marriag day follow anoth man arrest boast would travel disast area commit sex crime social media messag post member wealthi urban commun offer survivor chanc come act servant lost everyth offer insignific morocco mani domest worker underpaid depriv right sometim abus rape poor remot villag women children sometim find side road expos incess pass construct truck ngo spontan volunt easi tell differ good samaritan malici one field aid worker prefer talk much kidnap said much awar rais work done internet via numer influenc weve receiv around report kind behavior said ghizlan mamouni lawyer presid kif mama kif baba associ forefront defens children women right countri systemat lodg complaint associ also brought togeth local player set special telephon hotlin report case violenc associ also publish manifesto summar aftermath earthquak women face risk gender base violenc includ sexual harass assault may afraid access essenti servic safeti reason lalla hakima drissi ngo global divers foundat confirm one urgent need toilet moment difficult access mani women wait nightfal get away camp sight men vulner situat find alon mani local initi often spontan sprung ouirgan hour half wind road marrakech show credenti enter ramshackl camp set alley use field peach oliv tree sit front kitchen larg tent worktop made plank found rubbl toufik saidi said check let anyon unknown camp
The central part played by women in the 1983 March for Equality in France,News,"""Tomorrow I'm leaving."" Malika Boumediene still cannot believe she uttered this sentence to her mother one day in October 1983. At the age of 20, the shy young woman, who had never left the comforts of her family, suddenly announced that she wanted to leave their home in the rural department of Ardèche in southeast France. She wanted to join a collective march against racism that was passing through Saint-Vallier, on the other side of the Rhône River. Her mother was determined to dissuade her. ""She was really against it. She was scared for me. But I packed my little bag and left the next day,"" recalled the 60-year-old care assistant, still amazed at her audacity.In her living room on the second floor of a building overlooking a roundabout near Annonay in Ardèche, exhausted after a night on call, the mother of three revisited her past, leafing through a photo album. She conjured up her youthful face, her slightly sulky pout and the abundant curly hair that flashed above the banner of the small group on the road: ""March for Equality and Against Racism.""Born to Algerian parents who came to France after the end of the Second World War, Boumedienne was part of the original organizers behind the 1983 march. ""My mother was angry and wouldn't answer the phone when I called. But when the TV started talking about us, she began to accept it,"" she said. From around 20 participants at the outset, on October 15 in Marseille in southern France, they went to 100,000 at the finish line, on Saturday, December 3, at Place de la Bastille in central Paris. It was a communion of rare intensity. In the same year that Richard Attenborough's film celebrated Gandhi on cinema screens, these anonymous figures completed a peaceful march filled with hope, to denounce racist crimes, incessant police control and the feeling of rejection that weighed on second-generation North African immigrants. Among them, young women played a decisive, but little-known, role.Forty years on, Boumedienne takes no credit for her initiative, neither for the 1,500 kilometers she walked, nor for her presence in the small delegation received by former president François Mitterrand at the Elysée Palace. ""When we were on the podium, at the end of [Junior Minister in charge of immigrant workers] Georgina Dufoix's speech, we learned that eight persons had been designated to meet the president. I was chosen. He spent five minutes talking to each of us. He wanted to know how we lived in our towns.

France's Sénat starts debating contested immigration bill,    The government's text needs the support of conservative MPs to get through both houses of Parliament. ,"France's Sénat starts on Monday, November 6, to debate a hugely controversial immigration bill that the government says will bolster security for documented migrants but that opponents see as new evidence of a lurch to the right by President Emmanuel Macron.Left-wingers reject the bill's bid to expel more people and toughen conditions for undocumented migrants, while conservatives' hackles have been raised by provisions to regularise the situation of undocumented workers in sectors with labor shortages. It is the right flank that poses the biggest obstacle to Macron and his minority centrist government passing the legislation. Conservative MPs' votes will be needed to get the bill through the lower house of parliament, the Assemblée Nationale, while the right has a majority in the upper house, the Sénat.""This text is about firmness,"" Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said on Sunday, drawing on language meant to appeal to the conservative Les Républicains (LR) party. He vowed to ""find a way to get (the bill) through parliament"". But several attempts to get LR on board over the past year have fallen flat and there is little sign that this time will be different.""We can't have a bill that wants both to expel more people and regularise more people,"" Bruno Retailleau, the leader of the Sénat conservatives, told Agence France-Presse. He said any easing up of immigration law would be a ""sign of weakness"".Macron proposed broadening constitutional rules governing the type of social issues like immigration that can be put to referendum. The bone thrown towards the right has so far had little visible effect on rhetoric around the immigration bill.Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne on Monday rebuffed claims that regularising undocumented workers would create a ""pull effect"" and increase migration. Regularisations would benefit ""people who've been on our territory for years, who are well integrated, who've been working for years"", she told France Inter radio. The bill aims ""to more quickly remove those who shouldn't be here and at the same time to better integrate those who should remain"", Borne said.She nevertheless revealed continuing divisions within government when she opposed removing state medical aid for undocumented people, calling it ""a question of public health"". Darmanin has said he plans to ""eliminate"" the aid, replacing it only with cover for emergencies – calling it a step towards ""a good compromise"" with LR.Such talk, along with plans for annual migration quotas set by parliament and restrictions on allowing people to rejoin their families already in France, has drawn opposition from aid groups and left-leaning politicians. A protest was planned on Monday outside the Sénat building located in Paris' Luxembourg gardens.Debate around immigration was stoked in France over the summer by mass arrivals in Italy and a visit by Pope Francis to the southern French port city Marseille, where he urged people to welcome migrants. Last month's killing of a teacher by a Russian migrant with apparent jihadist beliefs has further ramped up the pressure.Marine Le Pen's far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party sees opportunity in its pet theme dominating political debate ahead of next year's European elections and in the long climb to the 2027 presidential election, when Macron cannot run again due to term limits. The immigration bill was ""a botched job"", RN vice-president Sebastien Chenu told RTL radio on Sunday – while saying the party's 80 MPs could vote for it in the hope of ""small results"".",Global-issues,frances nat starts monday november debate hugely controversial immigration bill government says bolster security documented migrants opponents see new evidence lurch right president emmanuel macron left wingers reject bills bid expel people toughen conditions undocumented migrants conservatives hackles raised provisions regularise situation undocumented workers sectors labor shortages right flank poses biggest obstacle macron minority centrist government passing legislation conservative mps votes needed get bill lower house parliament assembl nationale right majority upper house nat text firmness interior minister rald darmanin said sunday drawing language meant appeal conservative les publicains party vowed find way get bill parliament several attempts get board past year fallen flat little sign time different cant bill wants expel people regularise people bruno retailleau leader nat conservatives told agence france presse said easing immigration law would sign weakness macron proposed broadening constitutional rules governing type social issues like immigration put referendum bone thrown towards right far little visible effect rhetoric around immigration bill prime minister elisabeth borne monday rebuffed claims regularising undocumented workers would create pull effect increase migration regularisations would benefit people whove territory years well integrated whove working years told france inter radio bill aims quickly remove shouldnt time better integrate remain borne said nevertheless revealed continuing divisions within government opposed removing state medical aid undocumented people calling question public health darmanin said plans eliminate aid replacing cover emergencies calling step towards good compromise talk along plans annual migration quotas set parliament restrictions allowing people rejoin families already france drawn opposition aid groups left leaning politicians protest planned monday outside nat building located paris luxembourg gardens debate around immigration stoked france summer mass arrivals italy visit pope francis southern french port city marseille urged people welcome migrants last months killing teacher russian migrant apparent jihadist beliefs ramped pressure marine pens far right rassemblement national party sees opportunity pet theme dominating political debate ahead next years european elections long climb presidential election macron run due term limits immigration bill botched job vice president sebastien chenu told rtl radio sunday saying partys mps could vote hope small results,franc nat start monday novemb debat huge controversi immigr bill govern say bolster secur document migrant oppon see new evid lurch right presid emmanuel macron left winger reject bill bid expel peopl toughen condit undocu migrant conserv hackl rais provis regularis situat undocu worker sector labor shortag right flank pose biggest obstacl macron minor centrist govern pass legisl conserv mp vote need get bill lower hous parliament assembl national right major upper hous nat text firm interior minist rald darmanin said sunday draw languag meant appeal conserv le publicain parti vow find way get bill parliament sever attempt get board past year fallen flat littl sign time differ cant bill want expel peopl regularis peopl bruno retailleau leader nat conserv told agenc franc press said eas immigr law would sign weak macron propos broaden constitut rule govern type social issu like immigr put referendum bone thrown toward right far littl visibl effect rhetor around immigr bill prime minist elisabeth born monday rebuf claim regularis undocu worker would creat pull effect increas migrat regularis would benefit peopl whove territori year well integr whove work year told franc inter radio bill aim quickli remov shouldnt time better integr remain born said nevertheless reveal continu divis within govern oppos remov state medic aid undocu peopl call question public health darmanin said plan elimin aid replac cover emerg call step toward good compromis talk along plan annual migrat quota set parliament restrict allow peopl rejoin famili alreadi franc drawn opposit aid group left lean politician protest plan monday outsid nat build locat pari luxembourg garden debat around immigr stoke franc summer mass arriv itali visit pope franci southern french port citi marseil urg peopl welcom migrant last month kill teacher russian migrant appar jihadist belief ramp pressur marin pen far right rassembl nation parti see opportun pet theme domin polit debat ahead next year european elect long climb presidenti elect macron run due term limit immigr bill botch job vice presid sebastien chenu told rtl radio sunday say parti mp could vote hope small result
Six-year-old Muslim boy killed in Illinois hate crime linked to Israel-Hamas war,"    US President Joe Biden called for Americans to 'reject Islamaphobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred,' after a boy and his mother were stabbed at home by their landlord, who reportedly shouted 'You Muslims must die.' ","US President Joe Biden condemned the killing of a six-year-old Muslim boy as a ""horrific act of hate"" on Sunday, October 15, after authorities charged the assailant with murder and hate crimes for an attack allegedly linked to the war between Israel and Hamas.The child was stabbed 26 times by his landlord on Saturday and later died at hospital, while his 32-year-old mother was also wounded but expected to survive, the Will County sheriff's office in Illinois said in a statement.""Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,"" the sheriff's office said, adding the killing took place about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Chicago.Biden, in a statement late Sunday, confirmed that the woman was the boy's mother and said their ""Palestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we all seek – a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace."" ""This horrific act of hate has no place in America, and stands against our fundamental values,"" added Biden, calling for Americans to ""come together and reject Islamaphobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred.""Authorities said the woman managed to call 911 as she fought off the landlord, named by the sheriff's office as 71-year-old Joseph Czuba. ""Deputies located two victims inside the residence in a bedroom. Both victims had multiple stab wounds to their chest, torso, and upper extremities,"" the sheriff's statement said. A serrated military-style knife with a seven-inch blade was pulled from the boy's abdomen during the autopsy, the statement said.When police arrived they found Czuba sitting on the ground near the driveway of the residence with a laceration on his forehead. He was taken to hospital for treatment before being charged with murder, attempted murder, and two counts of hate crimes.""He knocked on the door and attempted to choke her, and said, 'you Muslims' must die,"" Ahmed Rehab, head of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Chicago office, told reporters, citing text messages sent by the woman to the murdered boy's father from her hospital bed. The attack was ""our worst nightmare,"" CAIR said in a statement.Israel declared war on Hamas last Sunday, a day after waves of the militant group's fighters broke through the heavily fortified border and shot, stabbed and burned to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. The subsequent relentless bombing has flattened neighborhoods and left at least 2,670 people dead in the Gaza Strip, the majority ordinary Palestinians.",Global-issues,president joe biden condemned killing six year old muslim boy horrific act hate sunday october authorities charged assailant murder hate crimes attack allegedly linked war israel hamas child stabbed times landlord saturday later died hospital year old mother also wounded expected survive county sheriffs office illinois said statement detectives able determine victims brutal attack targeted suspect due muslim ongoing middle eastern conflict involving hamas israelis sheriffs office said adding killing took place miles kilometers west chicago biden statement late sunday confirmed woman boys mother said palestinian muslim family came america seeking seek refuge live learn pray peace horrific act hate place america stands fundamental values added biden calling americans come together reject islamaphobia forms bigotry hatred authorities said woman managed call fought landlord named sheriffs office year old joseph czuba deputies located two victims inside residence bedroom victims multiple stab wounds chest torso upper extremities sheriffs statement said serrated military style knife seven inch blade pulled boys abdomen autopsy statement said police arrived found czuba sitting ground near driveway residence laceration forehead taken hospital treatment charged murder attempted murder two counts hate crimes knocked door attempted choke said muslims must die ahmed rehab head council american islamic relations cair chicago office told reporters citing text messages sent woman murdered boys father hospital bed attack worst nightmare cair said statement israel declared war hamas last sunday day waves militant groups fighters broke heavily fortified border shot stabbed burned death people civilians subsequent relentless bombing flattened neighborhoods left least people dead gaza strip majority ordinary palestinians,presid joe biden condemn kill six year old muslim boy horrif act hate sunday octob author charg assail murder hate crime attack allegedli link war israel hama child stab time landlord saturday later die hospit year old mother also wound expect surviv counti sheriff offic illinoi said statement detect abl determin victim brutal attack target suspect due muslim ongo middl eastern conflict involv hama isra sheriff offic said ad kill took place mile kilomet west chicago biden statement late sunday confirm woman boy mother said palestinian muslim famili came america seek seek refug live learn pray peac horrif act hate place america stand fundament valu ad biden call american come togeth reject islamaphobia form bigotri hatr author said woman manag call fought landlord name sheriff offic year old joseph czuba deputi locat two victim insid resid bedroom victim multipl stab wound chest torso upper extrem sheriff statement said serrat militari style knife seven inch blade pull boy abdomen autopsi statement said polic arriv found czuba sit ground near driveway resid lacer forehead taken hospit treatment charg murder attempt murder two count hate crime knock door attempt choke said muslim must die ahm rehab head council american islam relat cair chicago offic told report cite text messag sent woman murder boy father hospit bed attack worst nightmar cair said statement israel declar war hama last sunday day wave milit group fighter broke heavili fortifi border shot stab burn death peopl civilian subsequ relentless bomb flatten neighborhood left least peopl dead gaza strip major ordinari palestinian
Biden administration reaches settlement with separated migrant families at US-Mexico border,    The agreement reverses a Trump-era policy and provides support services for affected families and sets new standards to prevent future separations. ,"President Joe Biden's administration agreed to a settlement on Monday, October 16, with migrant families who were separated at the US-Mexico border during Donald Trump's term in office. ""The practice of separating families at the southwest border was shameful,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""This agreement will facilitate the reunification of separated families and provide them with critical services to aid in their recovery.""The settlement, which still needs the approval of a US District Court judge, will provide support services for separated families, the Justice Department said. The services include legal support for immigration claims, housing assistance and some medical coverage. It does not include any monetary damages. The proposed settlement also sets new standards intended to limit future separations of parents and children, the Justice Department said and bars the government from separating migrant families for the next eight years.""By providing services to these families and implementing policies to prevent future separations, today's agreement addresses the impacts of those separations and helps ensure that nothing like this happens again,"" Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said.Biden issued an executive order in February 2021, shortly after taking office, pledging to ""protect family unity and ensure that children entering the United States are not separated from their families."" An estimated 4,000 families were separated at the southern border in 2017 and 2018 under the Trump administration's so-called ""zero-tolerance policy.""Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the families in their class-action lawsuit, said the settlement ""closes the darkest chapter of the Trump administration."" ""To America's enduring shame, we tore children from the arms of their families to enact a xenophobic agenda,"" Romero said.Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the ACLU, said the settlement ""provides significant benefits to thousands of families, and an indispensable component bars the government from reenacting the zero-tolerance policy in the future.""",Global-issues,president joe bidens administration agreed settlement monday october migrant families separated mexico border donald trumps term office practice separating families southwest border shameful attorney general merrick garland said statement agreement facilitate reunification separated families provide critical services aid recovery settlement still needs approval district court judge provide support services separated families justice department said services include legal support immigration claims housing assistance medical coverage include monetary damages proposed settlement also sets new standards intended limit future separations parents children justice department said bars government separating migrant families next eight years providing services families implementing policies prevent future separations todays agreement addresses impacts separations helps ensure nothing like happens associate attorney general vanita gupta said biden issued executive order february shortly taking office pledging protect family unity ensure children entering united states separated families estimated families separated southern border trump administrations called zero tolerance policy anthony romero executive director american civil liberties union represented families class action lawsuit said settlement closes darkest chapter trump administration americas enduring shame tore children arms families enact xenophobic agenda romero said lee gelernt lawyer aclu said settlement provides significant benefits thousands families indispensable component bars government reenacting zero tolerance policy future,presid joe biden administr agre settlement monday octob migrant famili separ mexico border donald trump term offic practic separ famili southwest border shame attorney gener merrick garland said statement agreement facilit reunif separ famili provid critic servic aid recoveri settlement still need approv district court judg provid support servic separ famili justic depart said servic includ legal support immigr claim hous assist medic coverag includ monetari damag propos settlement also set new standard intend limit futur separ parent children justic depart said bar govern separ migrant famili next eight year provid servic famili implement polici prevent futur separ today agreement address impact separ help ensur noth like happen associ attorney gener vanita gupta said biden issu execut order februari shortli take offic pledg protect famili uniti ensur children enter unit state separ famili estim famili separ southern border trump administr call zero toler polici anthoni romero execut director american civil liberti union repres famili class action lawsuit said settlement close darkest chapter trump administr america endur shame tore children arm famili enact xenophob agenda romero said lee gelernt lawyer aclu said settlement provid signific benefit thousand famili indispens compon bar govern reenact zero toler polici futur
India's top court rejects legalizing same-sex marriages,"    India’s top court refused to legalize same-sex marriages, with the chief justice of the country saying that it was up to Parliament to create such a law. ","India's top court declined on Tuesday, October 17, to legalize same-sex marriages but said the country had a duty to acknowledge LGBTQ+ relationships and to protect them from discrimination.A five-judge constitutional bench – set up to consider important questions of law – began hearing submissions seeking the legalization of same-sex marriages in April, with arguments completed in May. Advocates representing nearly two dozen petitioners said it was time for India to treat the country's LGBTQ+ community as equal citizens under its constitution.But their verdict said that the charter did not guarantee a fundamental right to marry that would extend to same-sex couples under existing law. ""It lies within the domain of parliament and state legislatures to determine the law on marriage,"" Supreme Court Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said during his verdict.Chandrachud added that India still had a duty to acknowledge same-sex relationships and protect those in them from discrimination. ""Our ability to feel love and affection for one another makes us feel human,"" he said from the bench. ""This court has recognized that equality demands that queer unions and queer persons are not discriminated against.""The news was nonetheless greeted with disappointment by those who had gathered outside the court in the hopes of celebrating India becoming the second Asian jurisdiction outside Taiwan to legalize same-sex marriages.The petitioners had said validating same-sex marriage would help them access some of the legal benefits of matrimony, including adoption, insurance and inheritance.But the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has staunchly opposed same-sex marriage, and said that any change was up to parliament, not the courts. ""Any interference (...) would cause a complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws in the country and in accepted societal values,"" the government said in its submission. ""Living together as partners and having sexual relationship by same-sex individuals... is not comparable with the Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children,"" it added.Marriages are governed by family laws for specific religions, such as the Muslim Marriage Act and the Hindu Marriage Act. The judges have been considering whether the Special Marriage Act of 1954 – which allows marriages between people of different castes and religions – could be expanded.A landmark ruling in 2018 struck down the British colonial-era law criminalizing gay sex, and last year the court ruled that unmarried partners or same-sex couples were entitled to welfare benefits.",Global-issues,indias top court declined tuesday october legalize sex marriages said country duty acknowledge lgbtq relationships protect discrimination five judge constitutional bench set consider important questions law began hearing submissions seeking legalization sex marriages april arguments completed may advocates representing nearly two dozen petitioners said time india treat countrys lgbtq community equal citizens constitution verdict said charter guarantee fundamental right marry would extend sex couples existing law lies within domain parliament state legislatures determine law marriage supreme court chief justice chandrachud said verdict chandrachud added india still duty acknowledge sex relationships protect discrimination ability feel love affection one another makes feel human said bench court recognized equality demands queer unions queer persons discriminated news nonetheless greeted disappointment gathered outside court hopes celebrating india becoming second asian jurisdiction outside taiwan legalize sex marriages petitioners said validating sex marriage would help access legal benefits matrimony including adoption insurance inheritance hindu nationalist government prime minister narendra modi staunchly opposed sex marriage said change parliament courts interference would cause complete havoc delicate balance personal laws country accepted societal values government said submission living together partners sexual relationship sex individuals comparable indian family unit concept husband wife children added marriages governed family laws specific religions muslim marriage act hindu marriage act judges considering whether special marriage act allows marriages people different castes religions could expanded landmark ruling struck british colonial era law criminalizing gay sex last year court ruled unmarried partners sex couples entitled welfare benefits,india top court declin tuesday octob legal sex marriag said countri duti acknowledg lgbtq relationship protect discrimin five judg constitut bench set consid import question law began hear submiss seek legal sex marriag april argument complet may advoc repres nearli two dozen petition said time india treat countri lgbtq commun equal citizen constitut verdict said charter guarante fundament right marri would extend sex coupl exist law lie within domain parliament state legislatur determin law marriag suprem court chief justic chandrachud said verdict chandrachud ad india still duti acknowledg sex relationship protect discrimin abil feel love affect one anoth make feel human said bench court recogn equal demand queer union queer person discrimin news nonetheless greet disappoint gather outsid court hope celebr india becom second asian jurisdict outsid taiwan legal sex marriag petition said valid sex marriag would help access legal benefit matrimoni includ adopt insur inherit hindu nationalist govern prime minist narendra modi staunchli oppos sex marriag said chang parliament court interfer would caus complet havoc delic balanc person law countri accept societ valu govern said submiss live togeth partner sexual relationship sex individu compar indian famili unit concept husband wife children ad marriag govern famili law specif religion muslim marriag act hindu marriag act judg consid whether special marriag act allow marriag peopl differ cast religion could expand landmark rule struck british coloni era law crimin gay sex last year court rule unmarri partner sex coupl entitl welfar benefit
Refusing to normalize anti-Semitism,"Since October 7, French Jews have been confronted with a growing number of attacks and hate acts. But this is not just the result of a new outbreak of conflict in the Middle East. In reality, anti-Semitism, in its various guises, has taken root in our society.","The figures are here, and so is the fear. Since October 7, French Jews have returned to the anxieties that every new outbreak of conflict in the Middle East exposes them to: ostracism; the designation of their community as jointly responsible for violence elsewhere; and a sense of danger, too, in the face of increasing aggression and hate acts – the police have recorded over a thousand in the last month.Experts trace the rise of anti-Semitism in France back to the second Palestinian Intifada in 2000. It would be wrong, however, to regard this phenomenon as an episodic eruption, linked to regular outbreaks of unrest in the Middle East. In reality, anti-Semitism, in its many guises, has taken root in our society. In addition to the deep-seated anti-Semitism of the far right – which, in its new form, has not totally renounced the DNA of its origins – there are now the ambiguities and excesses of certain parts of the far left under the guise of anti-Zionism and the anti-Semitism of radical Islam.The anxiety of French Jews is amplified by a feeling of isolation and abandonment in the face of society's growing indifference to this rise in anti-Semitism. Over the years, after the initial wave of indignation, the ranks of demonstrators protesting anti-Semitic crimes have thinned, as if we were witnessing a normalization of this violence. Increasingly, Jews find themselves alone at these gatherings. ""There aren't many people left to support us,"" noted a demonstrator in Paris the day after the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, in the survey published today by Le Monde.This terrorist attack by Hamas, unprecedented in its scale and brutality, and the worldwide reaction to Israel's massive and indiscriminate retaliation in Gaza have generated a new element of fear among French Jews: aliyah is no longer seen as a refuge. Every time there has been an outbreak of anti-Semitic violence in France since the 2000s, a growing number have chosen to leave for Israel. Today, the Hamas attack has shown that even Israel can no longer guarantee their safety.The upsurge in anti-Semitic acts is not limited to France. In the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, where the phenomenon is particularly concerning, incidents and attacks have increased, as has intolerance, particularly in intellectual debate. But this is no excuse for France. It is home to the largest Jewish community in Europe, and the third largest in the world after Israel and the US. French Jews are part of its identity and history. It is unacceptable that a segment of the French nation, whatever its origin or religion, should be the target of regular hate campaigns and live in fear.By making almost 500 arrests since October 7, the authorities have shown that they intend to react vigorously to this new wave of anti-Semitic acts. It is also up to French society as a whole to rededicate itself to its fundamental values and to remind people again and again, particularly through education, that anti-Semitism, like racism, is unacceptable. Anti-Semitism must be neither commonplace, nor normalized or inexorable.",Global-issues,figures fear since october french jews returned anxieties every new outbreak conflict middle east exposes ostracism designation community jointly responsible violence elsewhere sense danger face increasing aggression hate acts police recorded thousand last month experts trace rise anti semitism france back second palestinian intifada would wrong however regard phenomenon episodic eruption linked regular outbreaks unrest middle east reality anti semitism many guises taken root society addition deep seated anti semitism far right new form totally renounced dna origins ambiguities excesses certain parts far left guise anti zionism anti semitism radical islam anxiety french jews amplified feeling isolation abandonment face societys growing indifference rise anti semitism years initial wave indignation ranks demonstrators protesting anti semitic crimes thinned witnessing normalization violence increasingly jews find alone gatherings arent many people left support noted demonstrator paris day hamas terrorist attack october survey published today monde terrorist attack hamas unprecedented scale brutality worldwide reaction israels massive indiscriminate retaliation gaza generated new element fear among french jews aliyah longer seen refuge every time outbreak anti semitic violence france since growing number chosen leave israel today hamas attack shown even israel longer guarantee safety upsurge anti semitic acts limited france united states united kingdom germany phenomenon particularly concerning incidents attacks increased intolerance particularly intellectual debate excuse france home largest jewish community europe third largest world israel french jews part identity history unacceptable segment french nation whatever origin religion target regular hate campaigns live fear making almost arrests since october authorities shown intend react vigorously new wave anti semitic acts also french society whole rededicate fundamental values remind people particularly education anti semitism like racism unacceptable anti semitism must neither commonplace normalized inexorable,figur fear sinc octob french jew return anxieti everi new outbreak conflict middl east expos ostrac design commun jointli respons violenc elsewher sens danger face increas aggress hate act polic record thousand last month expert trace rise anti semit franc back second palestinian intifada would wrong howev regard phenomenon episod erupt link regular outbreak unrest middl east realiti anti semit mani guis taken root societi addit deep seat anti semit far right new form total renounc dna origin ambigu excess certain part far left guis anti zionism anti semit radic islam anxieti french jew amplifi feel isol abandon face societi grow indiffer rise anti semit year initi wave indign rank demonstr protest anti semit crime thin wit normal violenc increasingli jew find alon gather arent mani peopl left support note demonstr pari day hama terrorist attack octob survey publish today mond terrorist attack hama unpreced scale brutal worldwid reaction israel massiv indiscrimin retali gaza gener new element fear among french jew aliyah longer seen refug everi time outbreak anti semit violenc franc sinc grow number chosen leav israel today hama attack shown even israel longer guarante safeti upsurg anti semit act limit franc unit state unit kingdom germani phenomenon particularli concern incid attack increas intoler particularli intellectu debat excus franc home largest jewish commun europ third largest world israel french jew part ident histori unaccept segment french nation whatev origin religion target regular hate campaign live fear make almost arrest sinc octob author shown intend react vigor new wave anti semit act also french societi whole reded fundament valu remind peopl particularli educ anti semit like racism unaccept anti semit must neither commonplac normal inexor
Germany takes tougher line on immigration,"    Following a conference, the Federal and Länder governments adopted a series of measures designed to stem the flow of undocumented migrants and tighten asylum policy. ","On Tuesday, November 7, after a night of negotiations, the German regions and the federal government agreed on a series of measures aimed at tightening immigration and asylum policy across the Rhine. For Germany, which over the past two years has adopted an open approach, guided by the urgent need to fill its labor shortage, this marks a turning point. The prevailing view is that the country has ""reached its limits,"" to use an expression widely deployed by politicians of all stripes. ""We need mechanisms to ensure that the number of refugees arriving here, especially through illegal immigration, is contained,"" declared Malu Dreyer, the Social Democrat Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate, ahead of the negotiations.The package of measures announced on Tuesday morning includes provisions to reduce the time taken to process asylum applications and to speed up the time taken to appeal these decisions, which often take years.The government also wants to conclude agreements with migrants' countries of origin and transit to facilitate deportations in exchange for legal immigration to Germany. Berlin wants to tighten controls at Europe's internal borders and is considering examining the status of asylum seekers in third countries. Family reunification is to be restricted, and a multi-party commission is to evaluate a reform of asylum law. A new division of financial burdens between the federal state and the regions was also agreed upon.The signal for this about-turn on migration had already been given by the chancellery on October 20. In an interview with Spiegel, Olaf Scholz declared that Germany ""must finally carry out large-scale deportations."" This was a new demonstration of firmness on the part of the Social Democrat chancellor, who in January said at the Davos conference that ""those who want to roll up their sleeves are welcome in Germany."" Nine months later, with the country in recession and the far right on the rise, it was no longer a time for invitations but for strict restrictions on illegal migratory flows, in consultation with the Christian-Democrat opposition in the Bundestag.Politically, this is a delicate turning point, as the number of asylum seekers in Germany is very high. According to figures from the Office for Migration and Refugees, over 250,000 people applied for asylum between January and September this year, 60% of them from Syria, Afghanistan and Turkey. Their numbers could reach 300,000 by the end of the year, according to experts, after 240,000 in 2022. In addition, 1.2 million Ukrainians have arrived since February 2022, and are exempt from the asylum procedure.",Global-issues,tuesday november night negotiations german regions federal government agreed series measures aimed tightening immigration asylum policy across rhine germany past two years adopted open approach guided urgent need fill labor shortage marks turning point prevailing view country reached limits use expression widely deployed politicians stripes need mechanisms ensure number refugees arriving especially illegal immigration contained declared malu dreyer social democrat minister president rhineland palatinate ahead negotiations package measures announced tuesday morning includes provisions reduce time taken process asylum applications speed time taken appeal decisions often take years government also wants conclude agreements migrants countries origin transit facilitate deportations exchange legal immigration germany berlin wants tighten controls europes internal borders considering examining status asylum seekers third countries family reunification restricted multi party commission evaluate reform asylum law new division financial burdens federal state regions also agreed upon signal turn migration already given chancellery october interview spiegel olaf scholz declared germany must finally carry large scale deportations new demonstration firmness part social democrat chancellor january said davos conference want roll sleeves welcome germany nine months later country recession far right rise longer time invitations strict restrictions illegal migratory flows consultation christian democrat opposition bundestag politically delicate turning point number asylum seekers germany high according figures office migration refugees people applied asylum january september year syria afghanistan turkey numbers could reach end year according experts addition million ukrainians arrived since february exempt asylum procedure,tuesday novemb night negoti german region feder govern agre seri measur aim tighten immigr asylum polici across rhine germani past two year adopt open approach guid urgent need fill labor shortag mark turn point prevail view countri reach limit use express wide deploy politician stripe need mechan ensur number refuge arriv especi illeg immigr contain declar malu dreyer social democrat minist presid rhineland palatin ahead negoti packag measur announc tuesday morn includ provis reduc time taken process asylum applic speed time taken appeal decis often take year govern also want conclud agreement migrant countri origin transit facilit deport exchang legal immigr germani berlin want tighten control europ intern border consid examin statu asylum seeker third countri famili reunif restrict multi parti commiss evalu reform asylum law new divis financi burden feder state region also agre upon signal turn migrat alreadi given chancelleri octob interview spiegel olaf scholz declar germani must final carri larg scale deport new demonstr firm part social democrat chancellor januari said davo confer want roll sleev welcom germani nine month later countri recess far right rise longer time invit strict restrict illeg migratori flow consult christian democrat opposit bundestag polit delic turn point number asylum seeker germani high accord figur offic migrat refuge peopl appli asylum januari septemb year syria afghanistan turkey number could reach end year accord expert addit million ukrainian arriv sinc februari exempt asylum procedur
Macron faces dilemma over role at march against anti-Semitism,    It is still unclear whether the French president will attend the Paris march on Sunday. The only near-certainty is that he will be speaking on the subject in the next few days. ,"To go or not to go? Since the announcement, on the evening of Tuesday, November 7, that a ""great civic march"" against anti-Semitism would take place this Sunday in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron has been on the fence. Informed on Monday of the initiative spearheaded by Yaël Braun-Pivet, the president of the Assemblée Nationale, and Gérard Larcher, the president of the French Sénat, the head of state has been leaning towards not attending the march in person. But he plans to express himself on the subject between now and Sunday, in one form or another.The question of his participation in an event led by two major players in the French political establishment, one left-leaning (Braun-Pivet) and the other conservative (Larcher), is a dilemma for Macron. It comes as the country faces an upsurge in anti-Semitic acts since Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, with more than 1,000 recorded since the beginning of the conflict.""It would be great if Emmanuel Macron could be there, as it would give the event a historic dimension,"" said Yonathan Arfi, president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions, on November 9. ""We need this march because Jews in France need to hear the cry from the heart, the solidarity, the outpouring of fraternity from the French towards them in the face of anti-Semitism,"" he insisted.Two former presidents of the Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, several former prime ministers (Jean-Marc Ayrault, Manuel Valls, Bernard Cazeneuve, Edouard Philippe), and the presidents of the Assemblée Nationale and the Sénat will be at the front of the demonstration, which starts at 3 pm on Sunday from the Place des Invalides. Valls said that ""the presence of the President of the Republic would give this march a sense of national unity, and a dimension of overcoming divisions.""Jonathan Guémas, the response director of Macron's Renaissance party, said ""the real question is whether the place of a president is to be among the French or in action, setting the state in motion.""

Ohio votes to enshrine right to abortion in state constitution,"    Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment that ensures access to abortion and other forms of reproductive health care, the latest victory for abortion rights supporters since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. ","Residents of Ohio voted on Tuesday, November 7, to enshrine the right to an abortion in the Republican-run US state's constitution, American media projected, in what could be a bellwether for an issue that is likely to dominate next year's presidential race. With a little more than half of the votes counted, US media, including CNN and ABC News, said the referendum on so-called Issue 1 would pass with more ""yes"" votes, approving an amendment to the state constitution that would affirm the right to ""make and carry out one's own reproductive decisions,"" including abortion.President Joe Biden, who has made abortion rights a keystone issue of his presidency, said Ohioans ""voted to protect their fundamental freedoms."" ""Ohioans and voters across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy,"" Biden said in a statement, referring to his likely 2024 opponent Donald Trump's slogan ""Make America Great Again."" Biden also called efforts to curb reproductive rights ""extreme and dangerous.""With the 2024 election looming, America's political watchers have their eyes on Ohio, where activists on both sides of the reproductive rights issue have waged a fierce, multi-million-dollar campaign. Tuesday's vote comes 17 months after the Supreme Court struck down the national right to abortion, paving the way for some states to completely outlaw the practice, even in cases of rape or incest.In Ohio, the reversal of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision triggered a state law that would ban all abortions after a heartbeat is detected in the womb – usually around six weeks of gestation before many people even know they are pregnant. The law is currently suspended as it winds its way through legal challenges, meaning that for now, it is still possible to obtain an abortion in Ohio up to about 22 weeks of pregnancy. But it sparked a national outcry for the short time it was allowed to remain in effect last year when a 10-year-old rape survivor was forced to travel to neighboring Indiana for an abortion after being denied care at home.A ""yes"" vote victory on Ohio's referendum, known as Issue 1, enshrines the right for the state's residents to ""make and carry out one's own reproductive decisions,"" including on abortion. It does, however, allow abortions to be prohibited after ""fetal viability"" – when a fetus can survive on its own outside the womb – unless a doctor believes a pregnant patient's life or health is in danger.An August measure that would have made Ohio constitutional amendments harder to achieve – put up for a vote in direct response to the looming abortion referendum – was soundly defeated. But voters in the state – won by Trump in 2016 and 2020 – have drifted right.Governor Mike DeWine warned that the ballot language would open the door to abortions at ""any time during the pregnancy,"" with the possibility of minors obtaining abortions without their parents' knowledge. The ""Yes"" camp has called that kind of framing ""disinformation.""Many conservative US voters – if not their elected representatives – have expressed reservations about how far restrictions on abortion have gone after the overturning of Roe. Over the past year, multiple states including California, Kansas and Kentucky voted to preserve abortion rights or voted down efforts to restrict them.Conservative-leaning Kentucky on Tuesday was projected to re-elect incumbent Democratic Governor Andy Beshear, who made abortion rights a key issue in his battle against Republican Daniel Cameron. In Virginia, Republicans hope a win in legislative races will allow them to tighten abortion restrictions.",Global-issues,residents ohio voted tuesday november enshrine right abortion republican run

Amazon faces legal action for homophobic chants broadcast during PSG match,"    During the September 24 match between PSG and Marseille, thousands of PSG supporters chanted homophobic slurs referring to their opponents. Four PSG players were given suspended one-match bans for joining in the chants. ","A French gay rights group said on Wednesday, November 8, it had launched legal action against Amazon Prime for offering on streaming replay a football match between Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille in which homophobic chants were audible.During the September 24 match between the bitter Ligue 1 rivals, thousands of PSG supporters chanted homophobic slogans referring to their opponents. An Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporter covering the game said the chanting in PSG's Parc des Princes stadium went on for around 10 minutes.Four PSG players, including Randal Kolo Muani and Ousmane Dembélé, were given suspended one-match bans for also chanting insults directed at the Marseille players while celebrating their 4-0 thrashing of their opponents.A lawyer for the LGBT Families group said it had filed a criminal complaint against Amazon Prime for offering the game on replay, noting that while broadcasters are not responsible for offensive content that may occur during a live match they are liable for content offered on replay.The complaint says that during the replay, ""you can hear several chants from fans coming from the stands, some of which are distinctly homophobic in nature.""Two other LGBT rights groups, Mousse and Stop Homophobie, have said they will also join the complaint against Amazon for public insults and incitement to hatred or violence against people based on their sexual orientation.Amazon said that the match was no longer available on Prime Video at the time the complaint was announced and that, as a broadcaster, it did not condone the comments or behavior of certain fans. ""Homophobia has no place in sport or in society, and we condemn it, like all forms of discrimination, in the strongest possible terms"", an Amazon spokesperson told AFP.The four PSG players sanctioned last month over the chants – Kolo Muani, Dembele, Achraf Hakimi and Layvin Kurzawa – apologized for their behavior, saying they got ""carried away"" by their trouncing of Marseille and promised in future to ""respect our duty to set an example."" PSG for its part was ordered to close the Auteuil stand of the Parc des Princes for one game.The Rouge Direct (Straight Red Card) group, which campaigns against homophobia in sport, backed the complaint against Amazon Prime as part of what it called the ""fight against the trivialisation of homophobia in football"".It said that Amazon Prime had promised, following an earlier complaint this year, to stop broadcasting homophobic chants during replays, and accused the streaming giant of betraying its word.A poll published in September by the Federation Sportive LGBT+ association showed homophobia continued to be rampant in French sport, with 46% of those questioned said they themselves had seen homophobic or transphobic behavior in sports.Last season, several Ligue 1 players refused an invitation to wear rainbow-coloured insignia on their jerseys as a gesture against homophobia, a campaign supported, however, by the vast majority of players.",Global-issues,french gay rights group said wednesday november launched legal action amazon prime offering streaming replay football match paris saint germain marseille homophobic chants audible september match bitter ligue rivals thousands psg supporters chanted homophobic slogans referring opponents agence france presse afp reporter covering game said chanting psgs parc des princes stadium went around minutes four psg players including randal kolo muani ousmane demb given suspended one match bans also chanting insults directed marseille players celebrating thrashing opponents lawyer lgbt families group said filed criminal complaint amazon prime offering game replay noting broadcasters responsible offensive content may occur live match liable content offered replay complaint says replay hear several chants fans coming stands distinctly homophobic nature two lgbt rights groups mousse stop homophobie said also join complaint amazon public insults incitement hatred violence people based sexual orientation amazon said match longer available prime video time complaint announced broadcaster condone comments behavior certain fans homophobia place sport society condemn like forms discrimination strongest possible terms amazon spokesperson told afp four psg players sanctioned last month chants kolo muani dembele achraf hakimi layvin kurzawa apologized behavior saying got carried away trouncing marseille promised future respect duty set example psg part ordered close auteuil stand parc des princes one game rouge direct straight red card group campaigns homophobia sport backed complaint amazon prime part called fight trivialisation homophobia football said amazon prime promised following earlier complaint year stop broadcasting homophobic chants replays accused streaming giant betraying word poll published september federation sportive lgbt association showed homophobia continued rampant french sport questioned said seen homophobic transphobic behavior sports last season several ligue players refused invitation wear rainbow coloured insignia jerseys gesture homophobia campaign supported however vast majority players,french gay right group said wednesday novemb launch legal action amazon prime offer stream replay footbal match pari saint germain marseil homophob chant audibl septemb match bitter ligu rival thousand psg support chant homophob slogan refer oppon agenc franc press afp report cover game said chant psg parc de princ stadium went around minut four psg player includ randal kolo muani ousman demb given suspend one match ban also chant insult direct marseil player celebr thrash oppon lawyer lgbt famili group said file crimin complaint amazon prime offer game replay note broadcast respons offens content may occur live match liabl content offer replay complaint say replay hear sever chant fan come stand distinctli homophob natur two lgbt right group mouss stop homophobi said also join complaint amazon public insult incit hatr violenc peopl base sexual orient amazon said match longer avail prime video time complaint announc broadcast condon comment behavior certain fan homophobia place sport societi condemn like form discrimin strongest possibl term amazon spokesperson told afp four psg player sanction last month chant kolo muani dembel achraf hakimi layvin kurzawa apolog behavior say got carri away trounc marseil promis futur respect duti set exampl psg part order close auteuil stand parc de princ one game roug direct straight red card group campaign homophobia sport back complaint amazon prime part call fight trivialis homophobia footbal said amazon prime promis follow earlier complaint year stop broadcast homophob chant replay accus stream giant betray word poll publish septemb feder sportiv lgbt associ show homophobia continu rampant french sport question said seen homophob transphob behavior sport last season sever ligu player refus invit wear rainbow colour insignia jersey gestur homophobia campaign support howev vast major player
US approves first vaccine against chikungunya virus,"    The vaccine, which will be marketed under the name Ixchiq, was approved for people 18 and over who are at increased risk of exposure, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday. The US drug regulator's decision is expected to speed the vaccine's rollout in countries where the virus is most prevalent. ","US health authorities on Thursday, November 9, approved the world's first vaccine for chikungunya, a virus spread by infected mosquitoes that the Food and Drug Administration called ""an emerging global health threat.""The vaccine, developed by Europe's Valneva which will be marketed under the name Ixchiq, was approved for people 18 and over who are at increased risk of exposure, the FDA said.Ixchiq's green light by the US drug regulator is expected to speed the vaccine's rollout in countries where the virus is most prevalent. Chikungunya, which causes fever and severe joint pain, is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia and part of the Americas. ""However, chikungunya virus has spread to new geographical areas causing a rise in global prevalence of the disease,"" the FDA said, reporting more than 5 million cases in the past 15 years.""Infection with chikungunya virus can lead to severe disease and prolonged health problems, particularly for older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions,"" senior FDA official Peter Marks said in a statement. ""Today's approval addresses an unmet medical need and is an important advancement in the prevention of a potentially debilitating disease with limited treatment options.""The vaccine is injected in one dose and contains a live, weakened version of the chikungunya virus, as is standard with other vaccines.Two clinical trials were carried out in North America on 3,500 people.

"On the French-Italian border, migrant arrivals increase, as do pushbacks",Feature,"Of all the crossing points between France and Italy, the Saint-Louis bridge is undoubtedly the most picturesque. Imagine a road suspended on a rock face between Menton, a town in the south-east of France, and Grimaldi, in Italy: on one side, the steep, cave-carved mountains; on the other, a landscape of terraced farmland running down to the coast. Far below, the Mediterranean glowed mauve on this early autumn morning, when the sun was not yet shining.But this sublime place was filled with a sense of despair. For every day, this stretch of road, framed by the police stations of both countries, plays host to a tragic ballet of migrants who come and go, a long procession of unfortunate people expelled from France. Handed over to the Italian police, they will try their luck first once, 10 times, 20 times, until they manage to cross this border on which France has re-established controls since 2015. ""In the end, most of them make it,"" said Loïc Le Dall, a member of the local branch of the Association Nationale d'Assistance aux Frontières pour les Etrangers (ANAFE). Some even take the most dangerous routes, such as on the roofs of trains or the vertiginous path known here as the ""pas de la mort."" But in the meantime, they are caught up in a strange game of political-police ping-pong, which has become both a legal and humanitarian headache.What could this woman standing on the parapet between the two border posts have been thinking? With her face pressed against the fence, she looked out over the sea and beyond to the lights of Menton. Near her, two very young children were shivering in their cotton clothes. Further on, her husband climbed the slope pulling a small suitcase. They were Kurds, fleeing Turkey for political reasons, they said.In their group, formed by chance contact with a people smuggler, was another family with children and a teenager accompanied by his mother. Poyraz was 17 years old, wearing his headphones on his neck, and he wanted to make something clear by quickly making a sign of the cross, with his back turned so that his companions couldn't see him: ""We're Orthodox,"" he said quietly. ""It's very difficult for us in Turkey.""Three steps away, two Nigerians looked up at a blue sign on the side of the road: ""Menton, the pearl of France, is happy to welcome you."" With empty hands, they looked distraught, lost. They had nothing, no suitcase, no telephone, no headphones and not a single bag, even a paper one – even in extreme misery, there are hierarchies. Above all, like many migrants, they had very few words in English or French to explain their situation. The oldest managed to formulate a question, putting together a few scraps of English: ""Why don't they let us in?""",Global-issues,crossing points france italy saint louis bridge undoubtedly imagine road suspended rock face menton town south east france grimaldi italy one side steep cave carved mountains landscape terraced farmland running coast far mediterranean glowed mauve early autumn morning sun yet shining sublime place filled sense despair every day stretch road framed police stations countries plays host tragic ballet migrants come long procession unfortunate people expelled france handed italian police try luck first times times manage cross border france established controls since end make said dall member local branch association nationale dassistance aux fronti res pour les etrangers anafe even take dangerous routes roofs trains vertiginous path known pas mort meantime caught strange game political police ping pong become legal humanitarian headache could woman standing parapet two border posts thinking face pressed fence looked sea beyond lights menton near two young children shivering cotton clothes husband climbed slope pulling small suitcase kurds fleeing turkey political reasons said group formed chance contact people smuggler another family children teenager accompanied mother poyraz years old wearing headphones neck wanted make something clear quickly making sign cross back turned companions couldnt see orthodox said quietly difficult turkey three steps away two nigerians looked blue sign side road menton pearl france happy welcome empty hands looked distraught lost nothing suitcase telephone headphones single bag even paper one even extreme misery hierarchies like many migrants words english french explain situation oldest managed formulate question putting together scraps english dont let,cross point franc itali saint loui bridg undoubtedli imagin road suspend rock face menton town south east franc grimaldi itali one side steep cave carv mountain landscap terrac farmland run coast far mediterranean glow mauv earli autumn morn sun yet shine sublim place fill sens despair everi day stretch road frame polic station countri play host tragic ballet migrant come long process unfortun peopl expel franc hand italian polic tri luck first time time manag cross border franc establish control sinc end make said dall member local branch associ national dassist aux fronti re pour le etrang anaf even take danger rout roof train vertigin path known pa mort meantim caught strang game polit polic ping pong becom legal humanitarian headach could woman stand parapet two border post think face press fenc look sea beyond light menton near two young children shiver cotton cloth husband climb slope pull small suitcas kurd flee turkey polit reason said group form chanc contact peopl smuggler anoth famili children teenag accompani mother poyraz year old wear headphon neck want make someth clear quickli make sign cross back turn companion couldnt see orthodox said quietli difficult turkey three step away two nigerian look blue sign side road menton pearl franc happi welcom empti hand look distraught lost noth suitcas telephon headphon singl bag even paper one even extrem miseri hierarchi like mani migrant word english french explain situat oldest manag formul question put togeth scrap english dont let
"Pope Francis removes a leading conservative critic as bishop of Tyler, Texas","    It is rare for the pope to remove a bishop from office. Earlier this year, the Vatican sent in investigators to look into his governance of the diocese, amid reports that he was making unorthodox claims. ","Pope Francis on Saturday, November 11, ordered the removal of the bishop of Tyler, Texas, a conservative prelate active on social media who has been a fierce critic of the pontiff and has come to symbolize the polarization within the US Catholic hierarchy.A one-line statement from the Vatican said Francis had ""relieved"" Bishop Joseph Strickland of the pastoral governance of Tyler and appointed the bishop of Austin as the temporary administrator.Strickland, 65, has emerged as a leading critic of Francis, accusing him in a tweet earlier this year of ""undermining the deposit of faith."" He has been particularly critical of Francis' recent meeting on the future of the Catholic Church during which hot-button issues were discussed, including ways to better welcome LGBTQ+ Catholics.Earlier this year, the Vatican sent in investigators to look into his governance of the diocese, amid reports that priests and laypeople in Tyler had complained and that he was making unorthodox claims.The Vatican never released the findings and Strickland had insisted he wouldn't resign voluntarily, saying in media interviews that he was given a mandate to serve as bishop in 2012 by the late Pope Benedict XVI and couldn't abdicate that responsibility.The conservative website LifeSiteNews, which said it interviewed Strickland on Saturday, quoted him as saying one of the reasons given for his ouster was his refusal to implement Francis' 2021 restrictions on celebrating the old Latin Mass.Francis' crackdown on the old liturgy has become a rallying cry for traditionalist Catholics opposed to the pontiff's progressive bent. Strickland told LifeSite he refused to implement the restrictions ""because I can't starve out part of my flock."" He said he stood by his decision, would do it again and ""I feel very much at peace in the Lord and the truth that he died for.""His firing sparked an immediate outcry among some conservatives and traditionalists who had held up Strickland as a leading point of Catholic reference to counter Francis' progressive reforms. Michael J. Matt, editor of the traditionalist newspaper The Remnant, wrote that with the firing, Francis was ""actively trying to bury fidelity to the Church of Jesus Christ."" ""This is total war,"" Matt wrote on X, formerly Twitter.The two Vatican investigators sent to investigate Strickland – Bishop Dennis Sullivan of Camden, NJ, and the retired bishop of Tucson, Arizona, Bishop Emeritus Gerald Kicanas – ""conducted an exhaustive inquiry into all aspects of the governance and leadership of the diocese,"" said the head of the church in Texas, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo.After their investigation, a recommendation was made to Francis that ""the continuation in office of Bishop Strickland was not feasible,"" DiNardo said in a statement Saturday. The Vatican asked Strickland to resign Thursday, but he declined, prompting Francis to remove him from office two days later, DiNardo's statement said.It is rare for the pope to remove a bishop from office. Bishops are required to offer to resign when they reach 75. When the Vatican uncovers issues with governance or other problems that require a bishop to leave office before then, the Vatican usually seeks to pressure him to offer to resign for the good of his diocese and the church.That was the case when another US bishop was forced out earlier this year following a Vatican investigation. Bishop Richard Stika of Knoxville, Tennessee, resigned voluntarily, albeit under pressure, following allegations he mishandled sex abuse allegations and his priests complained about his leadership and behavior. But with Strickland, the Vatican statement made clear that he had not offered to resign and that Francis had instead ""relieved"" him from his job.Francis has not been shy about his concerns about the right wing in the US Catholic hierarchy, which has been split between progressives and conservatives who long found support in the doctrinaire papacies of St. John Paul II and Benedict XVI, particularly on issues of abortion and same-sex marriage.In comments to Portuguese Jesuits in August, Francis blasted the ""backwardness"" of these conservative bishops, saying they had replaced faith with ideology and that a correct understanding of Catholic doctrine allows for change over time.Strickland had been associated with the most extreme of these bishops, including the former Vatican ambassador to the US, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, a fierce Francis critic who in 2018 called for the pope to resign.Strickland backed Vigano's conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 pandemic, and on Saturday Vigano wrote that Strickland's ouster showed a ""cowardly form of authoritarianism"" by Francis. ""This affair will reveal who stands with the true Church of Christ and who chooses to stand with His declared enemies,"" Vigano wrote on X.Most recently, Strickland had criticized Francis' monthlong closed-door debate on making the church more welcoming and responsive to the needs of Catholics today. The meeting debated a host of previously taboo issues, including women in governance roles and welcoming LGBTQ+ Catholics, but in the end, its final document didn't veer from established doctrine.Ahead of the meeting, Strickland said it was a ""travesty"" that such things were even on the table for discussion. ""Regrettably, it may be that some will label as schismatics those who disagree with the changes being proposed,"" Strickland wrote in a public letter in August. ""Instead, those who would propose changes to that which cannot be changed seek to commandeer Christ's Church, and they are indeed the true schismatics.""In a statement Saturday, the diocese of Tyler announced Strickland's removal but said the church's work would continue in Tyler. ""Our mission is to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to foster an authentic Christian community, and to serve the needs of all people with compassion and love,"" it said.",Global-issues,pope francis

Inside the kitchens of migrant women in Tunisia,Feature,"The oil began to bubble. Léna Pouye grabbed four good looking sea bream from the kitchen table and threw them one by one into the pan. The sound of sizzling filled the room. Lying in wait on the doorstep overlooking the street, a ginger cat meowed in disappointment at seeing its prey disappear. Pouye shooed him away with her foot and the little feline immediately returned to his life in the gutters on this warm October afternoon. Two months had passed since 47-year-old Pouye moved with her daughter, 11-year-old Yasmine, to a small apartment in Cité Ettahrir, a working-class district in the west of Tunis. In the room where they live and sleep, divided in two by a partition, everything served as a reminder of her native Senegal: The jersey of the national football team (the Lions of Teranga), the boubou robes, the dried hibiscus flowers, and even the thieb she was preparing, ""the favorite dish of the Senegalese!"" she announced proudly.These little details enable her to keep alive the connection with the country she left 13 years ago to settle in Tunisia and to pass on a little of her cultural heritage to her daughter. They also carry a sense of nostalgia. ""I think about Senegal every day,"" she said wistfully. Before becoming the primary gateway to Europe for migrants, Tunisia had long been a welcoming land for many women from West Africa, lured by the prospect of higher wages than in their home countries. This particular type of immigration was also facilitated by numerous human trafficking networks. But the worsening socio-economic crisis, the rise in racist violence and tensions over the migration issue have all taken their toll on this economic appeal, driving many of them to leave. Those who have stayed are also considering it. ""You shouldn't deny your fate, but even so, I'd like to go somewhere else,"" said Pouye.Despite this urge to leave, the Senegalese woman has spent many years in Tunisia. When she moved there to work as a private chef, she remembered much more hospitable conditions. ""During Ben Ali's time, it wasn't like this. I was comfortable, people respected each other and life was cheaper,"" she said, somewhat nostalgic for the old regime. She then lived through the 2011 revolution, giving birth to Yasmine two years after her arrival. After her divorce, followed by her ex-husband's return to Senegal, Pouye found herself raising her child alone. ""He left me to handle it all,"" she said. ""I was the one who did everything for my daughter. It wasn't easy, but I had to take on my responsibilities.""As a single migrant woman struggling against social injunctions, Pouye has faced many challenges: Educating Yasmine, providing for both of them, navigating the bureaucracy, dealing with the scrutiny and comments of Tunisian society, and holding down several jobs. Her determination, coupled with a strong character, enabled her to overcome it all. ""This is a country of 'mahboul' [madmen, in Tunisian Arabic]. So I have to be even more mahboul,"" she laughed.The Covid pandemic was the last straw. Due to the lockdown, she lost her job, found herself without income and soon without a roof over her head. ""I slept with my daughter in the street because the landlord kicked us out. She cried herself sick,"" she said, her voice filled with pain. Since then, nothing has been the same. Pouye has experienced employment and housing insecurity, moving from apartment to apartment to keep pace with the ever-increasing rents, going through periods without work, and having to deal with the uncertainties of the local economy. ""Before, I used to cook at home, and people would order dishes for 10 or 15 people. But with the shortages, the lack of rice and sugar, how do you expect me to work? What's more, prices have gone up because of inflation, but customers don't want to pay more.""Even back then, she was already thinking about returning to Senegal. But, with a child to support, she tried to bounce back and turned to apprenticeships, convinced that a qualification could open the door to stable employment. She enrolled in a cooking and pastry-making course run by the Ftartchi? organization for migrant women. The course aims to promote ""integration in the workplace,"" explained 29-year-old Yosra Lachheb, an award-winning professional pastry chef and instructor. ""Women work more than men in the pastry business. It's easier for them to get a job in this sector than in others.""A number of former students were able to find regular work after completing their training. However, today, the vast majority of them are no longer in Tunisia. ""Most of the former beneficiaries are now in Europe or back home,"" said Aida, the organization's director, explaining that they were prompted to leave by the wave of racism unleashed on February 21 by President Kais Saied's speech against the ""hordes of illegal migrants.""Despite this, the training courses continue. At the organization's premises, located in the northern suburbs of the capital, a new group gathered around the work surface. ""We let the butter melt until the whey separates from the fat,"" said 34-year-old Rebecca Dyali, diligently. ""This is what we call clarifying the butter,"" added Lachheb, in a teacherly manner. In this large stainless steel kitchen, the notion of integration has given way to aspirations for somewhere else. ""I want to go to Europe,"" said Dyali. ""Well, not necessarily in Europe, but to another country. In any case, I need to know how to do something, and pastry is widely consumed everywhere.""After working in Tunisia for almost three years, she no longer sees herself staying. She blames the insecurity and attacks, the challenges of finding employment and accommodation, and the lack of prospects for the future. Her compatriot, Marcelle Nyabri, who arrived four years ago, shares the same sentiment but is already planning her return. ""If I go back to Côte d'Ivoire, this training will enable me to work independently, to mix our traditional pastry-making traditions with those of Tunisia. It will bring about change,"" she said, excited at the prospect of one day owning her own store.Even Nathalie Diby, one of the standout students from the previous ""class,"" who has now found a job as a cook, was contemplating the future. ""Before I found a job, it was very difficult. Now I feel good here. I'd like to stay in Tunisia, if the pay increases and if I make progress,"" she said, hopeful but realistic. ""The situation has calmed down since February, but who knows how it will develop?"" ""One day, we'll all go back,"" said Dyali.Diby, Dyali and Nyabri are resilient, but most of their friends and acquaintances have already left the country. As for Pouye, she keeps putting off her return for fear of disrupting her daughter. ""How is she going to keep her friends?"" she said. She didn't respond to the repatriation planes that Senegal sent in February after the waves of violence. She considered the departure too hasty after so many years. Nor is she tempted to set sail, which has never been an option for her. She is waiting for the right moment. ""When I return to Senegal, I won't be bringing back wealth but life experience,"" she said. ""I'll be a strong woman, having served in the army here in Tunisia.""",Global-issues,oil began bubble pouye grabbed four good looking sea bream kitchen table threw one one pan sound sizzling filled

"Over 180,000 rally against anti-Semitism across France","    President Macron, who did not attend the demonstrations, condemned on Sunday the 'unbearable resurgence of unbridled anti-Semitism' in the country. ","182,000 people turned out on Sunday, November 12, to march against anti-Semitism across France, including 105,000 in Paris, according to the Ministry of Interior and the police prefecture. ""Our order of the day today is... the total fight against anti-Semitism which is the opposite of the values of the republic,"" Senate speaker Gérard Larcher, who organized the Paris demonstration with Assemblée Nationale speaker Yaël Braun-Pivet, told broadcaster LCP before the marchers set off.Tensions have been rising in the French capital – home to large Jewish and Muslim communities – in the wake of the October 7 attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel, followed by a month of Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Around 500,000 Jewish people live in France, making up Europe's largest community. More than 3,000 police and gendarmes were to be deployed to maintain security at the march.At the front of the march were Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, the two speakers and dignitaries including former presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as religious leaders.Earlier Sunday, thousands of people also gathered in major French cities including Lyon, Nice and Strasbourg behind the same slogan as the Paris march: ""For the Republic, against anti-Semitism"".""Everyone should feel like it's their business"" to combat anti-Jewish feeling, France's chief rabbi Haim Korsia told broadcaster Radio J.On the eve of the march, President Emmanuel Macron – who did not attend Sunday – condemned the ""unbearable resurgence of unbridled anti-Semitism"" in the country. ""A France where our Jewish citizens are afraid is not France,"" he wrote in a letter published in Saturday's Le Parisien. Macron condemned the ""confusion"" surrounding the rally and said it was being ""exploited"" by some politicians for their own ends.The hard-left La France Insoumise (LFI) party boycotted the event which the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party members attended. LFI leader Jean-Luc Melenchon rejected the march as a meeting of ""friends of unconditional support for the massacre"" of Palestinians in Gaza. A separate rally against anti-Semitism that LFI organized in western Paris was disrupted on Sunday morning by counter-demonstrators.Far-right leader Marine Le Pen – who also encountered protesters as she arrived to the main march – declared the demonstration should also serve to stand against ""Islamic fundamentalism"", a pet theme of her anti-immigrant party. The RN was known for decades as the Front National (FN), led by her father Jean-Marie Le Pen – a convicted Holocaust denier. Aiming to show the party has changed, ""We are exactly where we should be"" taking part in the march, Le Pen told reporters shortly before it began, calling any objections ""petty political quibbles"".Communist leader Fabien Roussel said he would ""not march alongside"" the RN. Other left-wing parties as well as youth and rights organisations marched behind a common banner separated from the far right.Prime Minister Borne said Sunday, ""There is no place for posturing"" at the march, writing on X that ""this is a vital battle for national cohesion"". Borne's own father survived the Nazi death camp Auschwitz in occupied Poland, only to take his own life when she was 11.The march took place a day after several thousand people demonstrated in Paris under the rallying cry ""Stop the massacre in Gaza"".

Brussels attack suspect dies after being shot by police,    Belgian police opened fire on the man suspected of shooting and killing two people on Monday night in Brussels. ,"Belgian police on Tuesday, October 17, shot dead a man suspected of killing two Swedish football fans in what authorities said was a terrorist attack. The weapon believed to have been used by the man in the attack was recovered, Belgian Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden.The suspected attacker, Abdessalem Lassoued, a 45-year-old Tunisian, was found by police on Tuesday morning in a café in the neighborhood of Schaerbeek. After police shot him, he was taken to hospital, where he died of his injuries.Belgium's Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden wrote on X: ""The perpetrator of the terrorist attack in Brussels has been identified and has died. We thank intelligence and security services as well as the public prosecutor's office for their quick and decisive action yesterday evening and this morning.""Prime Minister Alexander de Croo earlier on Tuesday said the suspect was a man of Tunisian origin who had been living in the country illegally.""The terrorist attack that happened yesterday was committed with total cowardice, the attacker chose as a target two Swedish football fans,"" de Croo told a news conference, adding that a third person was seriously wounded.Sweden expressed its devastation over the shooting – which occurred just before a Belgium-Sweden football match Monday evening – and European leaders were quick to offer their solidarity.Sweden has been at the center of a bitter row this year with Muslim countries after multiple burnings of the Koran, Islam's holy book. In a video posted in Arabic on social media, a man identifying himself as the attacker said ""he was inspired by the Islamic State"" extremist group, prosecutors said.The gunman was wearing a high-visibility orange jacket and fled on a scooter. Belgian authorities raised the terror alert for Brussels to level four or ""very serious"" – the highest – and level three nationally.Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborn said the asylum seeker was convicted in Tunisia ""for common law offenses"" but was not a reported terrorist risk. Prosecutors said in his video, Lassoued had indicated the Swedish nationality of his victims was a motivation, but there appeared to be no links with the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East.""Devastated by the news of two Swedish football supporters murdered in Brussels tonight and a third person being seriously wounded. All my thoughts are with their families and loved ones,"" Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said. ""Swedish authorities are working closely with their Belgian partners to find the murderer,"" he added on social media.As news spread of the killings, the Group F European qualifier match was abandoned at half-time. Some 35,000 fans were held in the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels for two and a half hours, before being evacuated.Officers provided extra protection for Swedish nationals at the game, escorting Sweden's national players directly to the airport to leave safely, Belgium's football association CEO told the RTBF channel.""I am terribly sad. We agreed 100% not to play the second half because of the conditions and out of respect for the victims and their families,"" said Sweden coach Janne Andersson, quoted by the Swedish news agency TT.The shooting took place in the city center's northern districts. Police were alerted to the incident after 7:00 pm local time.In a video shared online by Flemish newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws, the shooter is seen with an automatic weapon on his shoulder, fleeing on a scooter. Four gunshots can be heard in the video. A witness who spoke to the LN24 channel described his shock during the incident. ""I stood there frozen, I didn't move. I was shocked by what happened, even now I am still in shock. It was a man who came, pushed me, told me to start running if I wanted to stay alive,"" said the witness, who gave his name as Sulayman.The president of the European Commission, which is based in Brussels, was quick to condemn the attack. ""My thoughts are with the families of the two victims of the despicable attack in Brussels,"" Ursula von der Leyen posted on social media. ""Together, we stand united against terror,"" she said.French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe was ""shaken"" by an ""Islamist"" attack in Brussels, while France's interior minister had earlier given instructions to strengthen border controls with Belgium. Belgium had already been the target of an attack claimed by Islamic State extremists in March 2016, at Brussels' main airport and on the metro system, which killed 32 people.",Global-issues,belgian
